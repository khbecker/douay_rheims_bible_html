the sum of them with the children of Israel:</span></li>

and all the vessels thereof, and whatsoever pertaineth to the
ceremonies. They shall carry the tabernacle and all the furniture
thereof: and they shall minister, and shall encamp round about the
tabernacle.</span></li>
<li><span>When you are to go forward, the Levites shall take down
the tabernacle: when you are to camp, they shall set it up. What
stranger soever cometh to it, shall be slain.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Israel shall camp every man by his
troops and bands and army.</span></li>
<li><span>But the Levites shall pitch their tents round about the
tabernacle, lest there come indignation upon the multitude of the
children of Israel, and they shall keep watch, and guard the
tabernacle of the testimony.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Israel did according to all things
which the Lord had commanded Moses.</span></li>

<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>All the children of Israel shall camp by their troops,
ensigns, and standards, and the houses of their kindreds, round
about the tabernacle of the covenant.</span></li>
<li><span>On the east Juda shall pitch his tents by the bands of
his army: and the prince of his sons shall be Nahasson the son of
Aminadab.</span></li>
<li><span>And the whole sum of the fighting men of his stock, were

army divided according to the houses of their kindreds and their
troops, six hundred and three thousand five hundred and
fifty.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Levites were not numbered among the children of
Israel: for so the Lord had commanded Moses.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="3">Numbers 3</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>These are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day
that the Lord spoke to Moses in mount Sinai.</span></li>
<li><span>And these the names of the sons of Aaron: his firstborn
Nadab, then Abiu, and Eleazar, and Ithamar.</span></li>
<li><span>These the names of the sons of Aaron the priests that
were anointed, and whose hands were filled and consecrated, to do
the functions of priesthood.</span></li>
<li><span>Now Nadab and Abiu died, without children, when they
offered strange fire before the Lord, in the desert of Sinai: and
Eleazar and Ithamar performed the priestly office in the presence
of Aaron their father.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Bring the tribe of Levi, and make them stand in the sight
of Aaron the priest to minister to him, and let them
watch,</span></li>
<li><span>And observe whatsoever appertaineth to the service of the
multitude before the tabernacle of the testimony,</span></li>
<li><span>And let them keep the vessels of the tabernacle, serving
in the ministry thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt give the Levites for a gift,</span></li>
<li><span>To Aaron and to his sons, to whom they are delivered by
the children of Israel. But thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons
over the service of priesthood. The stranger that approacheth to
minister, shall be put to death.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying :</span></li>
<li><span>I have taken the Levites from the children of Israel, for
every firstborn that openeth the womb among the children of Israel,
and the Levites shall be mine.</span></li>
<li><span>For every firstborn is mine: since I struck the firstborn
in the land of Egypt: I have sanctified to myself whatsoever is
firstborn in Israel both of man and beast, they are mine: I am the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Number the sons of Levi by the houses of their fathers
and their families, every male from one month and
upward.</span></li>
<li><span>Moses numbered them as the Lord had
commanded.</span></li>
<li><span>And there were found sons of Levi by their names, Gerson
and Caath and Merari.</span></li>
<li><span>The sons of Gerson: Lebni and Semei.</span></li>
<li><span>The sons of Caath: Amram, and Jesaar, Hebron and
Oziel:</span></li>
<li><span>The sons of Merari: Moholi and Musi.</span></li>
<li><span>Of Gerson were two families, the Lebnites, and the
Semeites:</span></li>
<li><span>Of which were numbered, people of the male sex from one
month and upward, seven thousand five hundred.</span></li>
<li><span>These shall pitch behind the tabernacle on the
west,</span></li>
<li><span>Under their prince Eliasaph the son of Lael.</span></li>
<li><span>And their charge shall be in the tabernacle of the
covenant:</span></li>
<li><span>The tabernacle itself and the cover thereof, the hanging
that is drawn before the doors of the tabernacle of the covenant,
and the curtains of the court: the hanging also that is hanged in
the entry of the court of the tabernacle, and whatsoever belongeth
to the rite of the altar, the cords of the tabernacle, and all the
furniture thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>Of the kindred of Caath come the families of the
Amramites and Jesaarites and Hebronites and Ozielites. These are
the families of the Caathites reckoned up by their
names:</span></li>
<li><span>All of the male sex from one month and upward, eight
thousand six hundred: they shall have the guard of the
sanctuary,</span></li>
<li><span>And shall camp on the south side.</span></li>
<li><span>And their prince shall be Elisaphan the son of
Oziel:</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall keep the ark, and the table and the
candlestick, the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary,
wherewith they minister, and the veil, and all the furniture of
this kind.</span></li>
<li><span>And the prince of the princes of the Levites, Eleazar,
the son of Aaron the priest, shall be over them that watch for the
guard of the sanctuary.</span></li>
<li><span>And of Merari are the families of the Moholites, and
Musites, reckoned up by their names :</span></li>
<li><span>All of the male kind from one month and upward, six
thousand two hundred.</span></li>
<li><span>Their prince Suriel the son of Abihaiel: they shall camp
on the north side.</span></li>
<li><span>Under their custody shall be the boards of the
tabernacle, and the bars, and the pillars and their sockets, and
all things that pertain to this kind of service:</span></li>
<li><span>And the pillars of the court round about with their
sockets, and the pins with their cords.</span></li>
<li><span>Before the tabernacle of the covenant, that is to say on
the east side, shall Moses and Aaron camp, with their sons, having
the custody of the sanctuary, in the midst of the children of
Israel. What stranger soever cometh unto it, shall be put to
death.</span></li>
<li><span>All the Levites, that Moses and Aaron numbered according
to the precept of the Lord, by their families, of the male kind
from one month and upward, were twenty-two thousand.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Number the firstborn of the
male sex of the children of Israel, from one month and upward, and
thou shalt take the sum of them.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt take the Levites to me for all the
firstborn of the children of Israel, I am the Lord: and their
cattle for all the firstborn of the cattle of the children of
Israel:</span></li>
<li><span>Moses reckoned up, as the Lord had commanded, the
firstborn of the children of Israel:</span></li>
<li><span>And the males by their names, from one month and upward,
were twenty-two thousand two hundred and seventy-three.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saving:</span></li>
<li><span>Take the Levites for the firstborn of the children of
Israel, and the cattle of the Levites for their cattle, and the
Levites shall be mine. I am the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>But for the price of the two hundred and seventy-three,
of the firstborn of the children of Israel, that exceed the number
of the Levites,</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt take five sides for every head, according to
the weight of the sanctuary. A sicle hath twenty obols.</span></li>
<li><span>And then shalt give the money to Aaron and his sons, the
price of them that are above.</span></li>
<li><span>Moses therefore took the money of them that were above,
and whom they had redeemed from the Levites,</span></li>
<li><span>For the firstborn of the children of Israel, one thousand
three hundred and sixty-five sicles, according to the weight of the
sanctuary,</span></li>
<li><span>And gave it to Aaron and his sons, according to the word
that the Lord had commanded him.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="4">Numbers 4</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, and Aaron,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Take the sum of the sons of Caath from the midst of the
Levites, by their houses and families.</span></li>
<li><span>From thirty years old and upward, to fifty years old, of
all that go in to stand and to minister in the tabernacle of the
covenant.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the service of the sons of Caath:</span></li>
<li><span>When the camp is to set forward, Aaron and his sons shall
go into the tabernacle of the covenant, and the holy of holies, and
shall take down the veil that hangeth before the door, and shall
wrap up the ark of the testimony in it,</span></li>
<li><span>And shall cover it again with a cover of violet skins,
and shall spread over it a cloth all of violet, and shall put in
the bars.</span></li>
<li><span>They shall wrap up also the table of proposition in a
cloth of violet, and shall put with it the censers and little
mortars, the cups and bowls to pour out the libations: the leaves
shall be always on it:</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall spread over it a cloth of scarlet, which
again they shall cover with a covering of violet skins, and shall
put in the bars.</span></li>
<li><span>They shall take also a cloth of violet wherewith they
shall cover the candlestick with the lamps and tongs thereof and
the snuffers and all the oil vessels, which are necessary for the
dressing of the lamps :</span></li>
<li><span>And over all they shall put a cover of violet skins and
put in the bars.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall wrap up the golden altar also in a cloth
of violet, and shall spread over it a cover of violet skins, and
put in the bars.</span></li>
<li><span>All the vessels wherewith they minister in the sanctuary,
they shall wrap up in a cloth of violet, and shall spread over it a
cover of violet skins, and put in the bars.</span></li>
<li><span>They shall cleanse the altar also from the ashes, and
shall wrap it up in a purple cloth,</span></li>
<li><span>And shall put it with all the vessels that they use in
the ministry thereof, that is to say, firepans, fleshhooks and
forks, pothooks and shovels. They shall cover all the vessels of
the altar together with a covering of violet skins, and shall put
in the bars.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Aaron and his sons have wrapped up the sanctuary
and the vessels thereof at the removing of the camp, then shall the
sons of Caath enter in to carry the things wrapped up: and they
shall not touch the vessels of the sanctuary, lest they die. These
are the burdens of the sons of Caath: in the tabernacle of the
covenant:</span></li>
<li><span>And over them shall be Eleazar the son of Aaron the
priest, to whose charge pertaineth the oil to dress the lamps, and
the sweet incense, and the sacrifice, that is always offered, and
the oil of unction, and whatsoever pertaineth to the service of the
tabernacle, and of all the vessels that are in the
sanctuary.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Destroy not the people of Caath from the midst of the
Levites:</span></li>
<li><span>But do this to them, that they may live, and not die, by
touching the holies of holies. Aaron and his sons shall go in, and
they shall appoint every man his work, and shall divide the burdens
that every man is to carry.</span></li>
<li><span>Let not others by any curiosity see the things that are
in the sanctuary before they be wrapped up, otherwise they shall
die.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Take the sum of the soils of Gerson also by their houses
and families and kindreds.</span></li>
<li><span>From thirty Sears old and upward, unto fifty years old.
Number them all that go in and minister in the tabernacle of the
covenant.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the office of the family of the Gersonites
:</span></li>
<li><span>To carry the curtains of the tabernacle and the roof of
the covenant, the other covering, and the violet covering over all,
and the hanging that hangeth in the entry of the tabernacle of the
covenant,</span></li>
<li><span>The curtains of the court, and the veil in the entry that
is before the tabernacle. All things that pertain to the altar, the
cords and the vessels of the ministry,</span></li>
<li><span>The sons of Gerson shall carry, by the commandment of
Aaron and his sons: and each man shall know to what burden he must
be assigned.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the service of the family of the Gersonites in
the tabernacle of the covenant, and they shall be under the hand of
Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt reckon up the sons of Merari also by the
families and houses of their fathers,</span></li>
<li><span>From thirty years old and upward, unto fifty years old,
all that go in to the office of their ministry, and to the service
of the covenant of the testimony.</span></li>
<li><span>These are their burdens: They shall carry the boards of
the tabernacle and the bars thereof, the pillars and their
sockets,</span></li>
<li><span>The pillars also of the court round about, with their
sockets and pins and cords. They shall receive by account all the
vessels and furniture, and so shall carry them.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the office of the family of the Merarites, and
their ministry in the tabernacle of the covenant: and they shall be
under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.</span></li>
<li><span>So Moses and Aaron and the princes of the synagogue
reckoned up the sons of Caath, by their kindreds and the houses of
their fathers,</span></li>
<li><span>From thirty years old and upward, unto fifty years old,
all that go in to the ministry of the tabernacle of the
covenant:</span></li>
<li><span>And they were found two thousand seven hundred and
fifty.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the number of the people of Caath that go in to

<ol>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Command the children of Israel, that they cast out of the
camp every leper, and whosoever hath an issue of seed, or is
defiled by the dead:</span></li>
<li><span>Whether it be man or woman, cast ye them out of the camp,
lest they defile it when I shall dwell with you.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Israel did so, and they cast them
forth without the camp, as the Lord had spoken to
Moses.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Say to the children of Israel: When a man or woman shall
have committed any of all the sins that men are wont to commit, and
by negligence shall have transgressed the commandment of the Lord,
and offended,</span></li>
<li><span>They shall confess their sin, and restore the principal
itself, and the fifth part over and above, to him against whom they
have sinned.</span></li>
<li><span>But if there be no one to receive it, they shall give it
to the Lord, and it shall be the priest's, besides the ram that is
offered for expiation, to be an atoning sacrifice.</span></li>
<li><span>an the firstfruits also, which the children of Israel
offer, belong to the priest:</span></li>
<li><span>And whatsoever is offered into the sanctuary by every
one, and is delivered into the hands of the priest, it shall be
his.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to
them: The man whose wife shall have gone astray, and contemning her
husband,</span></li>
<li><span>Shall have slept with another man, and her husband cannot
discover it, but the adultery is secret, and cannot be proved by
witnesses, because she was not found in the adultery:</span></li>
<li><span>If the spirit of jealousy stir up the husband against his
wife, who either is defiled, or is charged with false
suspicion,</span></li>
<li><span>He shall bring her to the priest, and shall offer an
oblation for her, the tenth part of a measure of barley meal: he
shall not pour oil thereon, nor put frank- incense upon it: because
it is a sacrifice of jealousy, and an oblation searching out
adultery.</span></li>
<li><span>The priest therefore shall offer it, and set it before
the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall take holy water in an earthen vessel, and he
shall cast a little earth of the pavement of the tabernacle into
it.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the woman shall stand before the Lord, he shall
uncover her head, and shall, put on her hands the sacrifice of
remembrance, and the oblation of jealousy: and he himself shall
hold the most bitter waters, whereon he hath heaped curses with
execration.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall adjure her, and shall say: If another man
hath not slept with thee, and if thou be not defiled by forsaking
thy husband's bed, these most bitter waters, on which I have heaped
curses, shall not hurt thee.</span></li>
<li><span>But if thou hast gone aside from thy husband, and art
defiled, and hast lain with another man:</span></li>
<li><span>These curses shall light upon thee: The Lord make thee a
curse, and an example for all among his people: may he make thy
thigh to rot, and may thy belly swell and burst
asunder.</span></li>
<li><span>Let the cursed waters enter into thy belly, and may thy
womb swell and thy thigh rot. And the woman shall answer, Amen,
amen.</span></li>
<li><span>And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and
shall wash them out with the most bitter waters, upon which he hath
heaped the curses,</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall give them her to drink. And when she hath
drunk them up,</span></li>
<li><span>The priest shall take from her hand the sacrifice of
jealousy, and shall elevate it before the Lord, and shall put it
upon the altar: yet so as first,</span></li>
<li><span>To take a handful of the sacrifice of that which is
offered, and burn it upon the altar: and so give the most bitter
waters to the woman to drink.</span></li>
<li><span>And when she hath drunk them, if she be defiled, and
having despised her husband be guilty of adultery, the malediction
shall go through her, and her belly swelling, her thigh shall rot:
and the woman shall be a curse, and an example to all the
people.</span></li>
<li><span>But if she be not defiled, she shall not be hurt, and
shall bear children.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the law of jealousy. If a woman hath gone aside
from her husband, and be defiled,</span></li>
<li><span>And the husband stirred up by the spirit of jealousy
bring her before the Lord, and the priest do to her according to
all things that are here written:</span></li>
<li><span>The husband shall be blameless, and she shall bear her
iniquity.</span></li>

<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to
them: When a man, or woman, shall make a vow to be sanctified, and
will consecrate themselves to the Lord:</span></li>
<li><span>They shall abstain from wine, and from every thing that
may make a man drunk. They shall not drink vinegar of wine, or of
any other drink, nor any thing that is pressed out of the grape:
nor shall they eat grapes either fresh or dried.</span></li>
<li><span>All the days that they are consecrated to the Lord by
vow: they shall eat nothing that cometh of the vineyard, from the
raisin even to the kernel.</span></li>
<li><span>All the time of his separation no razor shall pass over
his head, until the day be fulfilled of his consecration to the
Lord. He shall be holy, and shall let the hair of his head
grow.</span></li>
<li><span>All the time of his consecration he shall not go in to
any dead,</span></li>
<li><span>Neither shall he make himself unclean, even for his
father, or for his mother, or for his brother, or for his sister,
when they die, because the consecration of his God is upon his
head.</span></li>
<li><span>All the days of his separation he shall be holy to the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>But if any man die suddenly before him: the head of his
consecration shall be defiled: and he shall shave it forthwith on
the same day of his purification, and again on the seventh
day.</span></li>
<li><span>And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two
young pigeons to the priest in the entry of the covenant of the
testimony.</span></li>
<li><span>And the priest shall offer one for sin, and the other for
a holocaust, and shall pray for him, for that he hath sinned by the
dead: and he shall sanctify his head that day :</span></li>
<li><span>And shall consecrate to the Lord the days of his
separation, offering a lamb of one year for sin: yet so that the
former days be made void, because his sanctification was
profaned.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the law of consecration. When the days which he
had determined by vow shall be expired, he shall bring him to the
door of the tabernacle of the covenant,</span></li>
<li><span>And shall offer his oblation to the Lord: one he lamb of
a year old without blemish for a holocaust, and one awe lamb of a
year old without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without
blemish for a victim of peace offering,</span></li>
<li><span>A basket also of unleavened bread, tempered with oil, and
wafers without leaven anointed with oil, and the libations of
each:</span></li>
<li><span>And the priest shall present them before the Lord, and
shall offer both the sin offering and the holocaust.</span></li>
<li><span>But the ram he shall immolate for a sacrifice of peace
offering to the Lord, offering at the same time the basket of
unleavened bread, and the libations that are due by
custom.</span></li>
<li><span>Then shall the hair of the consecration of the Nazarite,
be shaved off before the door of the tabernacle of the covenant:
and he shall take his hair, and lay it upon the fire, which is
under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.</span></li>
<li><span>And shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one
unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and he
shall deliver them into the hands of the Nazarite, after his head
is shaven.</span></li>
<li><span>And receiving them again from him, he shall elevate them
in the sight of the Lord: and they being sanctified shall belong to
the priest, as the breast, which was commanded to be separated, and
the shoulder. After this the Nazarite may drink wine.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the law of the Nazarite, when he hath vowed his
oblation to the Lord in the time of his consecration, besides those
things which his hand shall find, according to that which he had
vowed in his mind, so shall he do for the fulfilling of his
sanctification.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Say to Aaron and his sons: Thus shall you bless the
children of Israel, and you shall say to them:</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord bless thee, and keep thee.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord shew his face to thee, and have mercy on
thee.</span></li>

<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Speak to Aaron, and thou shalt say to him: When thou
shalt place the seven lamps, let the candlestick be set up on the
south side. Give orders therefore that the lamps look over against
the north, towards the table of the leaves of proposition, over
against that part shall they give light, towards which the
candlestick looketh.</span></li>
<li><span>And Aaron did so, and he put the lamps upon the
candlestick, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</span></li>
<li><span>Now this was the work of the candlestick, it was of
beaten gold, both the shaft in the middle, and all that came out of
both sides of the branches: according to the pattern which the Lord
had shewn to Moses, so he made the candlestick.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying :</span></li>
<li><span>Take the Levites out of the midst of the children of
Israel, and thou shalt purify them,</span></li>
<li><span>According to this rite: Let them be sprinkled with the
water of purification, and let them shave all the hairs of their
flesh. And when they shall have washed their garments, and are
cleansed,</span></li>
<li><span>They shall take an ox of the herd, and for the offering
thereof fine flour tempered with oil: and thou shalt take another
ox of the herd for a sin offering:</span></li>

of the Lord from the children of Israel, that they may serve in his
ministry.</span></li>
<li><span>The Levites also shall put their hands upon the heads of
the oxen, of which thou shalt sacrifice one for sin, and the other
for a holocaust to the Lord, to pray for them.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt set the Levites in the sight of Aaron and

Lord,</span></li>
<li><span>And shalt separate them from the midst of the children of
Israel, to be mine.</span></li>
<li><span>And afterwards they shall enter into the tabernacle of
the covenant, to serve me. And thus shalt thou purify and
consecrate them for an oblation of the Lord: for as a gift they
were given me by the children of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>I have taken them instead of the firstborn that open
every womb in Israel,</span></li>
<li><span>For all the firstborn of the children of Israel, both of
men and of beasts, are mine. From the day that I slew every
firstborn in the land of Egypt, have I sanctified them to
myself:</span></li>
<li><span>And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the
children of Israel:</span></li>
<li><span>And have delivered them for a gift to Aaron and his sons
out of the midst of the people, to serve me for Israel in the
tabernacle of the covenant, and to pray for them, lest there should
be a plague among the people, if they should presume to approach
unto my sanctuary.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses and Aaron and all the multitude of the children

Moses:</span></li>

Aaron lifted them up in the sight of the Lard, and prayed for
them,</span></li>
<li><span>That being purified they might go into the tabernacle of
the covenant to do their services before Aaron and his sons. As the
Lord had commanded Moses touching the Levites, so was it
done.</span></li>

<li><span>This is the law of the Levites: From twenty-five years
old and upwards, they shall go in to minister in the tabernacle of
the covenant.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they shall have accomplished the fiftieth year
of their age, they shall cease to serve:</span></li>

to their care, but not to do the works. Thus shalt thou order the

<li><span>Say to the children of Israel: The man that shall be
unclean by occasion of one that is dead, or shall be in a journey
afar off in your nation, let him make the phase to the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>In the second month, on the fourteenth day of the month
in the evening, they shall eat it with unleavened bread and wild
lettuce:</span></li>
<li><span>They shall not leave any thing thereof until morning, a
nor break a bone thereof, they shall observe all the ceremonies of
the phase.</span></li>
<li><span>But if any man is clean, and was not on a journey, and
did not make the phase, that soul shall be cut off from among his
people, because he offered not sacrifice to the Lord in due season:
he shall bear his sin.</span></li>
<li><span>The sojourner also and the stranger if they be among you,
shall make the phase to the Lord according to the ceremonies and
justifications thereof. The same ordinance shall be with you both
for the stranger, and for him that was born in the
land.</span></li>
<li><span>Now on the day that the tabernacle was reared up, a cloud
covered it. But from the evening there was over the tabernacle, as
it were, the appearance of fire until the morning.</span></li>
<li><span>So it was always: by day the cloud covered it, and by
night as it were the appearance of fire.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the cloud that covered the tabernacle was taken
up, then the children of Israel marched forward: and in the place
where the cloud stood still, there they camped.</span></li>
<li><span>At the commandment of the Lord they marched, and at his
commandment they pitched the tabernacle. All the days that the
cloud abode over the tabernacle, they remained in the same
place:</span></li>
<li><span>And if it was so that it continued over it a long time,
the children of Israel kept the watches of the Lord, and marched
not,</span></li>
<li><span>For as many days soever as the cloud stayed over the
tabernacle. At the commandment of the Lord they pitched their
tents, and at his commandment they took them down.</span></li>
<li><span>If the cloud tarried from evening until morning, and
immediately at break of day left the tabernacle, they marched
forward: and if it departed after a day and a night, they took down
their tents.</span></li>
<li><span>But if it remained over the tabernacle for two days or a
month or a longer time, the children of Israel remained in the same
place, and marched not: but immediately as soon as it departed,
they removed the camp.</span></li>
<li><span>By the word of the Lord they pitched their tents, and by
his word they marched: and kept the watches of the Lord according
to his commandment by the hand of Moses.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="10">Numbers 10</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Make thee two trumpets of beaten silver, wherewith thou
mayest call together the multitude when the camp is to be
removed.</span></li>
<li><span>And when thou shalt sound the trumpets, all the multitude
shall gather unto thee to the door of the tabernacle of the
covenant.</span></li>
<li><span>If thou sound but once, the princes and the heads of the
multitude of Israel shall come to thee.</span></li>
<li><span>But if the sound of the trumpets be longer, and with
interruptions, they that are on the east side, shall first go
forward.</span></li>
<li><span>And at the second sounding and like noise of the trumpet,
they who lie on the south side shall take up their tents. And after
this manner shall the rest do, when the trumpets shall sound for a
march.</span></li>
<li><span>But when the people is to be gathered together, the sound
of the trumpets shall be plain, and they shall not make a broken
sound.</span></li>
<li><span>And the sons of Aaron the priest shall sound the
trumpets: and this shall be an ordinance for ever in your
generations.</span></li>
<li><span>If you go forth to war out of your land against the
enemies that fight against you, you shall sound aloud with the
trumpets, and there shall be a remembrance of you before the Lord
your God, that you may be delivered out of the hands of your
enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>If at any time you shall have a banquet, end on your
festival days, and on the first days of your months, you shall
sound the trumpets over the holocausts, and the sacrifices of peace
offerings, that they may be to you for a remembrance of your God. I
am the Lord your God.</span></li>
<li><span>The second year, in the second month, the twentieth day
of the month, the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle of the
covenant.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Israel marched by their troops from
the desert of Sinai, and the cloud rested in the wilderness of
Pharan.</span></li>
<li><span>And the first went forward according to the commandment
of the Lord by the hand of Moses.</span></li>
<li><span>The sons of Juda by their troops: whose prince was
Nahasson the son of Aminadab.</span></li>
<li><span>In the tribe of the sons of Issachar, the prince was
Nathanael the son of Suar.</span></li>
<li><span>In the tribe of Zabulon, the prince was Eliab the son of
Helon.</span></li>
<li><span>And the tabernacle was taken down, and the sons of Gerson
and Merari set forward, bearing it.</span></li>
<li><span>And the sons of Ruben also marched, by their troops and
ranks, whose prince was Helisur the son of Sedeur.</span></li>
<li><span>And in the tribe of Simeon, the prince was Salamiel the
son of Surisaddai.</span></li>
<li><span>And in the tribe of Cad, the prince was Eliasaph the son
of Duel.</span></li>
<li><span>Then the Caathites also marched carrying the sanctuary.
So long was the tabernacle carried, till they same to the place of
setting it up.</span></li>
<li><span>The sons of Ephraim also moved their camp by their
troops, in whose army the prince was Elisama the son of
Ammiud.</span></li>
<li><span>And in the tribe of the sons of Manasses, the prince was
Gamaliel the son of Phadassur.</span></li>
<li><span>And in the tribe of Benjamin, the prince was Abidan the
son of Gedeon.</span></li>
<li><span>The last of all the camp marched the sons of Dan by their
troops, in whose army the prince was Ahiezer the son of
Ammisaddai.</span></li>
<li><span>And in the tribe of the sons of Aser, the prince was
Phegiel the son of Ochran.</span></li>
<li><span>And in the tribe of the sons of Nephtali, the prince was
Ahira the son of Enan.</span></li>
<li><span>This was the order of the camps, and marches of the
children of Israel by their troops, when they set
forward.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses said to Hobab the son of Raguel the Madianite,
his kinsman: We are going towards the place which the Lord will
give us: come with us, that we may do thee good : for the Lord hath
promised good things to Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>But he answered him: I will not go with thee, but I will
return to my country, wherein I was born.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said: Do not leave us: for thou knowest in what
places we should encamp in the wilderness, and thou shalt be our
guide.</span></li>
<li><span>And if thou comest with us, we will give thee what is the
best of the riches which the Lord shall deliver to us.</span></li>
<li><span>So they marched from the mount of the Lord three days'
journey, and the ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them,
for three days providing a place for the camp.</span></li>
<li><span>The cloud also of the Lord was over them by day when they
marched.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the ark was lifted up, Moses said: Arise, O
Lord, and let thy enemies be scattered, and let them that hate
thee, flee from before thy face.</span></li>
<li><span>And when it was set down, he said: Return, O Lord, to the
multitude of the host of Israel.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="11">Numbers 11</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>In the mean time there arose a murmuring of the people
against the Lord, as it were repining at their fatigue. And when
the Lord heard it he was angry. And the fire of the Lord being
kindled against them, devoured them that were at the uttermost part
of the camp.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the people cried to Moses, Moses prayed to the
Lord, and the fire was swallowed up.</span></li>
<li><span>And he called the name of that place, The burning: for
that the fire of the Lord had been kindled against
them.</span></li>
<li><span>For a mixt multitude of people, that came up with them,
burned with desire, sitting and weeping, the children of Israel
also being joined with them, and said: Who shall give us flesh to
eat?</span></li>
<li><span>We remember the Ash that we ate in Egypt free cost: the
cucumbers come into our mind, and the melons, and the leeks, and
the onions, and the garlic.</span></li>
<li><span>Our soul is dry, our eyes behold nothing else but
manna.</span></li>
<li><span>A Now the manna was like coriander seed, of the colour of
bdellium.</span></li>
<li><span>And the people went about, and gathering it, ground it in
a mill, or beat it in a mortar, and boiled it in a pot, and made
cakes thereof of the taste of bread tempered with oil.</span></li>
<li><span>and when the dew fell in the night upon the camp, the
manna also fell with it.</span></li>
<li><span>Now Moses heard the people weeping by their families,
every one at the door of his tent. And the wrath of the Lord was
exceedingly enkindled: to Moses also the thing seemed
insupportable.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to the Lord: Why hast thou afflicted thy
servant? wherefore do I not find favour before thee? and why hast
thou laid the weight of all this people upon me ?</span></li>
<li><span>Have I conceived all this multitude, or begotten them,
that thou shouldst say to me: Carry them in thy bosom as the nurse
is wont to carry the little infant, and bear them into the land,
for which thou hast sworn to their fathers?</span></li>
<li><span>Whence should I have flesh to give to so great a
multitude? they weep against me, saying: Give us flesh that we may
eat.</span></li>
<li><span>I am not able alone to bear all this people, because it
is too heavy for me.</span></li>
<li><span>But if it seem unto thee otherwise, I beseech thee to
kill me, and let me find grace in thy eyes, that I be not afflicted
with so great evils.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Gather unto me seventy men of
the ancients of Israel, whom thou knowest to be ancients and
masters of the people: and thou shalt bring them to the door of the
tabernacle of the covenant, and shalt make them stand there with
thee,</span></li>
<li><span>That I may come down and speak with thee: and I will take
of thy spirit, and will give to them, that they may bear with thee
the burden of the people, and thou mayest not be burthened
alone.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt say to the people: Be ye sanctified : to
morrow you shall eat flesh: for I have heard you say: Who will give
us flesh to eat? it was well with us in Egypt. That the Lord may
give you flesh, and you may eat:</span></li>
<li><span>Not for one day, nor two, nor five, nor ten, no nor for
twenty.</span></li>
<li><span>But even for a month of days, till it come out at your
nostrils, and become loathsome to you, because you have cast off
the Lord, who is in the midst of you, and have wept before him,
saying: Why came we out of Egypt?</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses said: There are six hundred thousand footmen of
this people, and sayest thou: I will give them flesh to eat a whole
month?</span></li>
<li><span>Shall then a multitude of sheep and oxen be killed, that
it may suffice for their food? or shall the fishes of the sea be
gathered together to fill them?</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord answered him: Is the hand of the Lord
unable? Thou shalt presently see whether my word shall come to pass
or no.</span></li>
<li><span>Moses therefore came, and told the people the words of
the Lord, and assembled seventy men of the ancients of Israel, and
made them to stand about the tabernacle.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord came down in a cloud, and spoke to him,
taking away of the spirit that was in Moses, and giving to the
seventy men. And when the spirit had rested on them they
prophesied, nor did they cease afterwards.</span></li>
<li><span>Now there remained in the camp two of the men, of whom
one was called Eldad, and the other Medad, upon whom the spirit
rested; for they also had been enrolled, but were not gone forth to
the tabernacle.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they prophesied in the camp, there ran a young
man, and told Moses, saying: Eldad and Medad prophesy in the
camp.</span></li>
<li><span>Forthwith Josue the son of Nun, the minister of Moses,
and chosen out of many, said: My lord Moses forbid
them.</span></li>
<li><span>But he said: Why hast thou emulation for me? O that all
the people might prophesy, and that the Lord would give them his
spirit!</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses returned, with the ancients of Israel, into the
camp.</span></li>
<li><span>And a wind going out from the Lord, taking quails up
beyond the sea brought them, and cast them into the camp for the
space of one day's journey, on every side of the camp round about,
and they flew in the air two cubits high above the
ground.</span></li>
<li><span>The people therefore rising up all that day, and night,
and the next day, gathered together of quails, he that did least,
ten cores: and they dried them round about the camp.</span></li>
<li><span>As yet the flesh was between their teeth, neither had
that kind of meat failed: when behold the wrath of the Lord being
provoked against the people, struck them with an exceeding great
plague.</span></li>
<li><span>And that place was called, The graves of lust: for there
they buried the people that had lusted. And departing from the
graves of lust, they came unto Haseroth, and abode
there.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="12">Numbers 12</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And Mary and Aaron spoke against Moses, because of his
wife the Ethiopian,</span></li>
<li><span>And they said: Hath the Lord spoken by Moses only? hath
he not also spoken to us in like manner? And when the Lord heard
this,</span></li>
<li><span>(For Moses was a man exceeding meek above all men that
dwelt upon earth)</span></li>
<li><span>Immediately he spoke to him, and to Aaron and Mary: Come
out you three only to the tabernacle of the covenant. And when they
were come out,</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord came down in a pillar of the cloud, and stood in
the entry of the tabernacle calling to Aaron and Mary. And when
they were come,</span></li>
<li><span>He said to them: Hear my words: if there be among you a
prophet of the Lord, I will appear to him in a vision, or I will
speak to him in a dream.</span></li>
<li><span>But it is not so with my servant Moses a who is most
faithful in all my house:</span></li>
<li><span>For I speak to him mouth to mouth: and plainly, and not
by riddles and figures doth he see the Lord. Why then were you not
afraid to speak ill of my servant Moses?</span></li>
<li><span>And being angry with them he went away:</span></li>
<li><span>The cloud also that was over the tabernacle departed: and
behold Mary appeared white as snow with a leprosy. And when Aaron
had looked on her, and saw her all covered with
leprosy,</span></li>
<li><span>He said to Moses: I beseech thee, my lord, lay not upon
us this sin, which we have foolishly committed:</span></li>
<li><span>Let her not be as one dead, and as an abortive that is
cast forth from the mother's womb. Lo, now one half of her flesh is
consumed with the leprosy.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses cried to the Lord, saying: O God, I beseech
thee heal her.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord answered him: If her father had spitten upon
her face, ought she not to have been ashamed for seven days at
least? Let her be separated seven days without the camp, and after
wards she shall be called again.</span></li>
<li><span>Mary therefore was put out of the camp seven days : and
the people moved not from that place until Mary was called
again.</span></li>

<li><span>And the people marched from Haseroth, and pitched their
tents in the desert of Pharan.</span></li>
<li><span>And there the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Send men to view the land of Chanaan, which I will give
to the children of Israel, one of every tribe, of the
rulers.</span></li>
<li><span>Moses did what the Lord had commanded, sending from the
desert of Pharan, principal men, whose names are these:</span></li>
<li><span>Of the tribe of Ruben, Sammua the son of
Zechur.</span></li>
<li><span>Of the tribe of Simeon, Saphat the son of
Hurl.</span></li>
<li><span>Of the tribe of Juda, Caleb the son of
Jephone.</span></li>
<li><span>Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of
Joseph.</span></li>
<li><span>Of the tribe of Ephraim, Osee the son of Nun.</span></li>
<li><span>Of the tribe of Benjamin, Phalti the son of
Raphu.</span></li>
<li><span>Of the tribe of Zabulon, Geddiel the son of
Sodi.</span></li>
<li><span>Of the tribe of Joseph, of the sceptre of Manasses, Gaddi
the son of Susi.</span></li>
<li><span>Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of
Gemalli.</span></li>
<li><span>Of the tribe of Aser, Sthur the son of
Michael.</span></li>
<li><span>Of the tribe of Nephtali, Nahabi the son of
Vapsi.</span></li>
<li><span>Of the tribe of Gad, Guel the son of Machi.</span></li>
<li><span>These are the names of the men, whom Moses sent to view
the land: and he called Osee the son of Nun, Josue.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses sent them to view the land of Chanaan, and said
to them: Go you up by the south side. And when you shall come to
the mountains,</span></li>
<li><span>View the land, of what sort it is: and the people that
are the inhabitants thereof, whether they be strong or weak: few in
number or many:</span></li>
<li><span>The land itself, whether it be good or bad: what manner
of cities, walled or without walls:</span></li>
<li><span>The ground, fat or barren, woody or without trees. Be of
good courage, and bring us of the fruits of the land. Now it was
the time when the first ripe grapes are fit to be
eaten.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they were gone up, they viewed the land from the
desert of Sin, unto Rohob as you enter into Emath.</span></li>
<li><span>And they went up at the south side, and came to Hebron,
where were Achiman and Sisai and Tholmai the sons of Enac. For
Hebron was built seven years before Tanis the city of
Egypt.</span></li>
<li><span>And going forward as far as the torrent of the cluster of
grapes, they cut off a branch with its cluster of grapes, which two
men carried upon a lever. They took also of the pomegranates and of
the figs of that place:</span></li>
<li><span>Which was called Nehelescol, that is to say, the torrent
of the cluster of grapes, because from thence the children of
Israel had carried a cluster of grapes.</span></li>
<li><span>And they that went to spy out the land returned after
forty days, having gone round all the country,</span></li>
<li><span>And came to Moses and Aaron and to all the assembly of
the children of Israel to the desert of Pharan, which is in Cades.
And speaking to them and to all the multitude, they shewed them the
fruits of the land:</span></li>
<li><span>And they related and said: We came into the land to which
thou sentest us, which in very deed floweth with milk and honey as
may be known by these fruits:</span></li>
<li><span>But it hath very strong inhabitants, and the cities are
great and walled. We saw there the race of Enac.</span></li>
<li><span>Amalec dwelleth in the south, the Hethite and the
Jebusite and the Amorrhite in the mountains: but the Chanaanite
abideth by the sea and near the streams of the Jordan.</span></li>
<li><span>In the mean time Caleb, to still the murmuring of the
people that rose against Moses, said: Let us go up and possess the
land, for we shall be able to conquer it.</span></li>
<li><span>But the others, that had been with him, said: No, we are
not able to go up to this people, because they are stronger than
we.</span></li>
<li><span>And they spoke ill of the land, which they had viewed,
before the children of Israel, saying: The land which we have
viewed, devoureth its inhabitants: the people, that we beheld, are
of a tall stature.</span></li>
<li><span>There we saw certain monsters of the sons of Enac, of the
giant kind: in comparison of whom, we seemed like
locusts.</span></li>

night.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and
Aaron, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Would God that we had died in Egypt and would God we may
die in this vast wilderness, and that the Lord may not bring us
into this land, lest we fall by the sword, and our wives and
children be led away captives. Is it not better to return into
Egypt?</span></li>
<li><span>And they said one to another: Let us appoint a captain,
and let us return into Egypt.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Moses and Aaron heard this, they fell down flat
upon the ground before the multitude of the children of
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>But Josue the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephone,
who themselves also had viewed the land, rent their
garments,</span></li>
<li><span>And said to all the multitude of the children of Israel:
The land which we have gone round is very good:</span></li>
<li><span>If the Lord be favourable, he will bring us into it, and
give us a land flowing with milk and honey.</span></li>
<li><span>Be not rebellious against the Lord: and fear ye not the
people of this land, for we are able to eat them up as bread. All
aid is gone from them: the Lord is with us, fear ye
not.</span></li>
<li><span>And when all the multitude cried out, and would have
stoned them, the glory of the Lord appeared over the tabernacle of
the covenant to all the children of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: How long will this people
detract me? how long will they not believe me for all the signs
that I have wrought before them?</span></li>
<li><span>I will strike them therefore with pestilence, and will
consume them: but thee I will make a ruler over a great nation, and
a mightier than this is.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses said to the Lord: That the Egyptians, from the
midst of whom thou hast brought forth this people,</span></li>
<li><span>And the inhabitants of this land, (who have heard that
thou, O Lord, art among this people, and art seen face to face, and
thy cloud protecteth them, and thou goest before them in a pillar
of a cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night,)</span></li>
<li><span>May hear that thou hast killed so great a multitude as it
were one man and may say:</span></li>
<li><span>He could not bring the people into the land for which he
had sworn, therefore did he kill them in the
wilderness.</span></li>
<li><span>Let their the strength of the Lord be magnified, as thou
hast sworn, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord is patient and full of mercy, taking away
iniquity and wickedness, and leaving no man clear, who visitest the
sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
generation.</span></li>
<li><span>Forgive, I beseech thee, the sins of this people,
according to the greatness of thy mercy, as thou hast been merciful
to them from their going out of Egypt unto this place.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said: I have forgiven according to thy
word.</span></li>
<li><span>As I live: and the whole earth shall be filled with the
glory of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>But yet all the men that have seen my majesty, and the
signs that I have done in Egypt, and in the wilderness, and have
tempted me now ten times, and have not obeyed my voice,</span></li>
<li><span>Shall not see the land for which I aware to their
fathers, neither shall any one of them that hath detracted me
behold it.</span></li>
<li><span>My servant Caleb, who being full of another spirit hath
followed me, I will bring into this land which he hath gone round:
and his seed shall possess it.</span></li>
<li><span>For the Amalecite and the Chanaanite dwell in the
valleys. To morrow remove the camp, and return into the wilderness
by the way of the Red Sea.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>How long doth this wicked multitude murmur against me? I
have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Say therefore to them: As I live, saith the Lord:
According as you have spoken in my hearing, so will I do to
you.</span></li>
<li><span>fin the wilderness shall your carcasses lie. All you that
were numbered from twenty years old and upward, and have murmured
against me,</span></li>
<li><span>Shall not enter into the land, over which I lifted up my
bend to make you dwell therein, except Caleb the son of Jephone,
and Josue the son of Nun.</span></li>
<li><span>But your children, of whom you said, that they should be
a prey to the enemies, will I bring in: that they may see the land
which you have despised.</span></li>
<li><span>Your carcasses shall lie in the wilderness.</span></li>
<li><span>Your children shall wander in the desert forty years, and
shall bear your fornication, until the carcasses of their fathers
be consumed ill the desert,</span></li>
<li><span>According to the number of the forty days, wherein you
viewed the land: year shall be counted for a day. And forty years
you shall receive your iniquities, and shall know my
revenge:</span></li>
<li><span>For as I have spoken, so will I do to all this wicked
multitude, that hath risen up together against me: in this
wilderness shall it faint away and die.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore all the men, whom Moses had sent to view the
land, and who at their return had made the whole multitude to
murmur against him, speaking ill of the land that it was
naught,</span></li>
<li><span>Died and were struck in the sight of the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>But Josue .the son of Nun. and Caleb the son of Jephone
lived, of all them that had gone to view the land.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses spoke all these words to all the children of
Israel, and the people mourned exceedingly.</span></li>
<li><span>And behold rising up very early in the morning, they went
up to the top of the mountain, and said: We are ready to go up to
the place, of which the Lord hath spoken: for we have
sinned.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses said to them: Why transgress you the word of
the Lord, which shall not succeed prosperously with
you?</span></li>
<li><span>Go not up, for the Lord is not with you: lest you fall
before your enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>The Amalecite and the Chanaanite are before you, and by
their sword you shall fall, because you would not consent to the
Lord, neither will the Lord be with you.</span></li>
<li><span>But they being blinded went up to the top of the
mountain. But the ark of the testament of the Lord and Moses
departed not from the camp.</span></li>

<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="15">Numbers 15</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Speak to the children of Israel and thou shalt say to
them: When you shall be come into the land of your habitation,
which I will give you,</span></li>
<li><span>And shall make an offering to the Lord, for a holocaust,
or a victim, paying your vows, or voluntarily offering gifts, or in
your solemnities burning a sweet savour unto the Lord, of oxen or
of sheep:</span></li>
<li><span>Whosoever immolateth the victim, shall offer a sacrifice
of fine flour, the tenth part of an ephi, tempered with the fourth
part of a hin of oil:</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall give the same measure of wine to pour out in
libations for the holocaust or for the victim. For every
lamb,</span></li>
<li><span>And for every ram there shall be a sacrifice of hour of
two tenths, which shall be tempered with the third part of a hin of
oil:</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall offer the third part of the same measure of
wine for the libation, for a sweet savour to the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>But when thou offerest a holocaust or sacrifice of oxen,
to fulfil thy vow or for victims of peace offerings,</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt give for every ox three tenths of flour
tempered with half a hin of oil,</span></li>
<li><span>And wine for libations of the same measure, for an
offering of most sweet savour to the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus shalt thou do</span></li>
<li><span>For every ox and ram and lamb and kid.</span></li>
<li><span>Both they that are born in the land, and the
strangers</span></li>
<li><span>Shall offer sacrifices after the same rite.</span></li>
<li><span>There shall be all one law and judgment both for you and
for them who are strangers in the land.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to
them:</span></li>
<li><span>When you are come into the land which I will give
you,</span></li>
<li><span>And shall eat of the bread of that country, you shall
separate firstfruits to the Lord,</span></li>
<li><span>Of the things you eat. As you separate firstfruits of
your barnfloors:</span></li>
<li><span>So also shall you give firstfruits of your dough to the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And if through ignorance you omit any of these things,
which the Lord hath spoken to Moses,</span></li>
<li><span>And by him hath commanded you, from the day that he began
to command and thenceforward,</span></li>
<li><span>And the multitude have forgotten to do it: they shall
offer a calf out of the herd, a holocaust for a most sweet savour
to the Lord, and the sacrifice and libations thereof, as the
ceremonies require, and a buck goat for sin:</span></li>
<li><span>And the priest shall pray for all the multitude of the
children of Israel: and it shall be forgiven them, because they
sinned ignorantly, offering notwithstanding a burnt offering to the
Lord for themselves and for their sin and their
ignorance:</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall be forgiven all the people of the children
of Israel: and the strangers that sojourn among them: because it is
the fault of all the people through ignorance.</span></li>
<li><span>But if one soul shall sin ignorantly, he shall offer a
she goat of a year old for his sin.</span></li>
<li><span>And the priest shall pray for him, because he sinned
ignorantly before the Lord: and he shall obtain his pardon, and it
shall be forgiven him.</span></li>
<li><span>The same law shall be for all that sin by ignorance,
whether they be natives or strangers.</span></li>
<li><span>But the soul that committeth any thing through pride,
whether he be born in the land or a stranger (because he hath been
rebellious against the Lord) shall be cut off from among his
people:</span></li>
<li><span>For he hath contemned the word the Lord, and made void
his precept: therefore shall he be destroyed, and shall bear his
iniquity.</span></li>
<li><span>And it came to pass, when the children of Israel were in
the wilderness, and had found a man gathering sticks on the sabbath
day,</span></li>
<li><span>That they brought him to Moses and Aaron and the whole
multitude.</span></li>
<li><span>And they put him into prison, not knowing what they
should do with him.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Let that man die, let all the
multitude stone him without the camp.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they had brought him out, they stoned him, and
he died as the Lord had commanded.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord also said to Moses:</span></li>
<li><span>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt tell them
I to make to themselves fringes in the corners of their garments,
putting in them ribands of blue:</span></li>
<li><span>That when they shall see them, they may remember all the
commandments of the Lord, and not follow their own thoughts and
eyes going astray after divers things,</span></li>
<li><span>But rather being mindful of the precepts of the Lord, may
do them and be holy to their Cod.</span></li>
<li><span>I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land
of Egypt, that I might be your God.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="16">Numbers 16</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And behold Core the son of Isaar, the son of Caath, the
son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiron the sons of Eliab, and Hon the
son of Pheleth of the children of Ruben,</span></li>
<li><span>Rose lap against Moses, and with them two hundred and
fifty others of the children of Israel, leading men of the
synagogue, and who in the time of assembly were called by
name.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they had stood up against Moses and Aaron, they
said: Let it be enough for you, that all the multitude consisteth
of holy ones, and the Lord is among them: Why lift you up
yourselves above the people of the Lord?</span></li>
<li><span>When Moses heard this, he fell flat on his
face:</span></li>
<li><span>And speaking to Core and all the multitude, he said: In
the morning the Lord will make known who belong to him, and the
holy he will join to himself: and whom he shall choose, they shall
approach to him.</span></li>
<li><span>Do this therefore: Take every man of you your censers,
thou Core, and all thy company.</span></li>
<li><span>And putting fire in them to morrow, put incense upon it
before the Lord: and whomsoever he shall choose, the same shall be
holy: you take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said again to Core: Hear ye sons of
Levi.</span></li>
<li><span>Is it a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath
spared you from all the people, and joined you to himself, that you
should serve him in the service of the tabernacle, and should stand
before the congregation of the people, and should minister to
him?</span></li>
<li><span>Did he therefore make thee and all thy brethren the sons
of Levi to approach unto him, that you should challenge to
yourselves the priesthood also,</span></li>
<li><span>And that all thy company should stand against the Lord ?
for what is Aaron that you murmur against him?</span></li>
<li><span>Then Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiron the sons of
Eliab. But they answered: We will not come.</span></li>
<li><span>Is it a small matter to thee, that thou hast brought us
out of a land that flowed with milk and honey, to kill us in the
desert, except thou rule also like a lord over us?</span></li>
<li><span>Thou best brought us indeed into a land that floweth with
rivers of milk and honey, and hast given us possessions of fields
and vineyards; wilt thou also pull out our eyes? We will not
come.</span></li>
<li><span>Moses therefore being very angry, raid to the Lord:
Respect not their sacrifices: thou knowest that I have not taken of
them so much as a young ass at any time, nor have injured any of
them.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to Core: Do thou and thy congregation stand
apart before the Lord to morrow, and Aaron apart.</span></li>
<li><span>Take every one of you censers, and put incense upon them,
offering to the Lord two hundred and fifty censers: let Aaron also
hold his censer.</span></li>
<li><span>When they had done this, Moses and Aaron
standing,</span></li>
<li><span>And had drawn up all the multitude against them to the
door of the tabernacle, the glory of the Lord appeared to them
all.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord speaking to Moses and Aaron,
said:</span></li>
<li><span>Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I
may presently destroy them.</span></li>
<li><span>They fell flat on their face, and said: O most mighty,
the God of the spirits of all flesh, for one man's sin shall thy
wrath rage against all?</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Moses:</span></li>
<li><span>Command the whole people to separate themselves from the
tents of Core and Dathan and Abiron.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses arose, and went to Dathan and Abiron: and the
ancients of Israel following him,</span></li>
<li><span>He said to the multitude: Depart from the tents of these
wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be involved in
their sins.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they were departed from their tents round about,
Dathan and Abiron coming out stood in the entry of their pavilions
with their wives and children, and all the people.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses said: By this you shall know that the Lord hath
sent me to do all things that you see, and that I have not forged
them of my own head:</span></li>
<li><span>If these men die the common death of men, and if they be
visited with a plague, wherewith others also are wont to be
visited, the Lord did not send me.</span></li>
<li><span>But if the Lord do a new thing, and the earth opening her
mouth swallow them down, and all things that belong to them, and
they go down alive into hell, you shall know that they have
blasphemed the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And immediately as he had made an end of speaking, the
earth broke asunder under their feet:</span></li>
<li><span>And opening her mouth, devoured them with their tents and
all their substance.</span></li>
<li><span>And they went down alive into hell the ground closing
upon them, and they perished from among the people.</span></li>
<li><span>But all Israel, that was standing round about, fled at
the cry of them that were perishing: saying: Lest perhaps the earth
swallow us up also.</span></li>
<li><span>And a fire coming out from the Lord, destroyed the two
hundred and fifty men that offered the incense.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Command Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest to take up
the censers that lie in the burning, and to scatter the fire of one
side and the other: because they are sanctified</span></li>
<li><span>In the deaths of the sinners: and let him beat them into
plates, and fasten them to the altar, because incense hath been
offered in them to the Lord, and they are sanctified, that the
children of Israel may see them for a sign and a
memorial.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, wherein
they had offered, whom the burning fire had devoured, and beat them
into plates, fastening them to the altar:</span></li>
<li><span>That the children of Israel might have for the time to
come wherewith they should be admonished, that no stranger or any
one that is not of seed of Aaron should come near to offer incense
to the Lord, lest he should suffer as Core suffered, and all his
congregation, according as the Lord spoke to Moses.</span></li>
<li><span>The following day all the multitude of the children of
Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron, saying: You have killed
the people of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And when there arose a sedition, and the tumult
increased,</span></li>
<li><span>Moses and Aaron fled to the tabernacle of the covenant.
And when the were gone into it, the cloud covered it, and the glory
of the Lord appeared.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Moses:</span></li>
<li><span>Get you out from the midst of this multitude, this moment
will I destroy them. And as they were lying on the
ground,</span></li>
<li><span>Moses said to Aaron: Take the censer, and putting fire in
it from the altar, put incense upon it, and go quickly to the
people to pray for them: for already wrath is gone out from the
Lord, and the plague rageth.</span></li>
<li><span>When Aaron had done this, and had run to the midst of the
multitude which the burning fire was now destroying, he offered the
incense:</span></li>
<li><span>And standing between the dead and the living, he prayed
for the people, and the plague ceased.</span></li>
<li><span>And the number of them that were slain was fourteen
thousand and seven hundred men, besides them that had perished in
the sedition of Core.</span></li>
<li><span>And Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the tabernacle
of the covenant after the destruction was over.</span></li>

<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Speak to the children of Israel, and take of every one of
them a rod by their kindreds, of all the princes of the tribes,
twelve rods, and write the name of every man upon his
rod.</span></li>
<li><span>And the name of Aaron shall be for the tribe of Levi, and
one rod shall contain all their families:</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the
covenant before the testimony, where I will speak to
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Whomsoever of these I shall choose, his rod shall
blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the
children of Israel, wherewith they murmur against you.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses spoke to the children of Israel: and all the
princes gave him rods one for every tribe: and there were twelve
rods besides the rod of Aaron.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Moses had laid them up before the Lord in the
tabernacle of the testimony:</span></li>
<li><span>He returned on the following day, and found that the rod
of Aaron for the house of Levi, was budded: and that the buds
swelling it had bloomed blossoms, which spreading the leaves, were
formed into almonds.</span></li>
<li><span>Moses therefore brought out all the rods from before the
Lord to all the children of Israel: and they saw, and every one
received their rods.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Carry back the rod of Aaron
into the tabernacle of the testimony, that it may be kept there for
a token of the rebellious children of Israel, and that their
complaints may cease from me lest they die.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses did as the Lord had commanded.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Israel said to Moses: Behold we are
consumed, we all perish.</span></li>
<li><span>Whosoever approacheth to the tabernacle of the Lord, he
dieth. Are we all to a man to be utterly destroyed?</span></li>

<li><span>And the Lord said to Aaron: Thou, and thy sons, and thy
father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary:
and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the sins of your
priesthood.</span></li>
<li><span>And take with thee thy brethren also of the tribe of
Levi, and the sceptre of thy father, and let them be ready in hand,
and minister to thee: but thou and thy sons shall minister in the
tabernacle of the testimony.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Levites shall watch to do thy commands, and about
all the works of the tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the
vessels of the sanctuary nor the altar, lest both they die, and you
also perish with them.</span></li>
<li><span>But let them be with thee, and watch in the charge of the
tabernacle, and in all the ceremonies thereof. A stranger shall not
join himself with you.</span></li>
<li><span>Watch ye in the charge of the sanctuary, and in the
ministry of the altar: lest indignation rise upon the children of
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>I have given you your brethren the Levites from among the
children of Israel, and have delivered them for a gift to the Lord,
to serve in the ministries of the tabernacle.</span></li>
<li><span>But thou and thy sons look ye to the priesthood: and all
things that pertain to the service of the altar, and that are
within the veil, shall be executed by the priests. If any stranger
shall approach, he shall be slain.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Aaron: Behold I have given thee the
charge of my firstfruits. All things that are sanctified by the
children of Israel, I have delivered to thee and to thy sons for
the priestly office, by everlasting ordinances.</span></li>
<li><span>These therefore shalt thou take of the things that are
sanctified, and are offered to the Lord. Every offering, and
sacrifice, and whatsoever is rendered to me for sin and for
trespass, and becometh holy of holies, shall be for thee and thy
sons.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt eat it in the sanctuary: the males only shall
eat thereof, because it is a consecrated thing to thee.</span></li>
<li><span>But the firstfruits, which the children of Israel shall
vow and offer, I have given to thee, and to thy sons, and to thy
daughters, by a perpetual law. He that is clean in thy house, shall
eat them.</span></li>
<li><span>All the best of the oil, and of the wine, and of the
corn, whatsoever firstfruits they offer to the Lord, I have given
them to thee.</span></li>
<li><span>All the firstripe of the fruits, that the ground bringeth
forth, and which are brought to the Lord, shall be for thy use: he
that is clean in thy house, shall eat them.</span></li>
<li><span>Every thing that the children of Israel shall give by
vow, shall be thine.</span></li>
<li><span>Whatsoever is firstborn of all flesh, which they offer to
the Lord, whether it be of men, or of beasts, shall belong to thee:
only for the firstborn of man thou shalt take a price, and every
beast that is unclean thou shalt cause to be redeemed,</span></li>
<li><span>And the redemption of it shall be after one month, for
five sicles of silver, by the weight of the sanctuary. A sicle hath
twenty obols.</span></li>
<li><span>But the firstling of a cow and of a sheep and of a goat
thou shalt not cause to be redeemed, because they are sanctified to
the Lord. Their blood only thou shalt pour upon the altar, and
their fat thou shalt burn for a most sweet odour to the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>But the flesh shall fall to thy use, as the consecrated
breast, and the right shoulder shall be thine.</span></li>
<li><span>All the firstfruits of the sanctuary which the children
of Israel offer to the Lord, I have given to thee and to thy sons
and daughters, by a perpetual ordinance. It is a covenant of salt
for ever before the Lord, to thee and to thy sons.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Aaron: You shall possess nothing in
their land, neither shall you have a portion among them: I am thy
portion and inheritance in the midst of the children of
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And I have given to the sons of Levi all the tithes of
Israel for a possession for the ministry wherewith they serve me in
the tabernacle of the covenant:</span></li>
<li><span>That the children of Israel may not approach any more to
the tabernacle, nor commit deadly sin,</span></li>
<li><span>But only the sons of Levi may serve me in the tabernacle,
and bear the sins of the people. It shall be an everlasting
ordinance in your generations. They shall not possess any other
thing,</span></li>
<li><span>But be content with the oblation or tithes, which I have
separated for their uses and necessities.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Command the Levites, and declare unto them: When you
shall receive of the children of Israel the tithes, which I have
given you, offer the firstfruits of them to the Lord, that is to
say, the tenth part of the tenth:</span></li>
<li><span>That it may be reckoned to you as an oblation of
firstfruits, as well of the barnfloors as of the
winepresses:</span></li>
<li><span>And of all the things of which you receive tithes, offer
the firstfruits to the Lord, and give them to Aaron the
priest.</span></li>
<li><span>All the things that you shall offer of the tithes, and
shall separate for the gifts of the Lord, shall be the best and
choicest things.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt say to them: If you offer all the goodly
and the better things of the tithes, it shall be reckoned to you as
if you had given the firstfruits of the barnfloor and the
winepress:</span></li>
<li><span>And you shall eat them in all your places, both you and
your families: because it is your reward for the ministry,
wherewith you serve in the tabernacle of the testimony.</span></li>

choicest and fat things to yourselves, lest you profane the
oblations of the children of Israel, and die.</span></li>

<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>This is the observance of the victim, which the Lord hath
ordained. Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee
a red cow of full age, in which there is no blemish, and which hath
not carried the yoke:</span></li>
<li><span>And you shall deliver her to Eleazar the priest, who
shall bring her forth without the camp, and shall immolate her in
the sight of all:</span></li>
<li><span>And dipping his finger in her blood, shall sprinkle it
over against the door of the tabernacle seven times,</span></li>

the fire her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, and her
dung.</span></li>
<li><span>The priest shall also take cedar wood, and hyssop, and
scarlet twice dyed, and cast it into the flame, with which the cow
is consumed.</span></li>

enter into the camp, and shall be unclean until the
evening.</span></li>
<li><span>He also that hath burned her, shall wash his garments,

<li><span>And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the
cow, and shall pour them forth without the camp in a most clean
place, that they may be reserved for the multitude of the children
of Israel, and for a water of aspersion: because the cow was burnt
for sin.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he that carried the ashes of the cow, hath
washed his garments, he shall be unclean until the evening. The
children of Israel, and the strangers that dwell among them, shall
observe this for a holy thing by a perpetual ordinance.</span></li>
<li><span>He that toucheth the corpse of a man, and is therefore
unclean seven days,</span></li>
<li><span>Shall be sprinkled with this water on the third day, and
on the seventh, and so shall be cleansed. If he were not sprinkled
on the third day, he cannot be cleansed on the seventh.</span></li>
<li><span>Every one that toucheth the corpse of a man, and is not
sprinkled with mixture, shall profane the tabernacle of the Lord,
and shall perish out of Israel: because he was not sprinkled with
the water of expiation, he shall be unclean, and his uncleanness
shall remain upon him.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the law of a mall that dieth in a tent: All that
go into his tent and all the vessels that are there, shall be
unclean seven days.</span></li>
<li><span>The vessel that hath no cover, nor binding over it, shall
be unclean.</span></li>
<li><span>If any man in the field touch the corpse of a man that
was slain, or that died of himself, or his bone, or his grave, he
shall be unclean seven days.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall take of the ashes of the burning and of
the sin offering, and shall pour living waters upon them into a
vessel.</span></li>
<li><span>And a man that is clean shall dip hyssop in them, and
shall sprinkle therewith all the tent, and all the furniture, and
the men that are defiled with touching any such thing:</span></li>
<li><span>And in this manner he that is clean shall purify the
unclean on the third and on the seventh day. And being expiated the
seventh day, he shall wash both himself and his garments, and be
unclean until the evening.</span></li>
<li><span>If any man be not expiated after this rite, his soul
shall perish out of the midst of the church: because he hath
profaned the sanctuary of the Lord, and was not sprinkled with the
water of purification.</span></li>
<li><span>This precept shall be an ordinance for ever. He also that
sprinkled the water, shall wash his garments. Every one that shall
touch the waters of expiation, shall be unclean until the

<li><span>And the children of Israel, and all the multitude came
into the desert of Sin, in the first month: and the people abode in
Cades. And Mary died there, and was buried in the same
place.</span></li>
<li><span>And the people wanting water, came together against Moses
and Aaron:</span></li>
<li><span>And making a sedition, they said: Would God we had
perished among our brethren before the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Why have you brought out the church of the Lord into the
wilderness, that both we and our cattle should die?</span></li>
<li><span>Why have you made us come up out of Egypt, and have
brought us into this wretched place which cannot be sowed, nor
bringeth forth figs, nor vines, nor pomegranates, neither is there
any water to drink?</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses and Aaron leaving the multitude, went into the
tabernacle of the covenant, and fell flat upon the ground, and
cried to the Lord, and said: O Lord God, hear the cry of this
people, and open to them thy treasure, a fountain of living water,
that being satisfied, they may cease to murmur. And the glory of
the Lord appeared over them.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Take the rod, and assemble the people together, thou and
Aaron thy brother, and speak to the rock before them, and it shall
yield waters. And when thou hast brought forth water out of the
rock, all the multitude and their cattle shall drink.</span></li>
<li><span>Moses therefore took the rod, which was before the Lord,
as he had commanded him,</span></li>
<li><span>And having gathered together the multitude before the
rock, he said to them: Hear, ye rebellious and incredulous: Can we
bring you forth water out of this rock?</span></li>
<li><span>And when Moses had lifted up his hand, and struck the
rook twice with the rod, there came forth water in great abundance,
so that the people and their cattle drank,</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron: Because you have
not believed me, to sanctify me before the children of Israel, you
shall not bring these people into the land, which I will give
them.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the Water of contradiction, where the children of
Israel strove with words against the Lord, and he was sanctified in
them.</span></li>
<li><span>In the mean time Moses sent messengers from Cades to the
king of Edom, to say: Thus saith thy brother Israel: Thou knowest
all the labour that hath come upon us:</span></li>
<li><span>In what manner our fathers went down into Egypt, and
there we dwelt a long time, and the Egyptians afflicted us and our
fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>And how we cried to the Lord, and he heard us, and sent
an angel, who hath brought us out of Egypt. Lo, we are now in the
city of Cades, which is in the uttermost of thy
borders,</span></li>
<li><span>And we beseech thee that we may have leave to pass
through thy country. We will not go through the fields, nor through
the vineyards, we will not drink the waters of thy wells, but we
will go by the common highway, neither turning aside to the right
hand, nor to the left, till we are past thy borders.</span></li>
<li><span>And Edom answered them: Thou shalt not pass by me: if
thou dost I will come out armed against thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Israel said: We will go by the beaten
way: and if we and our cattle drink of thy waters, we will give
thee what is just: there shall be no difficulty in the price, only
let us pass speedily.</span></li>
<li><span>But he answered: Thou shalt not pass. And immediately he
came forth to meet them with an infinite multitude, and a strong
hand,</span></li>
<li><span>Neither would he condescend to their desire to grant them
passage through his borders. Wherefore Israel turned another way
from him.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they had removed the camp from Cades, they came
to mount Her, which is in the borders of the land of
Edom:</span></li>
<li><span>Where the Lord spoke to Moses:</span></li>
<li><span>Let Aaron, saith he, go to his people: for he shall not
go into the land which I have given the children of Israel, because
he was incredulous to my words, at the waters of
contradiction.</span></li>
<li><span>Take Aaron and his son with him, and bring them up into
mount Hor:</span></li>
<li><span>And when thou hast stripped the father of his vesture,
thou shalt vest therewith Eleazar his son: Aaron shall be gathered
to his people, and die there.</span></li>
<li><span>Moses did as the Lord had commanded: and they went up
into mount Hor before all the multitude.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he had stripped Aaron of his vestments, he
vested Eleazar his son with them.</span></li>
<li><span>And Aaron being dead in the top of the mountain, he came
down with Eleazar.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the multitude seeing that Aaron was dead, mourned
for him thirty days throughout all their families.</span></li>

<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="21">Numbers 21</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And when king Arad the Chanaanite, who dwelt towards the
south, had heard this, to wit, that Israel was come by the way of
the spies, he fought against them, and overcoming them carried off
their spoils.</span></li>
<li><span>But Israel binding himself by vow to the Lord, said: It
thou wilt deliver this people into my hand, I will utterly destroy
their cities.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord heard the prayers of Israel, and delivered
up the Chanaanite, and they cut them off and destroyed their
cities: and they called the name of that place Horma, that is to
say, Anathema.</span></li>
<li><span>And they marched from mount Hor, by the way that leadeth
to the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom. And the people began
to be weary of their journey and labour:</span></li>
<li><span>And speaking against God end Moses, they said: Why didst
thou bring us out of Egypt, to die in the wilderness? There is no
bread, nor have we any waters: our soul now loatheth this very
light food.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore the Lord sent among the people fiery serpents,
which bit them and killed many of them.</span></li>
<li><span>Upon which they came to Moses, and said: We have sinned,
because we have spoken against the Lord and thee: pray that he may
take away these serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the
people.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to him: Make brazen serpent, and set it
up for a sign: whosoever being struck shall look on it, shall
live.</span></li>
<li><span>Moses therefore made a brazen serpent, and set it up for
a sign: which when they that were bitten looked upon, they were
healed.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Israel setting forwards camped in
Oboth.</span></li>
<li><span>And departing thence they pitched their tents in
Jeabarim, in the wilderness, that faceth Moab toward the
east.</span></li>
<li><span>And removing from thence, they came to the torrent
Zared:</span></li>
<li><span>Which they left and encamped over against Arnon, which is
in the desert and standeth out on the borders of the Amorrhite. For
Arnon is the border of Moab, dividing the Moabites and the
Amorrhites.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the Lord:
As he did in the Red Sea, so will he do in the streams of
Amen.</span></li>
<li><span>The rocks of the torrents were bowed down that they might
rest in Ar, and lie down in the borders of the
Moabites.</span></li>
<li><span>When they went from that place, the well appeared whereof
the Lord said to Moses: Gather the people together, and I will give
them water.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Israel sung this song: Let the well spring up. They
sung thereto:</span></li>
<li><span>The well, which the princes dug, and the chiefs of the
people prepared by the direction of the lawgiver, and with their
staves. And they marched from the wilderness to
Mathana.</span></li>
<li><span>From Mathana unto Nahaliel: from Nahaliel unto
Bamoth.</span></li>
<li><span>From Bamoth, is a valley in the country of Moab, to the
top of Phasga, which looked towards the desert.</span></li>
<li><span>And Israel sent messengers to Sehon king of the
Amorrhites, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>I beseech thee that I may have leave to pass through thy
land: we will not go aside into the fields or the vineyards, we
will not drink waters of the wells, we will go the king's highway,
till we be past thy borders.</span></li>
<li><span>And he would not grant that Israel should pass by his
borders: but rather gathering an army, went forth to meet them in
the desert, and came to Jasa, and fought against them.</span></li>
<li><span>And he was slain by them with the edge of the sword, and
they possessed his land from the Arnon unto the Jeboc, and to the
confines of the children of Ammon: for the borders of the
Ammonites, were kept with a strong garrison.</span></li>
<li><span>So Israel took all his cities, and dwelt in the cities of
the Amorrhite, to wit, in Hesebon, and in the villages
thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>Hesebon was the city of Sehon the king of the Amorrhites,
who fought against the king of Moab: and took all the land, that
had been of his dominions, as far as the Arnon.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore it is said in the proverb: Come into Hesebon,
let the city of Sehon be built and set up:</span></li>
<li><span>A fire is gone out of Hesebon, a flame from the city of
Sehon, and hath consumed Ar of the Moabites, and the inhabitants of
the high places of the Arnon.</span></li>
<li><span>Woe to thee Moab: thou art undone, O people of Chamos. He
hath given his sons to flight, and his daughters into captivity to
Sehon the king of the Amorrhites.</span></li>
<li><span>Their yoke is perished from Hesebon unto Dibon, they came
weary to Nophe, and unto Medaba.</span></li>
<li><span>So Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorrhite.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses sent some to take a view of Jazer: and they
took the villages of it, and conquered the inhabitants.</span></li>
<li><span>And they turned themselves, and went up by the way of
Basan, and Og the king of Basan came against them with all his
people, to fight in Edrai.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Fear him not, for I have
delivered him and all his people, and his country into thy hand:
and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Sehon the king of the
Amorrhites, the inhabitant of Hesebon.</span></li>
<li><span>So they slew him also with his sons, and all his people,
not letting any one escape, and they possessed his
land.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>And they went forward and encamped in the plains of Moab,
over against where Jericho is situate beyond the
Jordan.</span></li>
<li><span>And Balac the son of Sephor, seeing all that Israel had
done to the Amorrhite,</span></li>
<li><span>And that the Moabites were in great fear of him, and were
not able to sustain his assault,</span></li>
<li><span>He said to the elders of Madian: So will this people
destroy all that dwell in our borders, as the ox is wont to eat the
grass to the very roots. Now he was at that time king in
Moab.</span></li>
<li><span>He sent therefore messengers to Balaam the son of Beer, a
soothsayer, who dwelt by the river of the land of the children of
Ammon, to call him, and to say: Behold a people is come out of
Egypt, that hath covered the face of the earth, sitting over
against me.</span></li>
<li><span>Come therefore, and curse this people, because it is
mightier than I: if by any means I may beat them and drive them out
of my land: for I know that he whom thou shalt bless is blessed,
and he whom thou shalt curse is cursed.</span></li>
<li><span>And the ancients of Moab, and the elders of Madian, went
with the price of divination in their hands. And when they were
come to Balaam, and had told him all the words of
Balac:</span></li>
<li><span>He answered: Tarry here this night, and I will answer
whatsoever the Lord shall say to me. And while they stayed with
Balaam, God came and said to him:</span></li>
<li><span>What mean these men that are with thee?</span></li>
<li><span>He answered: Balac the son of Sephor king of the Moabites
hath sent to me,</span></li>
<li><span>Saying: Behold a people that is come out of Egypt, hath
covered the face of the land: come and curse them, if by any means
I may fight with them and drive them away.</span></li>
<li><span>And God said to Balaam : Thou shalt not go with them, nor
shalt thou curse the people: because it is blessed.</span></li>
<li><span>And he rose in the morning and said to the princes: Go
into your country, because the Lord hath forbid me to come with
you.</span></li>
<li><span>The princes returning, said to Balac: Balaam would not
come with us.</span></li>
<li><span>Then he sent many more and more noble than he had sent
before:</span></li>
<li><span>Who, when they were come to Balaam, said: Thus saith
Balac the son of Sephor, Delay not to come to me:</span></li>
<li><span>For I am ready to honour thee, and will give thee
whatsoever thou wilt: come and curse this people.</span></li>
<li><span>Balaam answered: If Balac would give me his house full of
silver and gold, I cannot alter the word of the Lord my God, to
speak either more or less.</span></li>
<li><span>I pray you to stay here this night also, that I may know
what the Lord will answer me once more.</span></li>
<li><span>God therefore came to Balaam in the night, and said to
him: It these men be come to call thee, arise and go with them: yet
so, that thou do what I shall command thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Balaam arose in the morning, and saddling his ass went
with them.</span></li>
<li><span>And God was angry. And an angel of the Lord stood in the
way against Balaam, who sat on the ass, and had two servants with
him.</span></li>
<li><span>The ass seeing the angel standing in the way, with a
drawn sword, turned herself out of the way, and went into the
field. And when Balaam beat her, and had a mind to bring her again
to the way,</span></li>
<li><span>The angel stood in a narrow place between two walls,
wherewith the vineyards were enclosed.</span></li>
<li><span>And the ass seeing him, thrust herself close to the wall,
and bruised the foot of the rider. But he beat her
again:</span></li>
<li><span>And nevertheless the angel going on to a narrow place,
where there was no way to turn aside either to the right hand or to
the left, stood to meet him.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the ass saw the angel standing, she fell under
the feet of the rider: who being angry beat her sides more
vehemently with a staff.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord opened the mouth of the ass, and she said:
What have I done to thee? Why strikest thou me, lo, now this third
time?</span></li>
<li><span>Balaam answered: Because thou hast deserved it, and hast
served me ill: I would I had a sword that I might kill
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>The ass said: Am not I thy beast, on which thou hast been
always accustomed to ride until this present day? tell me if I ever
did the like thing to thee. But he said: Never.</span></li>
<li><span>Forthwith the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw
the angel standing in the way with a drawn sword, and he worshipped
him falling flat on the ground.</span></li>
<li><span>And the angel said to him: Why beatest thou thy ass these
three times? I am come to withstand thee, because thy way is
perverse, and contrary to me:</span></li>
<li><span>And unless the ass had turned out of the way, giving
place to me who stood against thee, I had slain thee, and she
should have lived.</span></li>
<li><span>Balaam said: I have sinned, not knowing that thou didst
stand against me: and now if it displease thee that I go, I will
return.</span></li>
<li><span>The angel said: Go with these men, and see thou speak no
other thing than what I shall command thee. He went therefore with
the princes.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Balac heard it he came forth to meet him in a
town of the Moabites, that is situate in the uttermost borders of
Arnon.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to Balaam: I sent messengers to call thee,
why didst thou not come immediately to me? was it because I am not
able to reward thy coming?</span></li>
<li><span>He answered him: Lo, here I am: shall I have power to
speak any other thing but that which God shall put in my
mouth?</span></li>
<li><span>So they went on together, and came into a city, that was
in the uttermost borders of his kingdom.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Balac had killed oxen and sheep, he sent
presents to Balaam, and to the princes that were with
him.</span></li>
<li><span>And when morning was come, he brought him to the high
places of Baal, and he beheld the uttermost part of the
people.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="23">Numbers 23</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And Balaam said to Balac: Build me here seven altars, and
prepare as many calves, and the same number of rams.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he had done according to the word of Balaam,
they laid together a calf and a ram upon every altar.</span></li>
<li><span>And Balaam said to Balac: Stand a while by thy burnt
offering, until I go, to see if perhaps the Lord will meet me, and
whatsoever he shall command, I will speak to thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he was gone with speed, God met him. And Balaam
speaking to him, said: I have erected seven altars, and have laid
on everyone a calf and a ram.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord put the word in his mouth, and said: Return
to Balac, and thus shalt thou speak.</span></li>
<li><span>Returning he found Balac standing by his burnt offering,
with all the princes of the Moabites:</span></li>
<li><span>And taking up his parable, he said: Balac king of the
Moabites hath brought me from Aram, from the mountains of the east:
Come, said he, and curse Jacob: make haste and detest
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>How shall I curse him, whom God hath not cursed? By what
means should I detest him, whom the Lord detesteth not?</span></li>
<li><span>I shall see him from the tops of the rocks, and shall
consider him from the hills. This people shall dwell alone, and
shall not be reckoned among the nations.</span></li>
<li><span>Who can count the dust of Jacob, and know the number of
the stock of Israel? Let my soul die the death of the just, and my
last end be like to them.</span></li>
<li><span>And Balac said to Balaam: What is this that thou dost? I
sent for thee to curse my enemies: and thou contrariwise blessest
them.</span></li>
<li><span>He answered him: Call I speak any thing else but what the
Lord commandeth?</span></li>
<li><span>Balac therefore said: Come with me to another place from
whence thou mayest see part of Israel, and canst not see them all:
curse them from thence.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he had brought him to a high place, upon the top
of mount Phasga, Balaam built seven altars, and laying on every one
a calf and a ram,</span></li>
<li><span>He said to Balac: Stand here by thy burnt offering while
I go to meet him.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the Lord had met him, and had put the word in
his mouth, he said: Return to Balac, and thus shalt thou say to
him.</span></li>
<li><span>Returning he found him standing by his burnt sacrifice,
and the princes of the Moabites with him. And Balac said to him:
What hath the Lord spoken?</span></li>
<li><span>But he taking up his parable, said: Stand, O Balac, and
give ear: hear, thou son of Sephor:</span></li>
<li><span>God is not a man, that he should lie, nor as the son of
man, that he should be changed. Hath he said then, and will he not
do? hath he spoken, and will he not fulfil?</span></li>
<li><span>I was brought to bless, the blessing I am not able to
hinder.</span></li>
<li><span>There is no idol in Jacob, neither is there an image god
to be seen in Israel. The Lord his God is with him, and the sound
of the victory of the king in him.</span></li>
<li><span>God hath brought him out of Egypt, whose strength is like
to the rhinoceros.</span></li>
<li><span>There is no soothsaying in Jacob, nor divination in
Israel. In their times it shall be told to Jacob and to Israel what
God hath wrought.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold the people shall rise up as a lioness, and shall
lift itself up as a lion: it shall not lie down till it devour the
prey, and drink the blood of the slain.</span></li>
<li><span>And Balac said to Balaam: Neither curse, nor bless
him.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said: Did I not tell thee, that whatsoever God
should command me, that I would do?</span></li>
<li><span>And Balac said to him: Come and I will bring thee to
another place; if peradventure it please God that thou mayest curse
them from thence.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he had brought him upon the top of mount Phogor,
which looketh towards the wilderness,</span></li>
<li><span>Balaam said to him: Build me here seven altars, and
prepare as many calves, and the same number of rams.</span></li>
<li><span>Balac did as Balaam had said: and he laid on every altar,
a calf and a ram.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="24">Numbers 24</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord that he
should bless Israel. he went not as he had gone before, to seek
divination: but setting his face towards the desert,</span></li>
<li><span>And lifting up his eyes, he saw Israel abiding in their
tents by their tribes: and the spirit of God rushing upon
him,</span></li>
<li><span>He took up his parable and said: Balaam the son of Beor
hath said: The man hath said, whose eye ire stopped up:</span></li>
<li><span>The hearer of the words of God hath said, he that hath
beheld the vision of the Almighty, he that falleth, and so his eyes
are opened:</span></li>
<li><span>How beautiful are thy tabernacles, O Jacob, and thy
tents, O Israel!</span></li>
<li><span>As woody valleys, as watered gardens near the rivers, as
tabernacles which the Lord hath pitched, as cedars by the
waterside.</span></li>
<li><span>Water shall flow out of his bucket, and his seed shall be
in many waters. For Agag his king shall be removed, and his kingdom
shall be taken awry.</span></li>
<li><span>God hath brought him out of Egypt, whose strength is like
to the rhinoceros. They shall devour the nations that are his
enemies, and break their bones, and pierce them with
arrows.</span></li>
<li><span>Lying down he hath slept as a lion, and as a lioness,
whom none shall dare to rouse. He that blesseth thee, shall also
himself be blessed: he that curseth thee shall be reckoned
accursed.</span></li>
<li><span>And Balac being angry against Balaam, clapped his hands
together and said: I called thee to curse my enemies, and thou on
the contrary hast blessed them three times.</span></li>
<li><span>Return to thy place. I had determined indeed greatly to
honour thee, but the Lord hath deprived thee of the honour designed
for thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Balaam made answer to Balac: Did I not say to thy
messengers, whom thou sentest to me:</span></li>
<li><span>If Balac would give me his house full of silver and gold,
I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God, to utter any thing
of my own head either good or evil: but whatsoever the Lord shall
say, that I will speak?</span></li>
<li><span>But yet going to my people, I will give thee counsel,
what this people shall do to thy people in the latter
days.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore taking up his parable, again he said: Balaam
the son of Beor hath said: The man whose eye is stopped up, hath
said:</span></li>
<li><span>The hearer of the words of God hath said, who knoweth the
doctrine of the Highest, and seeth the visions of the Almighty, who
falling hath his eyes opened:</span></li>
<li><span>I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not
near. A STAR SHALL RISE out of Jacob and a sceptre shall spring up
from Israel: and shall strike the chiefs of Moab, and shall waste
all the children of Seth.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall possess Idumea: the inheritance of Seir
shall come to their enemies, but Israel shall do
manfully</span></li>
<li><span>Out of Jacob shall he come that shall rule, and shall
destroy the remains of the city.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he saw Amalec, he took up his parable, and said:
Amalec the beginning of nations, whose latter ends shall be
destroyed.</span></li>
<li><span>He saw also the Cinite: and took up his parable, and
said: Thy habitation in- deed is strong: but though thou build thy
nest in a rock,</span></li>
<li><span>And thou be chosen of the stock of Cin, how long shalt
thou be able to continue? For Assur shall take thee
captive.</span></li>
<li><span>And taking up his parable, again he said: Alas, who shall
live when God shall do these things?</span></li>
<li><span>They shall come in galleys from Italy, they shall
overcome the Assyrians, and shall waste the Hebrews, and at the
last they themselves also shall perish.</span></li>
<li><span>And Balaam rose, and returned to his place: Balac also
returned the way that he came.</span></li>

them, and adored their gods.</span></li>

Lord being angry,</span></li>
<li><span>Said to Moses: Take all the princes of the people, and
hang them up on gibbets against the sun: that my fury may be turned
away from Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses said to the judges of Israel: Let every man

all the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the
tabernacle.</span></li>

priest saw it, he rose up from the midst; of the multitude, and
taking a dagger,</span></li>
<li><span>Went in after the Israelite into the brothel house, and
thrust both of them through together, to wit, the man and the woman
in the genital parts. And the scourge ceased from the children of
Israel:</span></li>
<li><span>And there were slain four and twenty thousand
men.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Moses:</span></li>
<li><span>Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest,
hath turned away my wrath from the children of Israel: because he
was moved with my zeal against them, that I myself might not
destroy the children of Israel in my zeal.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore say to him: Behold I give him the peace of my
covenant,</span></li>
<li><span>And the covenant of the priesthood for ever shall be both
to him and his seed, because he hath been zealous for his God, and
hath made atonement for the wickedness of the children of
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And the name of the Israelite, was slain with the woman
of Madian, was Zambri the son of Salu, a prince the kindred and
tribe of Simeon.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Madianite woman, that was slain with him, was
called Cozbi the daughter of Sur, a most noble prince among the
Madianites.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Let the Madianites find you enemies, and slay you
them:</span></li>
<li><span>Because they also have acted like enemies against you,
and have guilefully deceived you by the idol Phogor, and Cozbi
their sister, a daughter of a prince of Madian, who was slain in
the day the plague for the sacrilege of Phogor.</span></li>

Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron, the priest:</span></li>
<li><span>Number the whole sum of the children of Israel from
twenty years old and upward, by their houses and kindreds, all that
are able to go forth to war.</span></li>
<li><span>Moses therefore and Eleazar the priest, being in the
plains of Moab upon the Jordan over against Jericho, spoke to them
that were</span></li>
<li><span>From twenty years old and upward, as the Lord had
commanded: and this is the number of them:</span></li>
<li><span>Ruben the firstborn of Israel. His sons were Henoch, of
whom is the family of the Henochites: and Phallu, of whom is the
family of the Phalluites:</span></li>
<li><span>And Hesron, of whom is the family of the Hesronites: and
Charmi, of whom is the family of the Charmites.</span></li>
<li><span>These are the families of the stock of Ruben: whose
number was found to be forty-three thousand seven hundred and
thirty.</span></li>
<li><span>The son of Phallu was Eliab.</span></li>
<li><span>His sons, were Namuel and Dathan and Abiron. These are
Dathan and Abiron the princes of the people, that rose against
Moses and Aaron in the sedition of Core, when they rebelled against
the Lord:</span></li>
<li><span>And the earth opening her mouth swallowed up Core, many
others dying, when the fire burned two hundred and fifty men. And
there was a great miracle wrought,</span></li>
<li><span>That when Core perished, his sons did not
perish.</span></li>
<li><span>The sons of Simeon by their kindreds: Namuel, of him is
the family of the Namuelites: Jamin, of him is the family of the
Jaminites: Jachin, of him is the family of the
Jachinites:</span></li>
<li><span>Zare, of him is the family of the Zarites: Saul, of him

<li><span>Then came the daughters of Salphaad, the son of Hepher,
the son of Galaad, the son of Machir, the son of Manasses, who was
the son of Joseph: and their names are Maala, and Noa, and Hegla,
and Melcha, and Thersa.</span></li>
<li><span>And they stood before Moses and Eleazar the priest, and
all the princes of the people at the door of the tabernacle of the
covenant, and said:</span></li>
<li><span>Our father died in the desert, and was not in the
sedition, that was raised against the Lord under Core, but he died
in his own sin: and he had no male children. Why is his name taken
away out of his family, because he had no son? Give us a possession
among the kinsmen of our father.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses referred their cause to the judgment of the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to him:</span></li>
<li><span>The daughters of Salphaad demand a just thing : Give them
a possession among their father's kindred, and let them succeed him
in his inheritance.</span></li>
<li><span>And to the children of Israel thou shalt speak these
things:</span></li>
<li><span>When a man dieth without a son, his inheritance shall
pass to his daughter.</span></li>
<li><span>If he have no daughter, his brethren shall succeed
him.</span></li>
<li><span>And if he have no brethren, you shall give the
inheritance to his father's brethren.</span></li>
<li><span>But if he have no uncles by the father, the inheritance
shall be given to them that are the next akin. And this shall be to
the children of Israel sacred by a perpetual law, as the Lord hath
commanded Moses.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord also said to Moses: Go up into this mountain
Abarim, and view from thence the land which I will give to the
children of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And when thou shalt have seen it, thou also shalt go to
thy people, as thy brother Aaron is gone:</span></li>
<li><span>Because you offended me in the desert of Sin in the
contradiction of the multitude, neither would you sanctify me
before them at the waters. These are the waters of contradiction in
Cades of the desert of Sin.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses answered him:</span></li>
<li><span>May the Lord the God of the spirits of all flesh provide
a man, that may be over this multitude:</span></li>
<li><span>And may go out and in before them, and may lead them out,
or bring them in: lest the people of the Lord be as sheep without a
shepherd.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to him: Take Josue the son of Nun, a
man in whom is the Spirit, and put thy hand upon him.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest and all the
multitude:</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt give him precepts in the sight of all, and
part of thy glory, that all the congregation of the children of
Israel may hear him.</span></li>
<li><span>If any thing be to be done, Eleazar the priest shall
consult the Lord for him. He and all the children of Israel with
him, and the rest of the multitude shall go out and go in at his
word.</span></li>
<li><span>Moses did as the Lord had commanded. And when he had
taken Josue, he set him before Eleazar the priest, and all the
assembly of the people,</span></li>
<li><span>And laying his hands on his head, he repeated all things
that the Lord had commanded.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>And Moses told the children of Israel all that the Lord
had commanded him :</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to the princes of the tribes of the children
of Israel: This is the word that the Lord hath
commanded:</span></li>
<li><span>If any man make a vow to the Lord, or bind himself by an
oath: he shall not make his word void but shall fulfil all that he
promised.</span></li>
<li><span>If a woman vow any thing, and bind herself by an oath,
being in her father's house, and but yet a girl in age: if her
father knew the vow that she hath promised, and the oath wherewith
she hath bound her soul, and held his peace, she shall be bound by
the vow:</span></li>
<li><span>Whatsoever she promised and swore, she shall fulfil in
deed.</span></li>
<li><span>But if her father, immediately as soon as he heard it,
gainsaid it, both her vows and her oaths shall be void, neither
shall she be bound to what she promised, because her father hath
gainsaid it.</span></li>
<li><span>If she have a husband, and shall vow any thing, and the
word once going out of her mouth shall bind her soul by an
oath:</span></li>
<li><span>The day that her husband shall hear it, and not gainsay
it, she shall be bound to the vow, and shall give whatsoever she
promised.</span></li>
<li><span>But if as soon as he heareth he gainsay it, and make her
promises and the words wherewith she had bound her soul of no
effect : the Lord will forgive her.</span></li>
<li><span>The widow, and she that is divorced, shall fulfil
whatsoever they vow.</span></li>
<li><span>If the wife in the house of her husband, hath bound
herself by vow and by oath,</span></li>
<li><span>If her husband hear, and hold his peace, and doth not
disallow the promise, she shall accomplish whatsoever she had
promised.</span></li>
<li><span>But if forthwith he gainsay it, she shall not be bound by
the promise: because her husband gainsaid it, and the Lord will be
merciful to her.</span></li>
<li><span>If she vow and bind herself by oath, to afflict her soul
by fasting, or abstinence from other things, it shall depend on the
will of her husband, whether she shall do it, or not do
it.</span></li>
<li><span>But if the husband hearing it hold his peace, and defer
the declaring his mind till another day: whatsoever she had vowed
and promised, she shall fulfil: because immediately as he heard it,
he held his peace.</span></li>
<li><span>But if he gainsay it after that he knew it, he shall bear
her iniquity.</span></li>
<li><span>These are the laws which the Lord appointed to Moses

<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>

may take the revenge of the Lord on the Madianites.</span></li>
<li><span>Let a thousand men be chosen out of every tribe of Israel
to be sent to the war.</span></li>
<li><span>And they gave a thousand of every tribe, that is to say,
twelve thousand men well appointed for battle.</span></li>

priest, and he delivered to him the holy vessels, and the trumpets
to sound.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they had fought against the Madianites and had
overcome them, they slew all the men.</span></li>
<li><span>And their kings Evi, and Recem, and Sur, and Hur, and
Rebe, five princes of the nation: Balaam also the son of Beer they
killed with the sword.</span></li>
<li><span>And they took their women, and their children captives,
and all their cattle, and all their goods: and all their
possessions they plundered:</span></li>
<li><span>And all their cities, and their villages, and castles,
they burned.</span></li>
<li><span>And they carried away the booty, and all that they had
taken both of men and of beasts.</span></li>
<li><span>And they brought them to Moses, and Eleazar the priest,

the things for use they carried to the camp on the plains of Moab,
beside the Jordan over against Jericho.</span></li>

army, the tribunes, and the centurions that were come from the
battle,</span></li>
<li><span>Said: Why have you saved the women?</span></li>
<li><span>Are not these they, that deceived the children of Israel
by the counsel of Balaam, and made you transgress against the Lord
by the sin of Phogor, for which also the people was
punished?</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore kill all that are of the male sex, even of the
children: and put to death the women, that have carnally known
men.</span></li>
<li><span>But the girls, and all the women that are virgins save
for yourselves:</span></li>
<li><span>And stay without the camp seven days. He that hath killed
a man, or touched one that is killed, shall be purified the third
day and the seventh day.</span></li>
<li><span>And of all the spoil, every garment, or vessel, or any
thing made for use, of the skins, or hair of goats, or of wood,
shall be purified.</span></li>
<li><span>Eleazar also the priest spoke to the men of the army,

which the Lord hath commanded Moses:</span></li>
<li><span>Gold, and silver, and brass, and iron, and lend, and
tin,</span></li>
<li><span>And all that may pass through the fire, shall be purified
by fire, but whatsoever cannot abide the fire, shall be sanctified
with the water of expiation:</span></li>
<li><span>And you shall wash your garments the seventh day, and
being purified, you shall afterwards enter into the
camp.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Moses:</span></li>
<li><span>Take the sum of the things that were taken both of man
and beast, thou and Eleazar the priest and the princes of the
multitude:</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt divide the spoil equally, between them
that fought and went out to the war, and between the rest of the
multitude.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt separate a portion to the Lord from them
that fought and were in the battle, one soul of five hundred as
well of persons as of oxen and asses and sheep.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt give it to Eleazar the priest, because
they are the firstfruits of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Out of the moiety also of the children of Israel thou
shalt take the fiftieth head of persons, and of oxen, and asses,
and sheep, and of all beasts, and thou shalt give them to the
Levites that watch in the charge of the tabernacle of the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses and Eleazar did as the Lord had
commanded.</span></li>
<li><span>And the spoil which the army had taken, was six hundred
seventy-five thousand sheep,</span></li>
<li><span>Seventy-two thousand oxen,</span></li>
<li><span>Sixty-one thousand asses:</span></li>
<li><span>And thirty-two thousand persons of the female sex, that
had not known men.</span></li>
<li><span>And one half was given to them that had been in the
battle, to wit, three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred
sheep:</span></li>
<li><span>Out of which, for the portion of the Lord, were reckoned
six hundred seventy-five sheep.</span></li>
<li><span>And out of the thirty-six thousand oxen, seventy-two
oxen:</span></li>
<li><span>Out of the thirty thousand five hundred asses, sixty-one
asses:</span></li>
<li><span>Out of the sixteen thousand persons, there fell to the
portion of the Lord, thirty-two souls.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses delivered the number of the firstfruits of the
Lord to Eleazar the priest, as had been commanded him,</span></li>
<li><span>Out of the half of the children of Israel, which he had
separated for them that had been in the battle.</span></li>
<li><span>But out of the half that fell to the rest of the
multitude, that is to say, out of the three hundred thirty-seven
thousand five hundred sheep,</span></li>
<li><span>And out of the thirty-six thousand oxen,</span></li>
<li><span>And out of the thirty thousand five hundred
asses,</span></li>
<li><span>And out of the sixteen thousand persons,</span></li>
<li><span>Moses took the fiftieth head, and gave it to the Levites
that watched in the tabernacle of the Lord, as the Lord had
commanded.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the commanders of the army, and the tribunes and
centurions were come to Moses, they said:</span></li>
<li><span>We thy servants have reckoned up the number of the
fighting men, whom we had under our hand, and not so much as one
was wanting.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore we offer as gifts to the Lord what gold every
one of us could find in the booty, in garters and tablets, rings
and bracelets, and chains, that thou mayst pray to the Lord for
us.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses and Eleazar the priest received all the gold in
divers kinds,</span></li>
<li><span>In weight sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty
sicles, from the tribunes and from the centurions.</span></li>
<li><span>For that which every one had taken in the booty was his
own.</span></li>
<li><span>And that which was received they brought into the
tabernacle of the testimony, for a memorial of the children of
Israel before the Lord.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>And the sons of Ruben and Gad had many flocks of cattle,
and their substance in beasts was infinite. And when they saw the
lands of Jazer and Galaad fit for feeding cattle,</span></li>
<li><span>They came to Moses and Eleazar the priest, and the
princes of the multitude, and said:</span></li>
<li><span>Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nemra, Hesebon, and
Eleale, and Saban, and Nebo, and Beon,</span></li>
<li><span>The land, which the Lord hath conquered in the sight of
the children of Israel, is a very fertile soil for the feeding of
beasts: and we thy servants have very much cattle:</span></li>
<li><span>And we pray thee, if we have found favour in thy sight,
that thou give it to us thy servants in possession, and make us not
pass over the Jordan.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses answered them: What, shall your brethren go to
fight, and will you sit here?</span></li>
<li><span>Why do ye overturn the minds of the children of Israel,
that they may not dare to pass into the place which the Lord hath
given them?</span></li>
<li><span>Was it not thus your fathers did, when I sent from
Cadesbarne to view the land?</span></li>
<li><span>And when they were come as far as the valley of the
cluster, having viewed all the country, they overturned the hearts
of the children of Israel, that they should not enter into the
coasts, which the Lord gave them.</span></li>
<li><span>And he swore in his anger, saying:.</span></li>
<li><span>If these men, that came up out of Egypt, from twenty
years old and upward, shall see the land, which I promised with an
oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: because they would not follow
me,</span></li>
<li><span>Except Caleb the son of Jephone the Cenezite, and Josue
the son of Nun: these have fulfilled my will.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord being angry against Israel, led them about
through the desert forty years, until the whole generation, that
had done evil in his sight, was consumed.</span></li>
<li><span>And behold, said he, you are risen up instead of your
fathers, the increase and offspring of sinful men, to augment the
fury of the Lord against Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>For if you will not follow him, he will leave the people
in the wilderness, end you shall be the cause of the destruction of
all.</span></li>
<li><span>But they coming near, said: We will make sheepfolds, and
stalls for our cattle, and strong cities for our children
:</span></li>
<li><span>And we ourselves will go armed and ready for battle
before the children of Israel, until we bring them in unto their
places. Our little ones, and all we have, shall be in walled
cities, for fear of the ambushes of the inhabitants.</span></li>
<li><span>We will not return into our houses until the children of
Israel possess their inheritance:</span></li>
<li><span>Neither will we seek any thing beyond the Jordan, because
we have already our possession on the east side
thereof,</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses said to them: If you do what you promise, go on
well appointed for war before the Lord:</span></li>
<li><span>And let every fighting man pass over the Jordan, until
the Lord overthrow his enemies :</span></li>
<li><span>And all the land be brought under him, then shall you be
blameless before the Lord and before Israel, and you shall obtain
the countries that you desire, before the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>But if you do not what you say, no man can doubt but you
sin against God: and know ye, that your sin shall overtake
you.</span></li>
<li><span>Build therefore cities for your children, and folds and
stalls for your sheep and beasts, and accomplish what you have
promised.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Gad and Ruben said to Moses: We are
thy servants, we will do what my lord commandeth.</span></li>
<li><span>We will leave our children, and our wives and sheep and
cattle, in the cities of Galaad:</span></li>
<li><span>And we thy servants all well appointed will march on to
the war, as thou, my lord, speakest.</span></li>
<li><span>Moses therefore commanded Eleazar the priest, and Josue
the son of Nun, and the princes of the families of all the tribes
of Israel, and said to them:</span></li>
<li><span>If the children of Gad, and the children of Ruben pass
with you over the Jordan, all armed for war before the Lord, and
the land be made subject to you: give them Galaad in
possession.</span></li>
<li><span>But if they will not pass armed with you into the land of
Chanaan, let them receive places to dwell in among you.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Gad, and the children of Ruben
answered: As the Lord hath spoken to his servants, so will we
do:</span></li>
<li><span>We will go armed before the Lord into the land of
Chanaan, and we confess that we have already received our
possession beyond the Jordan.</span></li>
<li><span>Moses therefore gave to the children of Cad and of Ruben,
and to the half tribe of Manasses the son of Joseph, the kingdom of
Sehon king of the Amorrhites, and the kingdom of Og king of Basan,
and their land and the cities thereof round about.</span></li>
<li><span>And the sons of Cad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and
Aroer,</span></li>
<li><span>And Etroth, and Sophan, and Jazer, and
Jegbaa,</span></li>
<li><span>And Bethnemra, and Betharan, fenced cities, and folds for
their cattle.</span></li>
<li><span>But the children of Ruben built Hesebon, and Eleale, and
Cariathaim,</span></li>
<li><span>And Nabo, and Baalmeon (their names being changed) and
Sabama: giving names to the cities which they had
built.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover the children of Machir, the son of Manasses,
went into Galaad, and wasted it, cutting off the Amorrhites, the
inhabitants thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses gave the land of Galaad to Machir the son of
Manasses, and he dwelt in it.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jair the son of Manasses went, and took the villages
thereof, and he called them Havoth Jair, that is to say, the
villages of Jair.</span></li>
<li><span>Nobe also went, and took Canath with the villages
thereof: and he called it by his own name, Nobe.</span></li>

which looketh towards Beelsephon, and they camped before
Magdalum.</span></li>

were twelve fountains of waters, and seventy palm trees: and there
they camped.</span></li>

shall give a larger part, and to the fewer a lesser. To every one
as the lot shall fall, so shall the inheritance be given. The
possession shall be divided by the tribes and the
families.</span></li>

be fallen into your possession by lot, it shall be bounded by these
limits:</span></li>
<li><span>The south side shall begin from the wilderness of Sin,
which is by Edom: and shall have the most salt sea for its furthest
limits eastward:</span></li>
<li><span>Which limits shall go round on the south side by the
ascent of the Scorpion and so into Senna, and reach toward the
south as far as Cadesbarne, from whence the frontiers shall go out
to the town called Adar, and shall reach as far as
Asemona.</span></li>
<li><span>And the limits shall fetch a compass from Asemona to the
torrent of Egypt, and shall end in the shore of the great
sea.</span></li>
<li><span>And the west side shall begin from the great sea, and the
same shall be the end thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>But toward the north side the borders shall begin from
the great sea, reaching to the most high mountain,</span></li>
<li><span>From which they shall come to Emath, as far as the
borders of Sedada:</span></li>

village of Enan. These shall be the borders on the north
side.</span></li>

eastward to the sea of Cenereth,</span></li>
<li><span>And shall reach as far as the Jordan, and at the last
shall be closed in by the most salt sea. This shall be your land
with its borders round about.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying: This
shall be the land which you shall possess by lot, and which the
Lord hath commanded to be given to the nine tribes, and to the half

<li><span>Command the children of Israel that they give to the
Levites out of their possessions,</span></li>
<li><span>Cities to dwell in, and their suburbs round about: that
they may abide in the towns, and the suburbs may be for their
cattle and beasts:</span></li>
<li><span>Which suburbs shall reach from the walls of the cities
outward, a thousand paces on every side:</span></li>
<li><span>Toward the east shall be two thousand cubits: and toward
the south in like manner shall be two thousand cubits: toward the
sea also, which looketh to the west, shall be the same extent: and
the north side shall be bounded with the like limits. And the
cities shall be in the midst, and the suburbs without.</span></li>
<li><span>And among the cities, which you shall give to the
Levites, six shall be separated for refuge to fugitives, that he
who hath shed blood may flee to them: and besides these there shall
be other forty-two cities,</span></li>
<li><span>That is, in all forty-eight with their
suburbs.</span></li>
<li><span>And of these cities which shall be given out of the
possessions of the children of Israel, from them that have more,
more shall be taken: and from them that have less, fewer. Each
shall give towns to the Levites according to the extent of their
inheritance.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord said to Moses:</span></li>
<li><span>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to
them: When you shall have passed over the Jordan into the land of
Chanaan,</span></li>
<li><span>Determine what cities shall be for the refuge of
fugitives, who have shed blood against their will.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the fugitive shall be in them, the kinsman of
him that is slain may not have power to kill him, until he stand
before the multitude, and his cause be judged.</span></li>
<li><span>And of those cities, that are separated for the refuge of
fugitives,</span></li>
<li><span>Three shall be beyond the Jordan, and three in the land
of Chanaan,</span></li>
<li><span>As well for the children of Israel as for strangers and
sojourners, that he may flee to them, who hath shed blood against
his will.</span></li>
<li><span>If any man strike with iron, and he die that was struck :
he shall be guilty of murder, and he himself shall die.</span></li>
<li><span>If he throw a stone, and he that is struck die: he shall
be punished in the same manner.</span></li>
<li><span>If he that is struck with wood die: he shall be revenged
by the blood of him that struck him.</span></li>
<li><span>The kinsman of him that was slain, shall kill the
murderer: as soon as he apprehendeth him, he shall kill
him.</span></li>
<li><span>If through hatred any one push a man, or fling any thing-
at him with ill design:</span></li>
<li><span>Or being his enemy, strike; him with his hand, and he
die: the striker shall be guilty of murder: the kinsman of him that
was slain as soon as he findeth him, shall kill him.</span></li>
<li><span>But if by chance medley, and without hatred,</span></li>
<li><span>And enmity, he do any of these things,</span></li>
<li><span>And this be proved in the hearing of the people, and the
cause be debated between him that struck, and the next of
kin:</span></li>
<li><span>The innocent shall be delivered from the hand of the
revenger, and shall be brought back by sentence into the city, to
which he had fled, and he shall abide there until the death of the
high priest, that is anointed with the holy oil.</span></li>
<li><span>If the murderer be found without the limits of the cities
that are appointed for the banished,</span></li>
<li><span>And be struck by him that is the avenger of blood: he
shall not be guilty that killed him.</span></li>
<li><span>For the fugitive ought to have stayed in the city until

manslayer return to his own country.</span></li>
<li><span>These things shall be perpetual, and for an ordinance in
all your dwellings.</span></li>
<li><span>The murderer shall be punished by witnesses: none shall
be condemned upon the evidence of one man.</span></li>
<li><span>You shall not take money of him that is guilty of blood,
but he shall die forthwith.</span></li>
<li><span>The banished and fugitives before the death of the high
priest may by no means return into their own cities.</span></li>
<li><span>Defile not the land of your habitation, which is stained
with the blood of the innocent: neither can it otherwise be
expiated, but by his blood that hath shed the blood of
another.</span></li>

said:</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord hath commanded thee, my lord, that thou shouldst
divide the land by lot to the children of Israel, and that thou
shouldst give to the daughters of Salphaad our brother the
possession due to their father:</span></li>
<li><span>Now if men of another tribe take them to wives, their
possession will follow them, and being transferred to another
tribe, will be a diminishing of our inheritance.</span></li>
<li><span>And so it shall come to pass, that when the jubilee, that
is, the fiftieth year of remission, is come, the distribution made
by the lots shall be confounded, and the possession of the one
shall pass to the others.</span></li>

spoken rightly.</span></li>
<li><span>And this is the law promulgated by the Lord touching the
daughters of Salphaad: Let them marry to whom they will, only so
that it be to men of their own tribe.</span></li>
<li><span>Lest the possession of the children of Israel be mingled
from tribe to tribe. For all men shall marry wives of their own
tribe and kindred:</span></li>

the inheritance may remain in the families,</span></li>

were married to the sons of their uncle by their father</span></li>
