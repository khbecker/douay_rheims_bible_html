They shall cover all the vessels of the altar together with a covering of violet skins, and shall put in the bars.<li>And when Aaron and his sons have wrapped up the sanctuary and the vessels thereof at the removing of the camp, then shall the sons of Caath enter in to carry the things wrapped up: and they shall not touch the vessels of the sanctuary, lest they die. These are the burdens of the sons of Caath: in the tabernacle of the covenant:<li>And over them shall be Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, to whose charge pertaineth the oil to dress the lamps, and the sweet incense, and the sacrifice, that is always offered, and the oil of unction, and whatsoever pertaineth to the service of the tabernacle, and of all the vessels that are in the sanctuary.<li>And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:<li>Destroy not the people of Caath from the midst of the Levites:<li>But do this to them, that they may live, and not die, by touching the holies of holies. Aaron and his sons shall go in, and they shall appoint every man his work, and shall divide the burdens that every man is to carry.<li>Let not others by any curiosity see the things that are in the sanctuary before they be wrapped up, otherwise they shall die.<li>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:<li>Take the sum of the soils of Gerson also by their houses and families and kindreds.<li>From thirty Sears old and upward, unto fifty years old. Number them all that go in and minister in the tabernacle of the covenant.<li>This is the office of the family of the Gersonites :<li>To carry the curtains of the tabernacle and the roof of the covenant, the other covering, and the violet covering over all, and the hanging that hangeth in the entry of the tabernacle of the covenant,<li>The curtains of the court, and the veil in the entry that is before the tabernacle. All things that pertain to the altar, the cords and the vessels of the ministry,<li>The sons of Gerson shall carry, by the commandment of Aaron and his sons: and each man shall know to what burden he must be assigned.<li>This is the service of the family of the Gersonites in the tabernacle of the covenant, and they shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.<li>Thou shalt reckon up the sons of Merari also by the families and houses of their fathers,<li>From thirty years old and upward, unto fifty years old, all that go in to the office of their ministry, and to the service of the covenant of the testimony.<li>These are their burdens: They shall carry the boards of the tabernacle and the bars thereof, the pillars and their sockets,<li>The pillars also of the court round about, with their sockets and pins and cords. They shall receive by account all the vessels and furniture, and so shall carry them.<li>This is the office of the family of the Merarites, and their ministry in the tabernacle of the covenant: and they shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.<li>So Moses and Aaron and the princes of the synagogue reckoned up the sons of Caath, by their kindreds and the houses of their fathers,<li>From thirty years old and upward, unto fifty years old, all that go in to the ministry of the tabernacle of the covenant:<li>And they were found two thousand seven hundred and fifty.<li>This is the number of the people of Caath that go in to the tabernacle of the covenant: these did Moses and Aaron number according to the word of the Lord by the hand of Moses.<li>The sons of Gerson also were numbered by the kindreds and houses of their fathers,<li>From thirty years old and upward, unto fifty years old, all that go in to minister in the tabernacle of the covenant:<li>And they were found two thousand six hundred and thirty.<li>This is the people of the Gersonites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the word of the Lord.<li>The sons of Merari also were numbered by the kindreds and houses of their fathers,<li>From thirty years old and upward, unto fifty years old, all that go in to fulfil the rites of the tabernacle of the covenant:<li>And they were found three thousand two hundred.<li>This is the number of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron reckoned up according to the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses.<li>All that were reckoned up of the Levites, and whom Moses and Aaron and the princes of Israel took by name, by the kindreds and houses of their fathers,<li>From thirty years old and upward, until fifty years old, that go into the ministry of the tabernacle, and to carry the burdens,<li>Were in all eight thousand five hundred and eighty.<li>Moses reckoned them up according to the word of the Lord, every one according to their office and burdens, as the Lord had commanded him.</ol><h2><a name=5>Numbers 5</a></h2><ol><li>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:<li>Command the children of Israel, that they cast out of the camp every leper, and whosoever hath an issue of seed, or is defiled by the dead:<li>Whether it be man or woman, cast ye them out of the camp, lest they defile it when I shall dwell with you.<li>And the children of Israel did so, and they cast them forth without the camp, as the Lord had spoken to Moses.<li>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:<li>Say to the children of Israel: When a man or woman shall have committed any of all the sins that men are wont to commit, and by negligence shall have transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and offended,<li>They shall confess their sin, and restore the principal itself, and the fifth part over and above, to him against whom they have sinned.<li>But if there be no one to receive it, they shall give it to the Lord, and it shall be the priest's, besides the ram that is offered for expiation, to be an atoning sacrifice.<li>an the firstfruits also, which the children of Israel offer, belong to the priest:<li>And whatsoever is offered into the sanctuary by every one, and is delivered into the hands of the priest, it shall be his.<li>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:<li>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: The man whose wife shall have gone astray, and contemning her husband,<li>Shall have slept with another man, and her husband cannot discover it, but the adultery is secret, and cannot be proved by witnesses, because she was not found in the adultery:<li>If the spirit of jealousy stir up the husband against his wife, who either is defiled, or is charged with false suspicion,<li>He shall bring her to the priest, and shall offer an oblation for her, the tenth part of a measure of barley meal: he shall not pour oil thereon, nor put frank- incense upon it: because it is a sacrifice of jealousy, and an oblation searching out adultery.<li>The priest therefore shall offer it, and set it before the Lord.<li>And he shall take holy water in an earthen vessel, and he shall cast a little earth of the pavement of the tabernacle into it.<li>And when the woman shall stand before the Lord, he shall uncover her head, and shall, put on her hands the sacrifice of remembrance, and the oblation of jealousy: and he himself shall hold the most bitter waters, whereon he hath heaped curses with execration.<li>And he shall adjure her, and shall say: If another man hath not slept with thee, and if thou be not defiled by forsaking thy husband's bed, these most bitter waters, on which I have heaped curses, shall not hurt thee.<li>But if thou hast gone aside from thy husband, and art defiled, and hast lain with another man:<li>These curses shall light upon thee: The Lord make thee a curse, and an example for all among his people: may he make thy thigh to rot, and may thy belly swell and burst asunder.<li>Let the cursed waters enter into thy belly, and may thy womb swell and thy thigh rot. And the woman shall answer, Amen, amen.<li>And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and shall wash them out with the most bitter waters, upon which he hath heaped the curses,<li>And he shall give them her to drink. And when she hath drunk them up,<li>The priest shall take from her hand the sacrifice of jealousy, and shall elevate it before the Lord, and shall put it upon the altar: yet so as first,<li>To take a handful of the sacrifice of that which is offered, and burn it upon the altar: and so give the most bitter waters to the woman to drink.<li>And when she hath drunk them, if she be defiled, and having despised her husband be guilty of adultery, the malediction shall go through her, and her belly swelling, her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse, and an example to all the people.<li>But if she be not defiled, she shall not be hurt, and shall bear children.<li>This is the law of jealousy. If a woman hath gone aside from her husband, and be defiled,<li>And the husband stirred up by the spirit of jealousy bring her before the Lord, and the priest do to her according to all things that are here written:<li>The husband shall be blameless, and she shall bear her iniquity.</ol><h2><a name=6>Numbers 6</a></h2><ol><li>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:<li>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: When a man, or woman, shall make a vow to be sanctified, and will consecrate themselves to the Lord:<li>They shall abstain from wine, and from every thing that may make a man drunk. They shall not drink vinegar of wine, or of any other drink, nor any thing that is pressed out of the grape: nor shall they eat grapes either fresh or dried.<li>All the days that they are consecrated to the Lord by vow: they shall eat nothing that cometh of the vineyard, from the raisin even to the kernel.<li>All the time of his separation no razor shall pass over his head, until the day be fulfilled of his consecration to the Lord. He shall be holy, and shall let the hair of his head grow.<li>All the time of his consecration he shall not go in to any dead,<li>Neither shall he make himself unclean, even for his father, or for his mother, or for his brother, or for his sister, when they die, because the consecration of his God is upon his head.<li>All the days of his separation he shall be holy to the Lord.<li>But if any man die suddenly before him: the head of his consecration shall be defiled: and he shall shave it forthwith on the same day of his purification, and again on the seventh day.<li>And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons to the priest in the entry of the covenant of the testimony.<li>And the priest shall offer one for sin, and the other for a holocaust, and shall pray for him, for that he hath sinned by the dead: and he shall sanctify his head that day :<li>And shall consecrate to the Lord the days of his separation, offering a lamb of one year for sin: yet so that the former days be made void, because his sanctification was profaned.<li>This is the law of consecration.

So long was the tabernacle carried, till they same to the place of setting it up.<li>The sons of Ephraim also moved their camp by their troops, in whose army the prince was Elisama the son of Ammiud.<li>And in the tribe of the sons of Manasses, the prince was Gamaliel the son of Phadassur.<li>And in the tribe of Benjamin, the prince was Abidan the son of Gedeon.<li>The last of all the camp marched the sons of Dan by their troops, in whose army the prince was Ahiezer the son of Ammisaddai.<li>And in the tribe of the sons of Aser, the prince was Phegiel the son of Ochran.<li>And in the tribe of the sons of Nephtali, the prince was Ahira the son of Enan.<li>This was the order of the camps, and marches of the children of Israel by their troops, when they set forward.<li>And Moses said to Hobab the son of Raguel the Madianite, his kinsman: We are going towards the place which the Lord will give us: come with us, that we may do thee good : for the Lord hath promised good things to Israel.<li>But he answered him: I will not go with thee, but I will return to my country, wherein I was born.<li>And he said: Do not leave us: for thou knowest in what places we should encamp in the wilderness, and thou shalt be our guide.<li>And if thou comest with us, we will give thee what is the best of the riches which the Lord shall deliver to us.<li>So they marched from the mount of the Lord three days' journey, and the ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them, for three days providing a place for the camp.<li>The cloud also of the Lord was over them by day when they marched.<li>And when the ark was lifted up, Moses said: Arise, O Lord, and let thy enemies be scattered, and let them that hate thee, flee from before thy face.<li>And when it was set down, he said: Return, O Lord, to the multitude of the host of Israel.</ol><h2><a name=11>Numbers 11</a></h2><ol><li>In the mean time there arose a murmuring of the people against the Lord, as it were repining at their fatigue.

And the wrath of the Lord was exceedingly enkindled: to Moses also the thing seemed insupportable.<li>And he said to the Lord: Why hast thou afflicted thy servant? wherefore do I not find favour before thee? and why hast thou laid the weight of all this people upon me ?<li>Have I conceived all this multitude, or begotten them, that thou shouldst say to me: Carry them in thy bosom as the nurse is wont to carry the little infant, and bear them into the land, for which thou hast sworn to their fathers?<li>Whence should I have flesh to give to so great a multitude? they weep against me, saying: Give us flesh that we may eat.<li>I am not able alone to bear all this people, because it is too heavy for me.<li>But if it seem unto thee otherwise, I beseech thee to kill me, and let me find grace in thy eyes, that I be not afflicted with so great evils.<li>And the Lord said to Moses: Gather unto me seventy men of the ancients of Israel, whom thou knowest to be ancients and masters of the people: and thou shalt bring them to the door of the tabernacle of the covenant, and shalt make them stand there with thee,<li>That I may come down and speak with thee: and I will take of thy spirit, and will give to them, that they may bear with thee the burden of the people, and thou mayest not be burthened alone.<li>And thou shalt say to the people: Be ye sanctified : to morrow you shall eat flesh: for I have heard you say: Who will give us flesh to eat? it was well with us in Egypt. That the Lord may give you flesh, and you may eat:<li>Not for one day, nor two, nor five, nor ten, no nor for twenty.<li>But even for a month of days, till it come out at your nostrils, and become loathsome to you, because you have cast off the Lord, who is in the midst of you, and have wept before him, saying: Why came we out of Egypt?<li>And Moses said: There are six hundred thousand footmen of this people, and sayest thou: I will give them flesh to eat a whole month?<li>Shall then a multitude of sheep and oxen be killed, that it may suffice for their food? or shall the fishes of the sea be gathered together to fill them?<li>And the Lord answered him: Is the hand of the Lord unable? Thou shalt presently see whether my word shall come to pass or no.<li>Moses therefore came, and told the people the words of the Lord, and assembled seventy men of the ancients of Israel, and made them to stand about the tabernacle.<li>And the Lord came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, taking away of the spirit that was in Moses, and giving to the seventy men. And when the spirit had rested on them they prophesied, nor did they cease afterwards.<li>Now there remained in the camp two of the men, of whom one was called Eldad, and the other Medad, upon whom the spirit rested; for they also had been enrolled, but were not gone forth to the tabernacle.<li>And when they prophesied in the camp, there ran a young man, and told Moses, saying: Eldad and Medad prophesy in the camp.<li>Forthwith Josue the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, and chosen out of many, said: My lord Moses forbid them.<li>But he said: Why hast thou emulation for me? O that all the people might prophesy, and that the Lord would give them his spirit!<li>And Moses returned, with the ancients of Israel, into the camp.<li>And a wind going out from the Lord, taking quails up beyond the sea brought them, and cast them into the camp for the space of one day's journey, on every side of the camp round about, and they flew in the air two cubits high above the ground.<li>The people therefore rising up all that day, and night, and the next day, gathered together of quails, he that did least, ten cores: and they dried them round about the camp.<li>As yet the flesh was between their teeth, neither had that kind of meat failed: when behold the wrath of the Lord being provoked against the people, struck them with an exceeding great plague.<li>And that place was called, The graves of lust: for there they buried the people that had lusted. And departing from the graves of lust, they came unto Haseroth, and abode there.</ol><h2><a name=12>Numbers 12</a></h2><ol><li>And Mary and Aaron spoke against Moses, because of his wife the Ethiopian,<li>And they said: Hath the Lord spoken by Moses only? hath he not also spoken to us in like manner?

And when they were come out,<li>The Lord came down in a pillar of the cloud, and stood in the entry of the tabernacle calling to Aaron and Mary. And when they were come,<li>He said to them: Hear my words: if there be among you a prophet of the Lord, I will appear to him in a vision, or I will speak to him in a dream.<li>But it is not so with my servant Moses a who is most faithful in all my house:<li>For I speak to him mouth to mouth: and plainly, and not by riddles and figures doth he see the Lord. Why then were you not afraid to speak ill of my servant Moses?<li>And being angry with them he went away:<li>The cloud also that was over the tabernacle departed: and behold Mary appeared white as snow with a leprosy. And when Aaron had looked on her, and saw her all covered with leprosy,<li>He said to Moses: I beseech thee, my lord, lay not upon us this sin, which we have foolishly committed:<li>Let her not be as one dead, and as an abortive that is cast forth from the mother's womb. Lo, now one half of her flesh is consumed with the leprosy.<li>And Moses cried to the Lord, saying: O God, I beseech thee heal her.<li>And the Lord answered him: If her father had spitten upon her face, ought she not to have been ashamed for seven days at least? Let her be separated seven days without the camp, and after wards she shall be called again.<li>Mary therefore was put out of the camp seven days : and the people moved not from that place until Mary was called again.</ol><h2><a name=13>Numbers 13</a></h2><ol><li>And the people marched from Haseroth, and pitched their tents in the desert of Pharan.<li>And there the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:<li>Send men to view the land of Chanaan, which I will give to the children of Israel, one of every tribe, of the rulers.<li>Moses did what the Lord had commanded, sending from the desert of Pharan, principal men, whose names are these:<li>Of the tribe of Ruben, Sammua the son of Zechur.<li>Of the tribe of Simeon, Saphat the son of Hurl.<li>Of the tribe of Juda, Caleb the son of Jephone.<li>Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.<li>Of the tribe of Ephraim, Osee the son of Nun.<li>Of the tribe of Benjamin, Phalti the son of Raphu.<li>Of the tribe of Zabulon, Geddiel the son of Sodi.<li>Of the tribe of Joseph, of the sceptre of Manasses, Gaddi the son of Susi.<li>Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.<li>Of the tribe of Aser, Sthur the son of Michael.<li>Of the tribe of Nephtali, Nahabi the son of Vapsi.<li>Of the tribe of Gad, Guel the son of Machi.<li>These are the names of the men, whom Moses sent to view the land: and he called Osee the son of Nun, Josue.<li>And Moses sent them to view the land of Chanaan, and said to them: Go you up by the south side.

Be of good courage, and bring us of the fruits of the land. Now it was the time when the first ripe grapes are fit to be eaten.<li>And when they were gone up, they viewed the land from the desert of Sin, unto Rohob as you enter into Emath.<li>And they went up at the south side, and came to Hebron, where were Achiman and Sisai and Tholmai the sons of Enac. For Hebron was built seven years before Tanis the city of Egypt.<li>And going forward as far as the torrent of the cluster of grapes, they cut off a branch with its cluster of grapes, which two men carried upon a lever. They took also of the pomegranates and of the figs of that place:<li>Which was called Nehelescol, that is to say, the torrent of the cluster of grapes, because from thence the children of Israel had carried a cluster of grapes.<li>And they that went to spy out the land returned after forty days, having gone round all the country,<li>And came to Moses and Aaron and to all the assembly of the children of Israel to the desert of Pharan, which is in Cades.

Wherefore Israel turned another way from him.<li>And when they had removed the camp from Cades, they came to mount Her, which is in the borders of the land of Edom:<li>Where the Lord spoke to Moses:<li>Let Aaron, saith he, go to his people: for he shall not go into the land which I have given the children of Israel, because he was incredulous to my words, at the waters of contradiction.<li>Take Aaron and his son with him, and bring them up into mount Hor:<li>And when thou hast stripped the father of his vesture, thou shalt vest therewith Eleazar his son: Aaron shall be gathered to his people, and die there.<li>Moses did as the Lord had commanded: and they went up into mount Hor before all the multitude.<li>And when he had stripped Aaron of his vestments, he vested Eleazar his son with them.<li>And Aaron being dead in the top of the mountain, he came down with Eleazar.<li>And all the multitude seeing that Aaron was dead, mourned for him thirty days throughout all their families.</ol><h2><a name=21>Numbers 21</a></h2><ol><li>And when king Arad the Chanaanite, who dwelt towards the south, had heard this, to wit, that Israel was come by the way of the spies, he fought against them, and overcoming them carried off their spoils.<li>But Israel binding himself by vow to the Lord, said: It thou wilt deliver this people into my hand, I will utterly destroy their cities.<li>And the Lord heard the prayers of Israel, and delivered up the Chanaanite, and they cut them off and destroyed their cities: and they called the name of that place Horma, that is to say, Anathema.<li>And they marched from mount Hor, by the way that leadeth to the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom. And the people began to be weary of their journey and labour:<li>And speaking against God end Moses, they said: Why didst thou bring us out of Egypt, to die in the wilderness? There is no bread, nor have we any waters: our soul now loatheth this very light food.<li>Wherefore the Lord sent among the people fiery serpents, which bit them and killed many of them.<li>Upon which they came to Moses, and said: We have sinned, because we have spoken against the Lord and thee: pray that he may take away these serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.<li>And the Lord said to him: Make brazen serpent, and set it up for a sign: whosoever being struck shall look on it, shall live.<li>Moses therefore made a brazen serpent, and set it up for a sign: which when they that were bitten looked upon, they were healed.<li>And the children of Israel setting forwards camped in Oboth.<li>And departing thence they pitched their tents in Jeabarim, in the wilderness, that faceth Moab toward the east.<li>And removing from thence, they came to the torrent Zared:<li>Which they left and encamped over against Arnon, which is in the desert and standeth out on the borders of the Amorrhite. For Arnon is the border of Moab, dividing the Moabites and the Amorrhites.<li>Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the Lord: As he did in the Red Sea, so will he do in the streams of Amen.<li>The rocks of the torrents were bowed down that they might rest in Ar, and lie down in the borders of the Moabites.<li>When they went from that place, the well appeared whereof the Lord said to Moses: Gather the people together, and I will give them water.<li>Then Israel sung this song: Let the well spring up. They sung thereto:<li>The well, which the princes dug, and the chiefs of the people prepared by the direction of the lawgiver, and with their staves. And they marched from the wilderness to Mathana.<li>From Mathana unto Nahaliel: from Nahaliel unto Bamoth.<li>From Bamoth, is a valley in the country of Moab, to the top of Phasga, which looked towards the desert.<li>And Israel sent messengers to Sehon king of the Amorrhites, saying:<li>I beseech thee that I may have leave to pass through thy land: we will not go aside into the fields or the vineyards, we will not drink waters of the wells, we will go the king's highway, till we be past thy borders.<li>And he would not grant that Israel should pass by his borders: but rather gathering an army, went forth to meet them in the desert, and came to Jasa, and fought against them.<li>And he was slain by them with the edge of the sword, and they possessed his land from the Arnon unto the Jeboc, and to the confines of the children of Ammon: for the borders of the Ammonites, were kept with a strong garrison.<li>So Israel took all his cities, and dwelt in the cities of the Amorrhite, to wit, in Hesebon, and in the villages thereof.<li>Hesebon was the city of Sehon the king of the Amorrhites, who fought against the king of Moab: and took all the land, that had been of his dominions, as far as the Arnon.<li>Therefore it is said in the proverb: Come into Hesebon, let the city of Sehon be built and set up:<li>A fire is gone out of Hesebon, a flame from the city of Sehon, and hath consumed Ar of the Moabites, and the inhabitants of the high places of the Arnon.<li>Woe to thee Moab: thou art undone, O people of Chamos. He hath given his sons to flight, and his daughters into captivity to Sehon the king of the Amorrhites.<li>Their yoke is perished from Hesebon unto Dibon, they came weary to Nophe, and unto Medaba.<li>So Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorrhite.<li>And Moses sent some to take a view of Jazer: and they took the villages of it, and conquered the inhabitants.<li>And they turned themselves, and went up by the way of Basan, and Og the king of Basan came against them with all his people, to fight in Edrai.<li>And the Lord said to Moses: Fear him not, for I have delivered him and all his people, and his country into thy hand: and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Sehon the king of the Amorrhites, the inhabitant of Hesebon.<li>So they slew him also with his sons, and all his people, not letting any one escape, and they possessed his land.</ol><h2><a name=22>Numbers 22</a></h2><ol><li>And they went forward and encamped in the plains of Moab, over against where Jericho is situate beyond the Jordan.<li>And Balac the son of Sephor, seeing all that Israel had done to the Amorrhite,<li>And that the Moabites were in great fear of him, and were not able to sustain his assault,<li>He said to the elders of Madian: So will this people destroy all that dwell in our borders, as the ox is wont to eat the grass to the very roots. Now he was at that time king in Moab.<li>He sent therefore messengers to Balaam the son of Beer, a soothsayer, who dwelt by the river of the land of the children of Ammon, to call him, and to say: Behold a people is come out of Egypt, that hath covered the face of the earth, sitting over against me.<li>Come therefore, and curse this people, because it is mightier than I: if by any means I may beat them and drive them out of my land: for I know that he whom thou shalt bless is blessed, and he whom thou shalt curse is cursed.<li>And the ancients of Moab, and the elders of Madian, went with the price of divination in their hands. And when they were come to Balaam, and had told him all the words of Balac:<li>He answered: Tarry here this night, and I will answer whatsoever the Lord shall say to me. And while they stayed with Balaam, God came and said to him:<li>What mean these men that are with thee?<li>He answered: Balac the son of Sephor king of the Moabites hath sent to me,<li>Saying: Behold a people that is come out of Egypt, hath covered the face of the land: come and curse them, if by any means I may fight with them and drive them away.<li>And God said to Balaam : Thou shalt not go with them, nor shalt thou curse the people: because it is blessed.<li>And he rose in the morning and said to the princes: Go into your country, because the Lord hath forbid me to come with you.<li>The princes returning, said to Balac: Balaam would not come with us.<li>Then he sent many more and more noble than he had sent before:<li>Who, when they were come to Balaam, said: Thus saith Balac the son of Sephor, Delay not to come to me:<li>For I am ready to honour thee, and will give thee whatsoever thou wilt: come and curse this people.<li>Balaam answered: If Balac would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot alter the word of the Lord my God, to speak either more or less.<li>I pray you to stay here this night also, that I may know what the Lord will answer me once more.<li>God therefore came to Balaam in the night, and said to him: It these men be come to call thee, arise and go with them: yet so, that thou do what I shall command thee.<li>Balaam arose in the morning, and saddling his ass went with them.<li>And God was angry. And an angel of the Lord stood in the way against Balaam, who sat on the ass, and had two servants with him.<li>The ass seeing the angel standing in the way, with a drawn sword, turned herself out of the way, and went into the field. And when Balaam beat her, and had a mind to bring her again to the way,<li>The angel stood in a narrow place between two walls, wherewith the vineyards were enclosed.<li>And the ass seeing him, thrust herself close to the wall, and bruised the foot of the rider. But he beat her again:<li>And nevertheless the angel going on to a narrow place, where there was no way to turn aside either to the right hand or to the left, stood to meet him.<li>And when the ass saw the angel standing, she fell under the feet of the rider: who being angry beat her sides more vehemently with a staff.<li>And the Lord opened the mouth of the ass, and she said: What have I done to thee? Why strikest thou me, lo, now this third time?<li>Balaam answered: Because thou hast deserved it, and hast served me ill: I would I had a sword that I might kill thee.<li>The ass said: Am not I thy beast, on which thou hast been always accustomed to ride until this present day? tell me if I ever did the like thing to thee. But he said: Never.<li>Forthwith the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel standing in the way with a drawn sword, and he worshipped him falling flat on the ground.<li>And the angel said to him: Why beatest thou thy ass these three times? I am come to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse, and contrary to me:<li>And unless the ass had turned out of the way, giving place to me who stood against thee, I had slain thee, and she should have lived.<li>Balaam said: I have sinned, not knowing that thou didst stand against me: and now if it displease thee that I go, I will return.<li>The angel said: Go with these men, and see thou speak no other thing than what I shall command thee. He went therefore with the princes.<li>And when Balac heard it he came forth to meet him in a town of the Moabites, that is situate in the uttermost borders of Arnon.<li>And he said to Balaam: I sent messengers to call thee, why didst thou not come immediately to me? was it because I am not able to reward thy coming?<li>He answered him: Lo, here I am: shall I have power to speak any other thing but that which God shall put in my mouth?<li>So they went on together, and came into a city, that was in the uttermost borders of his kingdom.<li>And when Balac had killed oxen and sheep, he sent presents to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.<li>And when morning was come, he brought him to the high places of Baal, and he beheld the uttermost part of the people.</ol><h2><a name=23>Numbers 23</a></h2><ol><li>And Balaam said to Balac: Build me here seven altars, and prepare as many calves, and the same number of rams.<li>And when he had done according to the word of Balaam, they laid together a calf and a ram upon every altar.<li>And Balaam said to Balac: Stand a while by thy burnt offering, until I go, to see if perhaps the Lord will meet me, and whatsoever he shall command, I will speak to thee.<li>And when he was gone with speed, God met him. And Balaam speaking to him, said: I have erected seven altars, and have laid on everyone a calf and a ram.<li>And the Lord put the word in his mouth, and said: Return to Balac, and thus shalt thou speak.<li>Returning he found Balac standing by his burnt offering, with all the princes of the Moabites:<li>And taking up his parable, he said: Balac king of the Moabites hath brought me from Aram, from the mountains of the east: Come, said he, and curse Jacob: make haste and detest Israel.<li>How shall I curse him, whom God hath not cursed? By what means should I detest him, whom the Lord detesteth not?<li>I shall see him from the tops of the rocks, and shall consider him from the hills. This people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.<li>Who can count the dust of Jacob, and know the number of the stock of Israel? Let my soul die the death of the just, and my last end be like to them.<li>And Balac said to Balaam: What is this that thou dost? I sent for thee to curse my enemies: and thou contrariwise blessest them.<li>He answered him: Call I speak any thing else but what the Lord commandeth?<li>Balac therefore said: Come with me to another place from whence thou mayest see part of Israel, and canst not see them all: curse them from thence.<li>And when he had brought him to a high place, upon the top of mount Phasga, Balaam built seven altars, and laying on every one a calf and a ram,<li>He said to Balac: Stand here by thy burnt offering while I go to meet him.<li>And when the Lord had met him, and had put the word in his mouth, he said: Return to Balac, and thus shalt thou say to him.<li>Returning he found him standing by his burnt sacrifice, and the princes of the Moabites with him. And Balac said to him: What hath the Lord spoken?<li>But he taking up his parable, said: Stand, O Balac, and give ear: hear, thou son of Sephor:<li>God is not a man, that he should lie, nor as the son of man, that he should be changed. Hath he said then, and will he not do? hath he spoken, and will he not fulfil?<li>I was brought to bless, the blessing I am not able to hinder.<li>There is no idol in Jacob, neither is there an image god to be seen in Israel. The Lord his God is with him, and the sound of the victory of the king in him.<li>God hath brought him out of Egypt, whose strength is like to the rhinoceros.<li>There is no soothsaying in Jacob, nor divination in Israel. In their times it shall be told to Jacob and to Israel what God hath wrought.<li>Behold the people shall rise up as a lioness, and shall lift itself up as a lion: it shall not lie down till it devour the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.<li>And Balac said to Balaam: Neither curse, nor bless him.<li>And he said: Did I not tell thee, that whatsoever God should command me, that I would do?<li>And Balac said to him: Come and I will bring thee to another place; if peradventure it please God that thou mayest curse them from thence.<li>And when he had brought him upon the top of mount Phogor, which looketh towards the wilderness,<li>Balaam said to him: Build me here seven altars, and prepare as many calves, and the same number of rams.<li>Balac did as Balaam had said: and he laid on every altar, a calf and a ram.</ol><h2><a name=24>Numbers 24</a></h2><ol><li>And when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord that he should bless Israel. he went not as he had gone before, to seek divination: but setting his face towards the desert,<li>And lifting up his eyes, he saw Israel abiding in their tents by their tribes: and the spirit of God rushing upon him,<li>He took up his parable and said: Balaam the son of Beor hath said: The man hath said, whose eye ire stopped up:<li>The hearer of the words of God hath said, he that hath beheld the vision of the Almighty, he that falleth, and so his eyes are opened:<li>How beautiful are thy tabernacles, O Jacob, and thy tents, O Israel!<li>As woody valleys, as watered gardens near the rivers, as tabernacles which the Lord hath pitched, as cedars by the waterside.<li>Water shall flow out of his bucket, and his seed shall be in many waters. For Agag his king shall be removed, and his kingdom shall be taken awry.<li>God hath brought him out of Egypt, whose strength is like to the rhinoceros. They shall devour the nations that are his enemies, and break their bones, and pierce them with arrows.<li>Lying down he hath slept as a lion, and as a lioness, whom none shall dare to rouse. He that blesseth thee, shall also himself be blessed: he that curseth thee shall be reckoned accursed.<li>And Balac being angry against Balaam, clapped his hands together and said: I called thee to curse my enemies, and thou on the contrary hast blessed them three times.<li>Return to thy place. I had determined indeed greatly to honour thee, but the Lord hath deprived thee of the honour designed for thee.<li>Balaam made answer to Balac: Did I not say to thy messengers, whom thou sentest to me:<li>If Balac would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God, to utter any thing of my own head either good or evil: but whatsoever the Lord shall say, that I will speak?<li>But yet going to my people, I will give thee counsel, what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.<li>Therefore taking up his parable, again he said: Balaam the son of Beor hath said: The man whose eye is stopped up, hath said:<li>The hearer of the words of God hath said, who knoweth the doctrine of the Highest, and seeth the visions of the Almighty, who falling hath his eyes opened:<li>I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not near. A STAR SHALL RISE out of Jacob and a sceptre shall spring up from Israel: and shall strike the chiefs of Moab, and shall waste all the children of Seth.<li>And he shall possess Idumea: the inheritance of Seir shall come to their enemies, but Israel shall do manfully<li>Out of Jacob shall he come that shall rule, and shall destroy the remains of the city.<li>And when he saw Amalec, he took up his parable, and said: Amalec the beginning of nations, whose latter ends shall be destroyed.<li>He saw also the Cinite: and took up his parable, and said: Thy habitation in- deed is strong: but though thou build thy nest in a rock,<li>And thou be chosen of the stock of Cin, how long shalt thou be able to continue? For Assur shall take thee captive.<li>And taking up his parable, again he said: Alas, who shall live when God shall do these things?<li>They shall come in galleys from Italy, they shall overcome the Assyrians, and shall waste the Hebrews, and at the last they themselves also shall perish.<li>And Balaam rose, and returned to his place: Balac also returned the way that he came.</ol><h2><a name=25>Numbers 25</a></h2><ol><li>And Israel at that time abode in Settim, and the people committed fornication with the daughters of Moab,<li>Who called them to their sacrifices. And they ate of them, and adored their gods.<li>And Israel was initiated to Beelphegor: upon which the Lord being angry,<li>Said to Moses: Take all the princes of the people, and hang them up on gibbets against the sun: that my fury may be turned away from Israel.<li>And Moses said to the judges of Israel: Let every man kill his neighbours, that have been initiated to Beelphegor.<li>And behold one of the children of Israel went in before his brethren to a harlot of Madian, in the sight of Moses, and of all the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle.<li>And when Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest saw it, he rose up from the midst; of the multitude, and taking a dagger,<li>Went in after the Israelite into the brothel house, and thrust both of them through together, to wit, the man and the woman in the genital parts. And the scourge ceased from the children of Israel:<li>And there were slain four and twenty thousand men.<li>And the Lord said to Moses:<li>Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned away my wrath from the children of Israel: because he was moved with my zeal against them, that I myself might not destroy the children of Israel in my zeal.<li>Therefore say to him: Behold I give him the peace of my covenant,<li>And the covenant of the priesthood for ever shall be both to him and his seed, because he hath been zealous for his God, and hath made atonement for the wickedness of the children of Israel.<li>And the name of the Israelite, was slain with the woman of Madian, was Zambri the son of Salu, a prince the kindred and tribe of Simeon.<li>And the Madianite woman, that was slain with him, was called Cozbi the daughter of Sur, a most noble prince among the Madianites.<li>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:<li>Let the Madianites find you enemies, and slay you them:<li>Because they also have acted like enemies against you, and have guilefully deceived you by the idol Phogor, and Cozbi their sister, a daughter of a prince of Madian, who was slain in the day the plague for the sacrilege of Phogor.</ol><h2><a name=26>Numbers 26</a></h2><ol><li>After the blood of the guilty was shed, the Lord said to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron, the priest:<li>Number the whole sum of the children of Israel from twenty years old and upward, by their houses and kindreds, all that are able to go forth to war.<li>Moses therefore and Eleazar the priest, being in the plains of Moab upon the Jordan over against Jericho, spoke to them that were<li>From twenty years old and upward, as the Lord had commanded: and this is the number of them:<li>Ruben the firstborn of Israel.

Each shall give towns to the Levites according to the extent of their inheritance.<li>The Lord said to Moses:<li>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: When you shall have passed over the Jordan into the land of Chanaan,<li>Determine what cities shall be for the refuge of fugitives, who have shed blood against their will.<li>And when the fugitive shall be in them, the kinsman of him that is slain may not have power to kill him, until he stand before the multitude, and his cause be judged.<li>And of those cities, that are separated for the refuge of fugitives,<li>Three shall be beyond the Jordan, and three in the land of Chanaan,<li>As well for the children of Israel as for strangers and sojourners, that he may flee to them, who hath shed blood against his will.<li>If any man strike with iron, and he die that was struck : he shall be guilty of murder, and he himself shall die.<li>If he throw a stone, and he that is struck die: he shall be punished in the same manner.<li>If he that is struck with wood die: he shall be revenged by the blood of him that struck him.<li>The kinsman of him that was slain, shall kill the murderer: as soon as he apprehendeth him, he shall kill him.<li>If through hatred any one push a man, or fling any thing- at him with ill design:<li>Or being his enemy, strike; him with his hand, and he die: the striker shall be guilty of murder: the kinsman of him that was slain as soon as he findeth him, shall kill him.<li>But if by chance medley, and without hatred,<li>And enmity, he do any of these things,<li>And this be proved in the hearing of the people, and the cause be debated between him that struck, and the next of kin:<li>The innocent shall be delivered from the hand of the revenger, and shall be brought back by sentence into the city, to which he had fled, and he shall abide there until the death of the high priest, that is anointed with the holy oil.<li>If the murderer be found without the limits of the cities that are appointed for the banished,<li>And be struck by him that is the avenger of blood: he shall not be guilty that killed him.<li>For the fugitive ought to have stayed in the city until the death of the high priest: and after he is dead, then shall the manslayer return to his own country.<li>These things shall be perpetual, and for an ordinance in all your dwellings.<li>The murderer shall be punished by witnesses: none shall be condemned upon the evidence of one man.<li>You shall not take money of him that is guilty of blood, but he shall die forthwith.<li>The banished and fugitives before the death of the high priest may by no means return into their own cities.<li>Defile not the land of your habitation, which is stained with the blood of the innocent: neither can it otherwise be expiated, but by his blood that hath shed the blood of another.<li>And thus shall your possession he cleansed, myself abiding with you. For I am the Lord that dwell among the children of Israel.</ol><h2><a name=36>Numbers 36</a></h2><ol><li>And the princes of the families of Galaad, the son of Machir, the son of Manasses, of the stock Of the children of Joseph, came and spoke to Moses before the princes of Israel, and said:<li>The Lord hath commanded thee, my lord, that thou shouldst divide the land by lot to the children of Israel, and that thou shouldst give to the daughters of Salphaad our brother the possession due to their father:<li>Now if men of another tribe take them to wives, their possession will follow them, and being transferred to another tribe, will be a diminishing of our inheritance.<li>And so it shall come to pass, that when the jubilee, that is, the fiftieth year of remission, is come, the distribution made by the lots shall be confounded, and the possession of the one shall pass to the others.<li>Moses answered the children of Israel, and said by the command of the Lord: The tribe of the children of Joseph hath spoken rightly.<li>And this is the law promulgated by the Lord touching the daughters of Salphaad: Let them marry to whom they will, only so that it be to men of their own tribe.<li>Lest the possession of the children of Israel be mingled from tribe to tribe. For all men shall marry wives of their own tribe and kindred:<li>And all women shall take husbands of the same tribe: that the inheritance may remain in the families,<li>And that the tribes be not mingled one with another, but remain so<li>As they were separated by the Lord. And the daughters of Salphaad did as was commanded:<li>And Maala, and Thersa, and Hegla, and Melcha, and Noa were married to the sons of their uncle by their father<li>Of the family of Manasses, who was the son of Joseph: and the possession that had been allotted to them, remained in the tribe and family of their father.<li>These are the commandments and judgments, which the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses to the children of Israel, in the plains of Moab upon the Jordan over against Jericho.</ol></body></html>
