<ol>
<li><span>The word of the Lord that came to Sophonias the son of
Chusi, the son of Godolias, the son of Amarias, the son of
Ezechias, in the days of Josias the son of Amon king of
Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>Gathering, I will gather together all things from off the
face of the land, saith the Lord:</span></li>
<li><span>I will gather man, and beast, I will gather the birds of
the air, and the fishes of the sea: and the ungodly shall meet with
ruin: and I will destroy men from off the face of the land, saith
the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will stretch out my hand upon Juda, and upon all
the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and I will destroy out of this place
the remnant of Baal, and the names of the wardens of the temples
with the priests:</span></li>
<li><span>And them that worship the host of heaven upon the tops of
houses, and them that adore, and swear by the Lord, and swear by
Melchom.</span></li>
<li><span>And them that turn away from following after the Lord,
and that have not sought the Lord, nor searched after
him.</span></li>
<li><span>Be silent before the face of the Lord God: for the day of
the Lord is near, for the Lord hath prepared a victim, he hath
sanctified his guests.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall come to pass in the day of the victim of the
Lord, that I will visit upon the princes, and upon the king's sons,
and upon all such as are clothed with strange apparel.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will visit in that day upon every one that entereth
arrogantly over the threshold: them that fill the house of the Lord
their God with iniquity and deceit.</span></li>
<li><span>And there shall be in that day, saith the Lord, the noise
of a cry from the fish gate, and a howling from the Second, and a
great destruction from the hills.</span></li>
<li><span>Howl, ye inhabitants of the Morter. All the people of
Chanaan is hush, all are cut off that were wrapped up in
silver.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will
search Jerusalem with lamps, and will visit upon the men that are
settled on their lees: that say in their hearts: The Lord will not
do good, nor will he do evil.</span></li>
<li><span>And their strength shall become a booty, and their houses
as a desert: and they shall build houses, and shall not dwell in
them: and they shall plant vineyards, and shall not drink the wine
of them.</span></li>
<li><span>The great day of the Lord is near, it is near and
exceeding swift: the voice of the day of the Lord is bitter, the
mighty man shall there meet with tribulation.</span></li>
<li><span>That day is a day of wrath, a day of tribulation and
distress, a day of calamity and misery, a day of darkness and
obscurity, a day of clouds and whirlwinds,</span></li>
<li><span>A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities,
and against the high bulwarks.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will distress men, and they shall walk like blind
men, because they have sinned against the Lord: and their blood
shall be poured out as earth, and their bodies as dung.</span></li>
<li><span>Neither shall their silver and their gold be able to
deliver them in the day of the wrath of the Lord: all the land
shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy, for he shall make
even a speedy destruction of all them that dwell in the
land.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="2">Sophonias 2</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Assemble yourselves together, be gathered together, O
nation not worthy to be loved:</span></li>
<li><span>Before the decree bring forth the day as dust passing
away, before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you, before the
day of the Lord's indignation come upon you.</span></li>
<li><span>Seek the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, you that have
wrought his judgment: seek the just, seek the meek: if by any means
you may be hid in the day of the Lord's indignation.</span></li>
<li><span>For Gaza shall be destroyed, and Ascalon shall be a
desert, they shall cast out Azotus at noonday, and Accaron shall be
rooted up.</span></li>
<li><span>Woe to you that inhabit the sea coast, O nation of
reprobates: the word of the Lord upon you, O Chanaan, the land of
the Philistines, and I will destroy thee, so that there shall not
be an inhabitant.</span></li>
<li><span>And the sea coast shall be the resting place of
shepherds, and folds for cattle:</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall be the portion of him that shall remain of
the house of Juda, there they shall feed: in the houses of Ascalon
they shall rest in the evening: because the Lord their God will
visit them, and bring back their captivity.</span></li>
<li><span>I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the blasphemies of
the children of Ammon, with which they reproached my people, and
have magnified themselves upon their borders.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore as I live, saith the Lord of hosts the God of
Israel, Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as
Gomorrha, the dryness of thorns, and heaps of salt, and a desert
even for ever: the remnant of my people shall make a spoil of them,
and the residue of my nation shall possess them.</span></li>
<li><span>This shall befall them for their pride: because they have
blasphemed, and have been magnified against the people of the Lord
of hosts.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord shall be terrible upon them, and shall consume
all the gods of the earth: and they shall adore him every man from
his own place, all the islands of the Gentiles.</span></li>
<li><span>You Ethiopians, also shall be slain with my
sword.</span></li>
<li><span>And he will stretch out his hand upon the north, and will
destroy Assyria: and he will make the beautiful city a wilderness,
and as a place not passable, and as a desert.</span></li>
<li><span>And flocks shall lie down in the midst thereof, all the
beasts of the nations: and the bittern and the urchin shall lodge
in the threshold thereof: the voice of the singing bird in the
window, the raven on the upper post, for I will consume her
strength.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the glorious city that dwelt in security: that
said in her heart: I am, and there is none beside me: how is she
become a desert, a place for beasts to lie down in? every one that
passeth by her, shall hiss, and wag his hand.</span></li>
</ol>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="3">Sophonias 3</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Woe to the provoking, and redeemed city, the
dove.</span></li>
<li><span>She hath not hearkened to the voice, neither hath she
received discipline: she hath not trusted in the Lord, she drew not
near to her God.</span></li>
<li><span>Her princes are in the midst of her as roaring lions: her
judges are evening wolves, they left nothing for the
morning.</span></li>
<li><span>Her prophets are senseless men without faith: her priests
have polluted the sanctuary, they have acted unjustly against the
law.</span></li>
<li><span>The just Lord is in the midst thereof, he will not do
iniquity: in the morning, in the morning he will bring his judgment
to light, and it shall not be hid: but the wicked man hath not
known shame.</span></li>
<li><span>I have destroyed the nations, and their towers are beaten
down: I have made their ways desert, so that there is none that
passeth by: their cities are desolate, there is not a man
remaining, nor any inhabitant.</span></li>
<li><span>I said: Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive
correction: and her dwelling shall not perish, for all things
wherein I have visited her: but they rose early and corrupted all
their thoughts.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore expect me, saith the Lord, in the day of my
resurrection that is to come, for my judgment is to assemble the
Gentiles, and to gather the kingdoms: and to pour upon them my
indignation, all my fierce anger: for with the fire of my jealousy
shall all the earth be devoured.</span></li>
<li><span>Because then I will restore to the people a chosen lip,
that all may call upon the name of the Lord, and may serve him with
one shoulder.</span></li>
<li><span>From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, shall my suppliants
the children of my dispersed people bring me an
offering.</span></li>
<li><span>In that day thou shalt not be ashamed for all thy doings,
wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take
away out of the midst of thee thy proud boasters, and thou shalt no
more be lifted up because of my holy mountain.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will leave in the midst of thee a poor and needy
people: and they shall hope in the name of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak
lies, nor shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for
they shall feed, and shall lie down, and there shall be none to
make them afraid.</span></li>
<li><span>Give praise, O daughter of Sion: shout, O Israel: be
glad, and rejoice with all thy heart, O daughter of
Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord hath taken away thy judgment, he hath turned
away thy enemies: the king of Israel the Lord is in the midst of
thee, thou shalt fear evil no more.</span></li>
<li><span>In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem: Fear not: to
Sion: Let not thy hands be weakened.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty, he will
save: he will rejoice over thee with gladness, he will be silent in
his love, he will be joyful over thee in praise.</span></li>
<li><span>The triflers that were departed from the law, I will
gather together, because they were of thee: that thou mayest no
more suffer reproach for them.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I will cut off all that have afflicted thee at
that time: and I will save her that halteth, and will gather her
that was cast out: and I will get them praise, and a name, in all
the land where they had been put to confusion.</span></li>
<li><span>At that time, when I will bring you: and at the time that
I will gather you: for I will give you a name, and praise among all
the people of the earth, when I shall have brought back your
captivity before your eyes, saith the Lord.</span></li>
