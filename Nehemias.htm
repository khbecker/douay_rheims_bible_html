<ol>
<li><span>The words of Nehemias the son of Helchias. And it came to
pass in the month of Casleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in the
castle of Susa,</span></li>
<li><span>That Hanani one of my brethren came, he and some men of
Juda; and I asked them concerning the Jews, that remained and were
left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And they said to me: They that have remained, and are
left of the captivity there in the province, are in great
affliction, and reproach: and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down,
and the gates thereof are burnt with fire.</span></li>
<li><span>And when I had heard these words, I sat down, and wept,
and mourned for many days: and I fasted, and prayed before the face
of the God of heaven.</span></li>
<li><span>And I said: WI beseech thee, 0 Lord God of heaven,
strong, great, and terrible, who keepest covenant and mercy with
those that love thee, and keep thy commandments :</span></li>
<li><span>Let thy ears be attentive, and thy eyes open, to hear the
prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, night and day,
for the children of Israel thy servants: and I confess the sins of
the children of Israel, by which they have sinned against thee: I
and my father's house have sinned.</span></li>
<li><span>We have been seduced by vanity, and have not kept thy
commandments, and ceremonies and judgments, which thou hast
commanded thy servant Moses.</span></li>
<li><span>Remember the word that thou commandedst to Moses thy
servant, saying: If you shall transgress, I will scatter you abroad
among the nations:</span></li>
<li><span>But if you return to me, and keep my commandments, and do
them, though you should be led away to the uttermost parts of the
world, I will gather you from thence, and bring you back to the
place which I have chosen for my name to dwell there.</span></li>
<li><span>And these are thy servants, and thy people : whom thou
hast redeemed by thy great strength, and by thy mighty
hand.</span></li>
<li><span>I beseech thee, O Lord, let thy ear be attentive to the
prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants who desire
to fear thy name: and direct thy servant this day, and give him
mercy before this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="2">2 Esdras 2</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And it came to pass in the month of Nisan, in the
twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king: that wine was before him,
and I took up the wine, and gave it to the king: and I was as one
languishing away before his face.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said to me: Why is thy countenance sad,
seeing thou dost not appear to be sick? this is not without cause,
but some evil, I know not what, is in thy heart. And I was seized
with an exceeding great fear:</span></li>
<li><span>And I said to the king: O king, live for ever: why should
not my countenance be sorrowful, seeing the city of the place of
the sepulchres of my fathers is desolate, and the gates thereof are
burnt with fire?</span></li>
<li><span>Then the king said to me: For what dost thou make
request? And I prayed to the God of heaven,</span></li>
<li><span>And I said to the king: If it seem good to the king, and
if thy servant hath found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldst
send me into Judea to the city of the sepulchre of my father, and I
will build it.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said to me, and the queen that sat by him:
For how long shall thy journey be, and when wilt thou return? And
it pleased the king, and he sent me: and I fixed him a
time.</span></li>
<li><span>And I said to the king: If it seem good to the king, let
him give me letters to the governors of the country beyond the
river, that they convey me over, till I come into
Judea:</span></li>
<li><span>And a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, to
give me timber that I may cover the gates of the tower of the
house, and the walls of the city, and the house that I shall enter
into. And the king gave me according to the good hand of my God
with me.</span></li>
<li><span>And I came to the governors of the country beyond the
river, and gave them the king's letters. And the king had sent wish
me captains of soldiers, and horsemen.</span></li>
<li><span>And Sanaballat the Horonite, and Tobias the servant, the
Ammonite, heard it, and it grieved them exceedingly, that a man was
come, who sought the prosperity of the children of
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And I came to Jerusalem, and was there three
days.</span></li>
<li><span>And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me, and
I told not any man what God had put in my heart to do in Jerusalem,
and there was no beast with me, but the beast that I rode
upon.</span></li>
<li><span>And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, and
before the dragon fountain, and to the dung gate, and I viewed the
wall of Jerusalem which was broken down, and the gates thereof
which were consumed with fire.</span></li>
<li><span>And I passed to the gate of the fountain, and to the
king's aqueduct, and there was no place for the beast on which I
rode to pass.</span></li>
<li><span>And I went up in the night by the torrent, and viewed the
wall, and going back I came to the gate of the valley, and
returned.</span></li>
<li><span>But the magistrates knew not whither I went, or what I
did: neither had I as yet told any thing to the Jews, or to the
priests, or to the nobles, or to the magistrates, or to the rest
that did the work.</span></li>
<li><span>Then I said to them: You know the affliction wherein we
are, because Jerusalem is desolate, and the gates thereof are
consumed with fire: come, and let us build up the walls of
Jerusalem, and let us be no longer a reproach.</span></li>
<li><span>And I shewed them how the hand of my God was good with
me, and the king's words, which he had spoken to me, and I said:
Let us rise up, and build. And their hands were strengthened in
good.</span></li>
<li><span>But Sanaballat the Horonite, and Tobias the servant, the
Ammonite, and Gossem the Arabian heard of it, and they scoffed at
us, and despised us, and said: What is this thing that you do? are
you going to rebel against the king?</span></li>
<li><span>And I answered them, and said to them: The God of heaven
he helpeth us, and we are his servants: let us rise up and build:
but you have no part, nor justice, nor remembrance in
Jerusalem.</span></li>

<li><span>Then Eliasib the high priest arose, and his brethren the
priests, and they built the flock gate: they sanctified it, and set
up the doors thereof, even unto the tower of a hundred cubits they
sanctified it unto the tower of Hananeel.</span></li>
<li><span>And next to him the men of Jericho built: and next to
them built Zachur the son of Amri.</span></li>

did not put their necks to the work of their Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And Joiada the son of Phasea, and Mosollam the son of
Besodia built the old gate: they covered it and set up the doors
thereof, and the locks, and the bars.</span></li>
<li><span>And next to them built Meltias the Gabaonite, and Jadon
the Meronathite, the men of Gabaon and Maspha, for the governor
that was in the country beyond the river.</span></li>

<li><span>And next to him built Sellum the son of Alohes, lord of
half the street of Jerusalem, he and his daughters.</span></li>
<li><span>And the gate of the valley Hanun built, and the
inhabitants of Zanoe: they built it, and set up the doors thereof,
and the locks, and the bars, and a thousand cubits in the wall unto
the gate of the dunghill.</span></li>
<li><span>And the gate of the dunghill Melchias the son of Rechab
built, lord of the street of Bethacharam : he built it, and set up
the doors thereof, and the locks, and the bars.</span></li>
<li><span>And the gate of the fountain Sellum the son of Cholhoza
built, lord of the street of Maspha: he built it, and covered it,
and set up the doors thereof, and the locks, and the bare, and the
walls of the pool of Siloe unto the king's guard, and unto the
steps that go down from the city of David.</span></li>
<li><span>After him built Nehemias the son of Azboc, lord of half
the street of Bethsur, as far as over against the sepulchre of
David, and to the pool, that was built with great labour, and to
the house of the mighty.</span></li>
<li><span>After him built the Levites, Rehum the son of Benni.
After him built Hasebias, lord of half the street of Ceila in his
own street.</span></li>
<li><span>After him built their brethren Bavai the son of Enadad,

<li><span>And next to him Aser the son of Josue, lord of Maspha,

<li><span>After him built Benjamin and Hasub, over against their

<li><span>Phalel, the son of Ozi, over against the bending and the
tower, which lieth out from the king's high house, that is, in the
court of the prison: after him Phadaia the son of

<li><span>And the Nathinites dwelt in Ophel, as far as over against

<li><span>And within the chamber of the corner of the dock gate,
the goldsmiths and the merchants built.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="4">2 Esdras 4</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And it came to pass, that when Sanaballat heard that we
were building the wall he was angry: and being moved exceedingly he
scoffed at the Jews.</span></li>
<li><span>And said before his brethren, and the multitude of the
Samaritans: What are the silly Jews doing? Will the Gentiles let
them alone? will they sacrifice and make an end in a day? are they
able to raise stones out of the heaps of the rubbish, which are
burnt?</span></li>
<li><span>Tobias also the Ammonite who was by him said : Let them
build: if a fox go up, he will leap over their stone
wall.</span></li>
<li><span>Hear thou our God, for we are despised: turn their
reproach upon their own head, and give them to be despised in a
land of captivity.</span></li>
<li><span>Cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be
blotted out from before thy face, because they have mocked thy
builders.</span></li>
<li><span>So we built the wall, and joined it all together unto the
half thereof: and the heart of the people was excited to
work.</span></li>
<li><span>And it came to pass, when Sanaballat, and Tobias, and the
Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Azotians heard that the walls
of Jerusalem were made up, and the breaches began to be closed,
that they were exceedingly angry.</span></li>
<li><span>And they all assembled themselves together, to come, and
to fight against Jerusalem, and to prepare ambushes.</span></li>
<li><span>And we prayed to our God, and set watchmen upon the wall
day and night against them.</span></li>
<li><span>And Juda said: The strength of the bearer of burdens is
decayed, and the rubbish is very much, and we shall not be able to
build the wall.</span></li>
<li><span>And our enemies said: Let them not know, nor understand,
till we come in the midst of them, and kill them, and cause the
work to cease.</span></li>
<li><span>And it came to pass, that when the Jews that dwelt by
them came and told us ten times, out of all the places from whence
they came to us,</span></li>
<li><span>I set the people in the place behind the wall round about
in order, with their swords, and spears, and bows.</span></li>
<li><span>And I looked and rose up: and I said to the chief men and
the magistrates, and to the rest of the common people: be not
afraid of them. Remember the Lord who is great and terrible, and
fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, and your
wives, and your houses.</span></li>
<li><span>And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that the
thing had been told us, that God defeated their counsel. And we
returned all of us to the walls, every man to his work.</span></li>
<li><span>And it came to pass from that day forward, that half of
their young men did the work, and half were ready for to fight,
with spears, and shields, and bows, and coats of mail, and the
rulers were behind them in all the house of Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>Of them that built on the wall and that carried burdens,
and that laded: with one of his hands he did the work, and with the
other he held a sword.</span></li>
<li><span>For every one of the builders was girded with a sword
about his reins. And they built, and sounded with a trumpet by
me.</span></li>
<li><span>And I said to the nobles, and to the magistrates, and to
the rest of the common people: The work is great and wide, and we
are separated on the wall one far from another:</span></li>
<li><span>In what place soever you shall hear the sound of the
trumpet, run all thither unto us: our God will fight for
us.</span></li>
<li><span>And let us do the work: and let one half of us hold our
spears from the rising of the morning, till the stars
appear.</span></li>
<li><span>At that time also I said to the people: Let every one
with his servant stay in the midst of Jerusalem, and let us take
our turns in the night, and by day, to work.</span></li>
<li><span>Now I and my brethren, and my servants, and the watchmen
that followed me, did not put off our clothes: only every man
stripped himself when he was to be washed.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="5">2 Esdras 5</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Now there was a great cry of the people, and of their
wives against their brethren the Jews.</span></li>
<li><span>And there were some that said: Our sons and our daughters
are very many: Yet us take up corn for the price of them, and let
us eat and live.</span></li>
<li><span>And there were some that said: Let us mortgage our lands,
and our vineyards, and our houses, and let us take corn be- cause
of the famine.</span></li>
<li><span>And others said: Let us borrow money for the king's
tribute, and let us give up our fields and vineyards:</span></li>
<li><span>And now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren: and
our children as their children. Behold we bring into bondage our
sons and our daughters, and some of our daughters are bondwomen
already, neither have we wherewith to redeem them, and our fields
and our vineyards other men possess.</span></li>
<li><span>And I was exceedingly angry when I heard their cry
according to these words.</span></li>
<li><span>And my heart thought with myself: and I rebuked the
nobles and magistrates, and said to them: Do you every one ex- act
usury of your brethren ? And I gathered together a great assembly
against them,</span></li>
<li><span>And I said to them: We, as you know, have redeemed
according to our ability our brethren the Jews, that were sold to
the Gentiles: and will you then sell your brethren, for us to
redeem them ? And they held their peace, and found not what to
answer.</span></li>
<li><span>And I said to them: The thing you do is not good: why
walk you not in the fear of our God, that we be not exposed to the
reproaches of the Gentiles our enemies?</span></li>
<li><span>Both I and my brethren, and my servants, have lent money
and corn to many: let us all agree not to call for it again; let us
forgive the debt that is owing to us.</span></li>
<li><span>Restore ye to them this day their fields, and their
vineyards, and their oliveyards, and their houses: and the
hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the
oil, which you mere wont to exact of them, give it rather for
them.</span></li>
<li><span>And they said: We will restore, and we will require
nothing of them: and we will do as thou sayest. And I called the
priests and took an oath of them, to do according to what I had
said.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover I shook my lap, and said: So may God shake every
man that shall not accomplish this word, out of his house, and out
of his labours, thus may he be shaken out, and become empty. And
all the multitude said: Amen. And they praised God. And the people
did according to what was said.</span></li>
<li><span>And from the day, in which the king commanded me to be
governor in the land of Juda, from the twentieth year even to the
two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, for twelve years, I
and my brethren did not eat the yearly allowance that was due to
the governors.</span></li>
<li><span>But the former governors that had been before me, were
chargeable to the people, and took of them in bread, and wine, and
in money every day forty sides: and their officers also oppressed
the people. But I did not so for the fear of God.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover I built in the work of the wall, and I bought no
land, and all my servants were gathered together to the
work.</span></li>
<li><span>The Jews also and the magistrates to the number of one
hundred and fifty men, were at my table, besides them that came to
us from among the nations that were round about us.</span></li>
<li><span>And there was prepared for me day by day one ox, and six
choice rams, be- sides fowls, and once in ten days I gave store of
divers wines, and many other things: yet I did not require my
yearly allowance as governor: for the people were very much
impoverished.</span></li>
<li><span>Remember me, O my God, for good according to all that I
have done for this people.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="6">2 Esdras 6</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And it came to pass, when Sanaballat, and Tobias, and
Gossem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had
built the wall, and that there was no breach left in it, (though at
that time I had not set up the doors in the gates,)</span></li>
<li><span>Sanaballat and Gossem Rent to me, saying: Come, and let
us make a league together in the villages, in the plain of Ono. But
they thought to do me mischief.</span></li>
<li><span>And I sent messengers to them, saying: I am doing a great
work, and I cannot come down, lest it be neglected whilst I come,
and go down to you.</span></li>
<li><span>And they sent to me according to this word, four times:
and I answered them after the same manner.</span></li>
<li><span>And Sanaballat sent his servant to me the fifth time
according to the former word, and he had a letter in his hand
written in this manner:</span></li>
<li><span>It is reported amongst the Gentiles, and Gossem hath said
it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel, and therefore thou
buildest the wall, and hast a mind to set thyself king over them :
for which end</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast also set up prophets, to preach of thee at
Jerusalem, saying: There is a king in Judea. The king will hear of
these things: therefore come now, that we may take counsel
together.</span></li>
<li><span>And I sent to them, saying: There is no such thing done
as thou sayest: but thou feignest these things out of thy own
heart.</span></li>
<li><span>For all these men thought to frighten us, thinking that
our hands would cease from the work, and that we would leave off.
Wherefore I strengthened my hands the more:</span></li>
<li><span>And I went into the house of Samaia the son of Delaia,
the son of Metabeel privately. And he said: Let us consult together
in the house of God in the midst of the temple: and let us shut the
doors of the temple, for they will come to kill thee, and in the
night they will come to slay thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And I said: Should such a man as I Bee? and who is there
that being as I am, would go into the temple, to save his life? I
will not go in.</span></li>
<li><span>And I understood that God had not sent him, but that he
had spoken to me as if he had been prophesying, and Tobias, and
Sanaballat had hired him.</span></li>
<li><span>For he had taken money, that I being afraid should do
this thing, and sin, and they might have some evil to upbraid me
withal.</span></li>
<li><span>Remember me, O Lord, for Tobias and Sanaballat, according
to their works of this kind: and Noadias the prophet, and the rest
of the prophets that would have put me in fear.</span></li>
<li><span>But the wall was finished the five and twentieth day of
the month of Elul, in two and fifty days.</span></li>
<li><span>And it came to pass when all our enemies heard of it,
that all nations which were round about us, were afraid, and were
cast down within themselves, for they perceived that this work was
the work of God.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover in those days many letters were sent by the
principal men of the Jews to Tobias, and from Tobias there came
letters to them.</span></li>
<li><span>For there were many in Judea sworn to him, because he was
the son in law of Sechenias the son of Area, and Johanan his son
had taken to wife the daughter of Mosollam the son of
Barachias.</span></li>
<li><span>And they praised him also before me, and they related my
words to him: And Tobias sent letters to put me in
fear.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="7">2 Esdras 7</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Now after the wall was built, and I had set up the doors,
and numbered the porters and singing men, and Levites:</span></li>
<li><span>I commanded Hanani my brother, and Hananias ruler of the
house of Jerusalem, (for he seemed as a sincere man, and one that
feared God above the rest,)</span></li>
<li><span>And I said to them: Let not the gates of Jerusalem be
opened till the sun be hot. And while they were yet standing by,
the gates were shut, and barred: and I set watchmen of the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one by their courses, and every
mall over against his house.</span></li>
<li><span>And the city was very wide and great, and the people few
in the midst thereof, and the houses were not built.</span></li>
<li><span>But God had put in my heart, and I assembled the princes
and magistrates, and common people, to number them: and I found a
book of the number of them who came up at first, and therein it was
found written:</span></li>
<li><span>These are the children of the province, who came up from
the captivity of them that had been carried away, whom
Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon had carried away, and who
returned into Judea, every one into his own city.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>And the seventh month came: and the children of Israel
were in their cities. And all the people were gathered together as
one mall to the street which is before the water gate, and they
spoke to Esdras the scribe, to bring the book of the law of Moses,
which the Lord had commanded to Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Esdras the priest brought the law before the
multitude of men and women, and all those that could understand, in
the first day of the seventh month.</span></li>
<li><span>And he read it plainly in the street that was before the
water gate, from the morning until midday, before the men, and the
women, and all those that could understand: and the ears of all the
people were attentive to the book.</span></li>
<li><span>And Esdras the scribe stood upon a step of wood, which he
had made to speak upon, and there stood by him Mathathias, and
Semeia, and Ania, and Uria, and Helcia, and Maasia, on his right
hand: and on the left, Phadaia, Misael, and Melchia, and Hasum, and
Hasbadana, Zacharia and Mosollam.</span></li>
<li><span>And Esdras opened the book before all the people: for he
was above all the people: and when he had opened it, all the people
stood.</span></li>
<li><span>And Esdras blessed the Lord the great God: and all the
people answered, Amen, amen: lifting up their hands: and they bowed
down, and adored God with their faces to the ground.</span></li>
<li><span>Now Josue, and Bani, and Serebia, Jamin, Accub, Sephtai,
Odia, Maasia, Celtia, Azarias, Jozabed, Hanan, Phalaia, the
Levites, made silence among the people to hear the law: end the
people stood in their place.</span></li>
<li><span>And they read in the book of the law of God distinctly
and plainly to be understood: and they understood when it was
read.</span></li>
<li><span>And Nehemias (he is Athersatha) and Esdras the priest and
scribe, and the Levites who interpreted to all the people, said:
This is a holy day to the Lord our God: do not mourn, nor weep: for
all the people wept, when they heard the words of the
law.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to them: Go, eat fat meats, and drink sweet
wine, and send portions to them that have not prepared for
themselves: because it is the holy day of the Lord, and be not sad:
for the joy of the Lord is our strength.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Levites stilled all the people, saying: Hold your
peace, for the day is holy, and be not sorrowful.</span></li>
<li><span>So all the people went to eat and drink, and to send
portions, and to make great mirth: because they understood the
words that he had taught them.</span></li>
<li><span>And on the second day the chiefs of the families of all
the people, the priests, and the Levites were gathered together to
Esdras the scribe, that he should interpret to them the words of
the law.</span></li>
<li><span>And they found written in the law, that the Lord had
commanded by the hand of Moses, that the children of Israel should
dwell in tabernacles, on the feast, in the seventh
month:</span></li>
<li><span>And that they should proclaim and publish the word in all
their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying: Go forth to the mount, and
fetch branches of olive, and branches of beautiful wood, branches
of myrtle, and branches of palm, and branches of thick trees, to
make tabernacles, as it is written.</span></li>
<li><span>And the people went forth, and brought. And they made
themselves tabernacles every man on the top of his house, and in
their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the
street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of
Ephraim.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the assembly of them that were returned from the
captivity, made tabernacles, and dwelt in tabernacles: for since
the days of Josue the son of Nun the children of Israel had not
done so, until that day: and there was exceeding great
joy.</span></li>
<li><span>And he read in the book of the law of God day by day,
from the first day till the last, and they kept the solemnity seven
days, and in the eighth day a solemn assembly according to the
manner.</span></li>

<li><span>And in the four and twentieth day of the month the
children of Israel came together with fasting and with sackcloth,
and earth upon them.</span></li>
<li><span>And the seed of the children of Israel separated
themselves from every stranger: and they stood, and confessed their
sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>And they rose up to stand: and they read in the book of
the law of the Lord their God, four times in the day, and four
times they confessed, and adored the Lord their God.</span></li>
<li><span>And there stood up upon the seep of the Levites, Josue,
and Bani, and Cedmihel, Sabania, Bonni, Sarebias, Bani, and
Chanani: and they cried with a loud voice to the Lord their
God.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Levites Josue and Cedmihel, Bonni, Hasebnia,
Serebia, Oduia, Sebnia, and Phathahia, said: Arise, bless the Lord
your God from eternity to eternity: and blessed be the high name of
thy glory with all blessing and praise.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou thyself, O Lord alone, thou hast made heaven, and
the heaven of heavens, and all the host thereof: the earth and all
things that are in it: the seas and all that are therein: and thou
givest life to all these things, and the host of heaven adoreth
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou, O Lord God, art he who chosest Abram, and
broughtest him forth out of the fire of the Chaldeans, and gavest
him the name of Abraham.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou didst find his heart faithful before thee: and
thou madest a covenant with him, to give him the land of the
Chanaanite, of the Hethite, and of the Amorrhite, and of the
Pherezite, and of the Jebusite, and of the Gergezite, to give it to
his seed: and thou hast fulfilled thy words, because thou art
just.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt:
and thou didst hear their cry by the Red Sea.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharao, and upon
all his servants, and upon the people of his land : for thou
knewest that they dealt proudly against them: and thou madest
thyself a name, as it is at this day.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou didst divide the sea before them, and they
passed through the midst of the sea on dry land: but their
persecutors thou threwest into the depth, as a stone into mighty
waters.</span></li>
<li><span>And in a pillar of a cloud thou wast their leader by day,
and in a pillar of Are by night, that they might see the way by
which they went.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou camest down also to mount Sinai, and didst speak
with them from heaven, and thou gavest them right judgments, and
the law of truth, ceremonies, and good precepts.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou madest known to them thy holy sabbath, and didst
prescribe to them commandments, and ceremonies, and the law by the
hand of Moses thy servant.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou gavest them bread from heaven in their hunger,
and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock in their
thirst, and thou saidst to them that they should go in, and possess
the land, upon which thou hadst lifted up thy hand to give it
them.</span></li>
<li><span>But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened
their necks and hearkened not to thy commandments.</span></li>
<li><span>And they would not hear, and they remembered not thy
wonders which thou hadst done for them. And they hardened their
necks, and gave the head to return to their bondage, as it were by
contention. But thou, a forgiving God, gracious, and merciful,
longsuffering, and full of compassion, didst not forsake
them.</span></li>
<li><span>Yea when they had made also to themselves a molten calf,
and had said: This is thy God, that brought thee out of Egypt: and
hail committed great blasphemies :</span></li>
<li><span>Yet thou, in thy many mercies, didst not leave them in
the desert: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day
to lead them in the way, and the pillar of fire by night to shew
them the way by which they should go.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou gavest them thy good Spirit to teach them, and
thy manna thou didst not withhold from their mouth, and thou gavest
them water for their thirst.</span></li>
<li><span>Forty years didst thou feed them in the desert, and
nothing was wanting to them: their garments did not grow old, and
their feet were not worn.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou gavest them kingdoms, and nations, and didst
divide lots for them: and they possessed the land of Sehon, and the
land of the king of Hesebon, and the land of Og king of
Basan.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou didst multiply their children as the stars of
heaven, and broughtest them to the land concerning which thou hadst
said to their fathers, that they should go in and possess
it.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children came and possessed the land, and thou
didst humble before them the inhabitants of the land, the
Chanaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings,
and the people of the land, that they might do with them as it
pleased them.</span></li>
<li><span>And they took strong cities and a fat land, and possessed
houses full of all goods: cisterns made by others, vine- yards, and
oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: and they ate, and were
filled, and became fat, and abounded with de- light in thy great
goodness.</span></li>
<li><span>But they provoked thee to wrath, and departed from thee,
and threw thy law behind their backs: and they killed thy prophets,
who admonished them earnestly to return to thee : and they were
guilty of great blasphemies.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou gavest them into the hands of their enemies, and
they afflicted them. And in the time of their tribulation they
cried to thee, and thou heardest from heaven, and according to the
multitude of thy tender mercies thou gavest them saviours, to save
them from the hands of their enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>But after they had rest, they returned to do evil in thy
sight : and thou leftest them in the hand of their enemies, and
they had dominion over them. Then they returned, and cried to thee:
and thou heardest from heaven, and deliveredst them many times in
thy mercies.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou didst admonish them to re turn to thy law. But
they dealt proudly, and hearkened not to thy commandments, but
sinned against thy judgments, which if a man do, he shall live in
them: and they withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and
would not hear.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou didst forbear with them for many years, and
didst testify against them by thy spirit by the hand of thy
prophets: and they heard not, and thou didst deliver them into the
hand of the people of the lands.</span></li>
<li><span>Yet in thy very many mercies thou didst not utterly
consume them, nor forsake them: because thou art a merciful and
gracious God.</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore our God, great, strong and terrible, who
keepest covenant and mercy, turn not away from thy face all the
labour which hath come upon us, upon our kings, and our princes,
and our priests, and our prophets, and our fathers, and all the
people from the days of the king of Assur, until this
day.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou art just in all things that have come upon us:
because thou hast done truth, but we have done
wickedly.</span></li>
<li><span>Our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers have
not kept thy law, and have not minded thy commandments, and thy
testimonies which thou hast testified among them.</span></li>
<li><span>And they have not served thee in their kingdoms, and in
thy manifold goodness, which thou gavest them, and in the large and
fat land, which thou deliveredst before them, nor did they return
from their most wicked devices.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold we ourselves this day are bondmen: and the land,
which thou gavest our fathers, to eat the bread thereof, and the
good things thereof, and we ourselves are servants in
it.</span></li>
<li><span>And the fruits thereof grow up for the kings, whom thou
hast set over us for our sins, and they have dominion over our
bodies, and over our beasts, according to their will, and we are in
great tribulation.</span></li>
<li><span>and because of all this we ourselves make a covenant, and
write it, and our princes, our Levites, and our priests sign
it.</span></li>

<li><span>Now these are the priests and the Levites, that went up
with Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and Josue: Saraia, Jeremias,
Esdras,</span></li>
<li><span>Amaria, Melluch, Hattus,</span></li>
<li><span>Sebenias, Rheum, Merimuth,</span></li>
<li><span>Addo, Genthon, Abia,</span></li>
<li><span>Miamin, Madia, Belga,</span></li>
<li><span>Semeia, and Joiarib, Idaia, Sellum, Amoc,
Helcias,</span></li>
<li><span>Idaia. These were the chief of the priests, and of their
brethren in the days of Josue.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Levites, Jesua, Bennui, Cedmihel, Sarebia, Juda,
Mathanias, they and their brethren were over the hymns:</span></li>
<li><span>And Becbecia, and Hanni, and their brethren every one in
his office.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josue beget Joacim, and Joacim beget Eliasib, and
Eliasib beget Joiada,</span></li>
<li><span>And Joiada beget Jonathan, and Jonathan beget
Jeddoa.</span></li>
<li><span>And in the days of Joacim the priests and heads of the
families were : Of Saraia, Maraia: of Jeremias,
Hanania:</span></li>
<li><span>Of Esdras, Mosollam: and of Amaria, Johanan:</span></li>
<li><span>Of Milicho, Jonathan: of Sebenia, Joseph:</span></li>
<li><span>Of Haram, Edna: of Maraioth, Helci:</span></li>
<li><span>Of Adaia, Zacharia: of Genthon, Mosollam:</span></li>
<li><span>Of Abia, Zechri: of Miamin and Moadia,
Phelti:</span></li>
<li><span>Of Belga, Sammua of Semaia, Jonathan:</span></li>
<li><span>Of Joiarib, Mathanai: of Jodaia, Azzi:</span></li>
<li><span>Of Sellai, Celai: of Amoc, Heber:</span></li>
<li><span>Of Helcias, Hasebia: of Idaia, Nathanael.</span></li>
<li><span>The Levites the chiefs of the families in the days of
Eliasib, and Joiada, and Johanan, and Jeddoa, were recorded, and
the priests in the reign of Darius the Persian.</span></li>
<li><span>The sons of Levi, heads of the families were written in
the book of Chronicles, even unto the days of Jonathan the son of
Eliasib.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the chief of the Levites were Hasebia, Serebia, and
Josue the son of Cedmihel: and their brethren by their courses, to
praise and to give thanks ac- cording to the commandment of David
the man of God, and to wait equally in order.</span></li>
<li><span>Mathania, and Becbecia, Obedia, and Mosollam, Telmon,
Accub, were keepers of the gates and of the entrances before the
gates.</span></li>
<li><span>These were in the days of Joacim the son of Josue, the
son of Josedec, and in the days of Nehemias the governor, and of
Esdras the priest and scribe.</span></li>
<li><span>And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they
sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to
Jerusalem, and to keep the dedication, and to rejoice with
thanksgiving, and with singing, and with cymbals, and psalteries
and harps.</span></li>
<li><span>And the sons of the singing men were gathered together
out of the plain country about Jerusalem, and out of the villages
of Nethuphati,</span></li>
<li><span>And from the house of Galgal, and from the countries of
Geba and Azmaveth: for the singing men had built themselves
villages round about Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And the priests and the Levites purified, and they
purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.</span></li>
<li><span>And I made the princes of Juda go up upon the wall, and I
appointed two great choirs to give praise. And they went on the
right hand upon the wall toward the dunghill gate.</span></li>
<li><span>And after them went Osaias, and half of the princes of
Juda,</span></li>
<li><span>And Azarias, Esdras, and Mosollam, Judas, and Benjamin,
and Semeia, and Jeremias.</span></li>
<li><span>And of the sons of the priests with trumpets, Zacharias
the son of Jonathan. the son of Semeia, the son of Mathania; the
son of Michaia, the son of Zechur, the son of Asaph,</span></li>
<li><span>And his brethren Semeia, and Azareel Malalai, Galalai,
Maai, Nathanael, and Judas, and Hanani, with the musical
instruments of David the man of God: and Esdras the scribe before
them at the fountain gate.</span></li>
<li><span>And they went up over against them by the stairs of the
city of David, at the going up of the wall of the house of David,
and to the water gate eastward:</span></li>
<li><span>And the second choir of them that gave thanks went on the
opposite side, and I after them, and the half of the people upon
the wall, and upon the tower of the furnaces, even to the broad
wall,</span></li>
<li><span>And above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate,
and above the fish gate and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of
Emath, and even to the flock gate: and they stood still in the
watch gate.</span></li>
<li><span>And the two choirs of them that gave praise stood still
at the house of God, and I and the half of the magistrates with
me.</span></li>
<li><span>And the priests, Eliachim, Maasia, Miamin, Michea,
Elioenai, Zacharia, Hanania with trumpets,</span></li>
<li><span>And Maasia, and Semeia, and Eleazar, and Azzi, and
Johanan, and Melchia, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sung
loud, and Jezraia was their overseer:</span></li>
<li><span>And they sacrificed on that day great sacrifices, and
they rejoiced: for God had made them joyful with great joy: their
wives also and their children rejoiced, and the joy of Jerusalem
was heard afar off.</span></li>
<li><span>They appointed also in that day men over the storehouses
of the treasure, for the libations, and for the firstfruits, and
for the tithes, that the rulers of the city might bring them in by
them in honour of thanksgiving, for the priests and Levites: for
Juda was joyful in the priests and Levites that
assisted.</span></li>
<li><span>And they kept the watch of their God, and the observance
of expiation, and the singing men, and the porters, according to
the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.</span></li>
<li><span>For in the days of David and Asaph from the beginning
there were chief singers appointed, to praise with canticles, and
give thanks to God.</span></li>
<li><span>And all Israel, in the days of Zorobabel, and in the days
of Nehemias gave portions to the singing men, and to the porters,
day by day, and they sanctified the Levites, and the Levites
sanctified the sons of Aaron.</span></li>

</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="13">2 Esdras 13</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And on that day they read in the book of Moses in the
hearing of the people: and therein was found written, that the
Ammonites and the Moabites should not come in to the church of God
for ever:</span></li>
<li><span>Because they met not the children of Israel with bread
and water: and they hired against them Balaam, to curse them, and
our God turned the curse into blessing.</span></li>
<li><span>And it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that
they separated every stranger from Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And over this thing was Eliasib the priest, who was set
over the treasury of the house of our God, and was near akin to
Tobias.</span></li>
<li><span>And he made him a great storeroom, where before him they
laid up gifts, and frankincense, and vessels, and the tithes of the
corn, of the wine, and of the oil, the portions of the Levites, and
of the singing men, and of the porters, and the firstfruits of the
priests.</span></li>
<li><span>But in all this time I was not in Jerusalem, because in
the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon, I went to
the king, and after certain days I asked the king:</span></li>
<li><span>And I came to Jerusalem, and I understood the evil that
Eliasib had done for Tobias, to make him a storehouse in the courts
of the house of God.</span></li>
<li><span>And it seemed to me exceeding evil. And I cast forth the
vessels of the house of Tobias out of the storehouse.</span></li>
<li><span>And I commanded and they cleansed the storehouses: and I
brought thither again the vessels of the house of God, the
sacrifice, and the frankincense.</span></li>
<li><span>And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not
been given them: and that the Levites, and the singing men, and
they that ministered were fled away every man to his own
country:</span></li>
<li><span>And I pleaded the matter against the magistrates, and
said: Why have we forsaken the house of God? And I gathered them
together, and I made them to stand in their places.</span></li>
<li><span>And all Juda brought the tithe of the corn, and the wine,
and the oil into the storehouses.</span></li>
<li><span>And we set over the storehouses Selemias the priest, and
Sadoc the scribe, and of the Levites Phadaia, and next to them
Hanan the son of Zachur, the son of Mathania: for they were
approved as faithful, and to them were committed the portions of
their brethren.</span></li>
<li><span>Remember me, O my God, for this thing, and wipe not out
my kindnesses, which I have done relating to the house of my God
and his ceremonies.</span></li>
<li><span>In those days I saw in Juda some treading the presses on
the sabbath, and carrying sheaves, and lading asses with wine, and
grapes, and figs, and all manner of burthens, and bringing them
into Jerusalem on the sabbath day. And I charged them that they
should sell on a day on which it was lawful to sell.</span></li>
<li><span>Some Tyrians also dwelt there, who brought fish, and all
manner of wares: and they sold them on the sabbaths to the children
of Juda in Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And I rebuked the chief men of Juda, and said to them:
What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the sabbath
day?</span></li>
<li><span>Did not our fathers do these things, and our God brought
all this evil upon us, and upon this city? And you bring more wrath
upon Israel by violating the sabbath.</span></li>
<li><span>And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem
were at rest on the sabbath day, I spoke: and they shut the gates,
and I commanded that they should not open them till after the
sabbath: and I set some of my servants at the gates, that none
should bring in burthens on the sabbath day.</span></li>
<li><span>So the merchants, and they that sold all kinds of wares,
stayed without Jerusalem once or twice.</span></li>
<li><span>And I charged them, and I said to them: Why stay you
before the wall? if you do so another time, I will lay hands on
you. And from that time they came no more on the
sabbath.</span></li>
<li><span>I spoke also to the Levites that they should be purified,
and should come to keep the gates, and to sanctify the sabbath day:
for this also remember me, O my God, and spare me according to the
multitude of thy tender mercies.</span></li>
<li><span>In those days also I saw Jews that married wives, women
of Azotus, and of Ammon, and of Moab.</span></li>
<li><span>And their children spoke half in the speech of Azotus,
and could not speak the Jews' language, but they spoke according to
the language of this and that people.</span></li>
<li><span>And I chid them, and laid my curse upon them. And I beat
some of them, and shaved off their hair, and made them swear by God
that they would not give their daughters to their sons, nor take
their daughters for their sons, nor for themselves,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Did not Solomon king of Israel sin in this kind of thing?
and surely among many nations, there was not a king like him, and
he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: m
and yet women of other countries brought even him to
sin.</span></li>
<li><span>And shall we also be disobedient and do all this great
evil to transgress against our God, and marry strange
women?</span></li>
<li><span>And one of the sons of Joiada the son of Eliasib the high
priest, was son in law to Sanaballat the Horonite, and I drove him
from me.</span></li>
<li><span>Remember them, O Lord my God, that defile the priesthood,
and the law of priests and Levites.</span></li>
<li><span>So I separated from them all strangers, and I appointed
the courses of the priests and the Levites, every man in his
ministry :</span></li>
<li><span>And for the offering of wood at times appointed, and for
the firstfruits: remember me, O my God, unto good.
Amen.</span></li>
