  <h2><a name="1">Genesis 1</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>In the beginning God created heaven, and
    earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the earth was void and empty, and darkness was
    upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God moved over the
    waters.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God said: Be light made. And light was
    made.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God saw the light that it was good; and he
    divided the light from the darkness.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he called the light Day, and the darkness Night;
    and there was evening and morning one day.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God said: Let there be a firmament made amidst
    the waters: and let it divide the waters from the
    waters.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God made a firmament, and divided the waters that
    were under the firmament, from those that were above the
    firmament, and it was so.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God called the firmament, Heaven; and the evening
    and morning were the second day.</span></li>

    <li><span>God also said: Let the waters that are under the
    heaven, be gathered together into one place: and let the dry
    land appear. And it was so done.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God called the dry land, Earth; and the gathering
    together of the waters, he called Seas. And God saw that it was
    good.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said: Let the earth bring forth the green
    herb, and such as may seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit
    after its kind, which may have seed in itself upon the earth.
    And it was so done.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the earth brought forth the green herb, and such
    as yieldeth seed according to its kind, and the tree that
    beareth fruit having seed each one according to its kind. And
    God saw that it was good.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the evening and the morning were the third
    day.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God said: Let there be lights made in the
    firmament of heaven, to divide the day and the night, and let
    them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and
    years:</span></li>

    <li><span>To shine in the firmament of heaven, and to give
    light upon the earth. And it was so done.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God made two great lights: a greater light to
    rule the day; and a lesser light to rule the night: and the
    stars.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he set them in the firmament of heaven to shine
    upon the earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And to rule the day and the night, and to divide the
    light and the darkness. And God saw that it was
    good.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the evening and morning were the fourth
    day.</span></li>

    <li><span>God also said: Let the waters bring forth the
    creeping creature having life, and the fowl that may fly over
    the earth under the firmament of heaven.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God created the great whales, and every living
    and moving creature, which the waters brought forth, according
    to their kinds, and every winged fowl according to its kind.
    And God saw that it was good.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply,
    and fill the waters of the sea: and let the birds be multiplied
    upon the earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the evening and morning were the fifth
    day.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God said: Let the earth bring forth the living
    creature in its kind, cattle and creeping things, and beasts of
    the earth, according to their kinds. And it was so
    done.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God made the beasts of the earth according to
    their kinds, and cattle, and every thing that creepeth on the
    earth after its kind. And God saw that it was good.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said: Let us make man to our image and
    likeness: and let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea,
    and the fowls of the air, and the beasts, and the whole earth,
    and every creeping creature that moveth upon the
    earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God created man to his own image: to the image of
    God he created him: male and female he created
    them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply,
    and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule over the fishes of
    the sea, and the fowls of the air, and all living creatures
    that move upon the earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God said: Behold I have given you every herb
    bearing seed upon the earth, and all trees that have in
    themselves seed of their own kind, to be your meat:</span></li>

    <li><span>And to all the beasts of the earth, and to every fowl
    of the air, and to all that move upon the earth, and wherein
    there is life, that they may have to feed upon. And it was so
    done.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God saw all the things that he had made, and they
    were very good. And the evening and morning were the sixth
    day.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="2">Genesis 2</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>So the heavens and the earth were finished, and all
    the furniture of them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And on the seventh day God ended his work which he
    had made: and he rested on the seventh day from all his work
    which he had done.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it:
    because in it he had rested from all his work which God created
    and made.</span></li>

    <li><span>These are the generations of the heaven and the
    earth, when they were created, in the day that the Lord God
    made the heaven and the earth:</span></li>

    <li><span>And every plant of the field before it spring up in
    the earth, and every herb of the ground before it grew: for the
    Lord God had not rained upon the earth; and there was not a man
    to till the earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>But a spring rose out the earth, watering all the
    surface of the earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord God formed man of the slime of the
    earth: and breathed into his face the breath of life, and man
    became a living soul.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord God had planted a paradise of pleasure
    from the beginning: wherein he placed man whom he had
    formed.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord God brought forth of the ground all
    manner of trees, fair to behold, and pleasant to eat of: the
    tree of life also in the midst of paradise: and the tree of
    knowledge of good and evil.</span></li>

    <li><span>And a river went out the place of pleasure to water
    paradise, which from thence is divided into four
    heads.</span></li>

    <li><span>The name of the one is Phison: that is it which
    compasseth all the land of Hevilath, where gold
    groweth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the gold of that land is very good: there is
    found bdellium, and the onyx stone.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the name of the second river is Gehon: the same
    is it that compasseth all the land of Ethiopia</span></li>

    <li><span>And the name of the third river is Tigris: the same
    passeth along by the Assyrians. And the fourth river is
    Euphrates.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord God took man, and put him into the
    paradise for pleasure, to dress it, and keep it.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he commanded him, saying: Of every tree of
    paradise thou shalt eat:</span></li>

    <li><span>But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou
    shalt not eat. for in what day soever thou shalt eat of it,
    thou shalt die the death.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord God said: It is not good for man to be
    alone: let us make him a help like unto himself.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord God having formed out of the ground all
    the beasts of the earth, and all the fowls of the air, brought
    them to Adam to see what he would call them: for whatsoever
    Adam called any living creature the same is its
    name.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Adam called all the beasts by their names, and
    all the fowls of the air, and all the cattle of the field: but
    for Adam there was not found a helper like himself.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep upon Adam: and
    when he was fast asleep, he took one of his ribs, and filled up
    flesh for it.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord God built the rib which he took from
    Adam into a woman: and brought her to Adam.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Adam said: This now is bone of my bones, and
    flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was
    taken out of man.</span></li>

    <li><span>Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother, and
    shall cleave to his wife: and they shall be two in one
    flesh.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they were both naked: to wit, Adam and his wife:
    and were not ashamed.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="3">Genesis 3</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Now the serpent was more subtle than any of the
    beasts of the earth which the Lord God made. And he said to the
    woman: Why hath God commanded you, that you should not eat of
    every tree of paradise?</span></li>

    <li><span>And the woman answered him, saying: Of the fruit of
    the trees that are in paradise we do eat:</span></li>

    <li><span>But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of
    paradise, God hath commanded us that we should not eat; and
    that we should not touch it, lest perhaps we die.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the serpent said to the woman: No, you shall not
    die the death.</span></li>

    <li><span>For God doth know that in what day soever you shall
    eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened: and you shall be as
    Gods, knowing good and evil.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the woman saw that the tree was good to eat, and
    fair to the eyes, and delightful to behold: and she took of the
    fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave to her husband who did
    eat.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the eyes of them both were opened: and when they
    perceived themselves to be naked, they sewed together fig
    leaves, and made themselves aprons.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they heard the voice of the Lord God walking
    in paradise at the afternoon air, Adam and his wife hid
    themselves from the face of the Lord God, amidst the trees of
    paradise.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord God called Adam, and said to him: Where
    art thou?</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said: I heard thy voice in paradise; and I was
    afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to him: And who hath told thee that thou
    wast naked, but that thou hast eaten of the tree whereof I
    commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat?</span></li>

    <li><span>And Adam said: The woman, whom thou gavest me to be
    my companion, gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord God said to the woman: Why hast thou
    done this? And she answered: The serpent deceived me, and I did
    eat.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord God said to the serpent: Because thou
    hast done this thing, thou art cursed among all cattle, and the
    beasts of the earth: upon thy breast shalt thou go, and earth
    shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.</span></li>

    <li><span>I will put enmities between thee and the woman, and
    thy seed and her seed: she shall crush thy head, and thou shalt
    lie in wait for her heel.</span></li>

    <li><span>To the woman also he said: I will multiply thy
    sorrows, and thy conceptions: in sorrow shalt thou bring forth
    children, and thou shalt be under thy husband's power, and he
    shall have dominion over thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>And to Adam he said: Because thou hast hearkened to
    the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, whereof I
    commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat, cursed is the earth
    in thy work; with labour and toil shalt thou eat thereof all
    the days of thy life.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and
    thou eat the herbs of the earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till
    thou return to the earth, out of which thou wast taken: for
    dust thou art, and into dust thou shalt return.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Adam called the name of his wife Eve: because she
    was the mother of all the living.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord God made for Adam and his wife, garments
    of skins, and clothed them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said: Behold Adam is become as one of us,
    knowing good and evil: now, therefore, lest perhaps he put
    forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and
    live for ever.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord God sent him out of the paradise of
    pleasure, to till the earth from which he was
    taken.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he cast out Adam; and placed before the paradise
    of pleasure Cherubims, and a flaming sword, turning every way,
    to keep the way of the tree of life.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="4">Genesis 4</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And Adam knew Eve his wife: who conceived and brought
    forth Cain, saying: I have gotten a man through
    God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And again she brought forth his brother Abel. And
    Abel was a shepherd, and Cain a husbandman.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it came to pass after many days, that Cain
    offered, of the fruits of the earth, gifts to the
    Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>Abel also offered of the firstlings of his flock, and
    of their fat: and the Lord had respect to Abel, and to his
    offerings.</span></li>

    <li><span>But to Cain and his offerings he had no respect: and
    Cain was exceedingly angry, and his countenance
    fell.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to him: Why art thou angry? and why
    is thy countenance fallen?</span></li>

    <li><span>If thou do well, shalt thou not receive? but if ill,
    shall not sin forthwith be present at the door? but the lust
    thereof shall be under thee, and thou shalt have dominion over
    it.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Cain said to Abel his brother: Let us go forth
    abroad. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against
    his brother Abel, and slew him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Cain: Where is thy brother Abel?
    And he answered, I know not: am I my brother's
    keeper?</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to him: What hast thou done? the voice of
    thy brother's blood crieth to me from the earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now, therefore, cursed shalt thou be upon the earth,
    which hath opened her mouth and received the blood of thy
    brother at thy hand,</span></li>

    <li><span>When thou shalt till it, it shall not yield to thee
    its fruit: a fugitive and vagabond shalt thou be upon the
    earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Cain said to the Lord: My iniquity is greater
    than that I may deserve pardon.</span></li>

    <li><span>Behold thou dost cast me out this day from the face
    of the earth, and I shall be hidden from thy face, and I shall
    be a vagabond and a fugitive on the earth: everyone, therefore,
    that findeth me, shall kill me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to him: No, it shall not be so: but
    whosoever shall kill Cain, shall be punished sevenfold. And the
    Lord set a mark upon Cain, that whosoever found him should not
    kill him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Cain went out from the face of the Lord, and
    dwelt as a fugitive on the earth, at the east side of
    Eden.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and
    brought forth Henoch: and he built a city, and called the name
    thereof by the name of his son Henoch.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Henoch begot Irad, and Irad begot Maviael, and
    Maviael begot Mathusael, and Mathusael begot
    Lamech:</span></li>

    <li><span>Who took two wives: the name of the one was Ada, and
    the name of the other was Sella.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Ada brought forth Jabel: who was the father of
    such as dwell in tents, and of herdsmen.</span></li>

    <li><span>And his brother's name was Jubal; he was the father
    of them that play upon the harp and the organs.</span></li>

    <li><span>Sella also brought forth Tubalcain, who was a
    hammerer and artificer in every work of brass and iron. And the
    sister of Tubalcain was Noema.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Lamech said to his wives Ada and Sell: Hear my
    voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech: for I have
    slain a man to the wounding of myself, and a stripling to my
    own bruising.</span></li>

    <li><span>Sevenfold vengeance shall be taken for Cain: but for
    Lamech seventy times sevenfold.</span></li>

    <li><span>Adam also knew his wife again: and she brought forth
    a son, and called his name Seth, saying: God hath given me
    another seed, for Abel whom Cain slew.</span></li>

    <li><span>But to Seth also was born a son, whom he called Enos;
    this man began to call upon the name of the Lord.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="5">Genesis 5</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>This is the book of the generation of Adam. In the
    day that God created man, he made him to the likeness of
    God.</span></li>

    <li><span>He created them male and female; and blessed them:
    and called their name Adam, in the day when they were
    created.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begot
    a son to his own image and likeness, and called his name
    Seth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the days of Adam, after he begot Seth, were eight
    hundred years: and he begot sons and daughters.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the time that Adam lived came to nine hundred
    and thirty years, and he died.</span></li>

    <li><span>Seth also lived a hundred and five years, and begot
    Enos.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Seth lived after he begot Enos, eight hundred and
    seven years, and begot sons and daughters.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve
    years, and he died.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Enos lived ninety years, and begot
    Cainan.</span></li>

    <li><span>After whose birth he lived eight hundred and fifteen
    years, and begot sons and daughters.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the days of Enos were nine hundred and five
    years, and he died.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Cainan lived seventy years, and begot
    Malaleel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Cainan lived after he begot Malaleel, eight
    hundred forty years, and begot sons and daughters.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten
    years, and he died.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Malaleel lived sixty-five years, and begot
    Jared.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Malaleel lived after he begot Jared, eight
    hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and
    daughters.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the days of Malaleel were eight hundred and
    ninety-five years, and he died.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jared lived a hundred and sixty-two years, and
    begot Henoch.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jared lived after he begot Henoch, eight hundred
    years, and begot sons and daughters.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the days of Jared were nine hundred and
    sixty-two years, and he died.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Henoch lived sixty-five years, and begot
    Mathusala.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Henoch walked with God: and lived after he begot
    Mathusala, three hundred years, and begot sons and
    daughters.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the days of Henoch were three hundred and
    sixty-five years.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he walked with God, and was seen no more: because
    God took him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Mathusala lived a hundred and eighty-seven years,
    and begot Lamech.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Mathusala lived after he begot Lamech, seven
    hundred and eighty-two years, and begot sons and
    daughters.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the days of Mathusala were nine hundred and
    sixty-nine years, and he died.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Lamech lived a hundred and eighty-two years, and
    begot a son.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he called his name Noe, saying: This same shall
    comfort us from the works and labours of our hands on the earth
    which the Lord hath cursed.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Lamech lived after he begot Noe, five hundred and
    ninety-five years, and he begot sons and daughters.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the days of Lamech came to seven hundred and
    seventy-seven years, and he died. And Noe, when he was five
    hundred years old, begot Sem, Cham, and Japheth.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="6">Genesis 6</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And after that men began to be multiplied upon the
    earth, and daughters were born to them.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of God seeing the daughters of men, that
    they were fair, took themselves wives of all which they
    chose.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God said: My spirit shall not remain in man for
    ever, because he is flesh, and his days shall be a hundred and
    twenty years.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now giants were upon the earth in those days. For
    after the sons of God went in to the daughters of men and they
    brought forth children, these are the mighty men of old, men of
    renown.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God seeing that the wickedness of men was great
    on the earth, and that all the thought of their heart was bent
    upon evil at all times,</span></li>

    <li><span>It repented him that he had made man on the earth.
    And being touched inwardly with sorrow of heart,</span></li>

    <li><span>He said: I will destroy man, whom I have created,
    from the face of the earth, from man even to beasts, from the
    creeping thing even to the fowls of the air, for it repenteth
    me that I have made them.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Noe found grace before the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>These are the generations of Noe: Noe was a just and
    perfect man in his generations, he walked with God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he begot three sons, Sem, Cham, and
    Japheth.\</span></li>

    <li><span>And the earth was corrupted before God, and was
    filled with iniquity.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when God had seen that the earth was corrupted
    (for all flesh had corrupted its way upon the
    earth,)</span></li>

    <li><span>He said to Noe: The end of all flesh is come before
    me, the earth is filled with iniquity through them, and I will
    destroy them with the earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>Make thee an ark of timber planks: thou shalt make
    little rooms in the ark, and thou shalt pitch it within and
    without.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thus shalt thou make it: The length of the ark
    shall be three hundred cubits: the breadth of it fifty cubits,
    and the height of it thirty cubits.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt make a window in the ark, and in a cubit
    shalt thou finish the top of it: and the door of the ark thou
    shalt set in the side: with lower, middle chambers, and third
    stories shalt thou make it.</span></li>

    <li><span>Behold I will bring the waters of a great flood upon
    the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life,
    under heaven. All things that are in the earth shall be
    consumed.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I will establish my covenant with thee, and thou
    shalt enter into the ark, thou and thy sons, and thy wife, and
    the wives of thy sons with thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>And of every living creature of all flesh, thou shalt
    bring two of each sort into the ark, that they may live with
    thee: of the male sex, and the female.</span></li>

    <li><span>Of fowls according to their kind, and of beasts in
    their kind, and of every thing that creepeth on earth according
    to its kind; two of every sort shall go in with thee, that they
    may live.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt take unto thee of all food that may be
    eaten, and thou shalt lay it up with thee: and it shall be food
    for thee and them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Noe did all things which God commanded
    him.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="7">Genesis 7</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And the Lord said to him: Go in thou and all thy
    house into the ark: for thee I have seen just before me in this
    generation.</span></li>

    <li><span>Of all clean beasts take seven and seven, the male
    and female.</span></li>

    <li><span>But of the beasts that are unclean two and two, the
    male and female. Of the fowls also of the air seven and
    seven,the male and the female: that seed may be saved upon the
    face of the whole earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>For yet a while, and after seven days, I will rain
    upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and I will destroy
    every substance that I have made, from the face of the
    earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Noe did all things which the Lord had commanded
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he was six hundred years old, when the waters of
    the flood overflowed the earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Noe went in and his sons, his wife and the wives
    of his sons with him into the ark, because of the waters of the
    flood.</span></li>

    <li><span>And of the beasts clean and unclean, and of fowls,
    and of every thing that moveth upon the earth,</span></li>

    <li><span>Two and two went in to Noe into the ark, male and
    female, as the Lord had commanded Noe.</span></li>

    <li><span>And after seven days were passed, the waters of the
    flood overflowed the earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>In the six hundreth year of the life of Noe in the
    second month, in the seventeenth day of the month, all the
    fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the flood gates
    of heaven were open:</span></li>

    <li><span>And the rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty
    nights.</span></li>

    <li><span>In the selfsame day Noe, and Sem, and Cham, and
    Japheth his sons: his wife, and the three wives of his sons
    with them, went into the ark:</span></li>

    <li><span>They and every beast according to its kind, and all
    the cattle in their kind, and every thing that moveth upon the
    earth according to its kind, and every fowl according to its
    kind, and every fowl according to its kind, all birds, and all
    that fly.</span></li>

    <li><span>Went in to Noe into the ark, two and two of all
    flesh, wherein was the breath of life.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they that went in, went in male and female of all
    flesh, as God had commanded him: and the Lord shut him in on
    the outside.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the flood was forty days upon the earth, and the
    waters increased, and lifted up the ark on high from
    earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>For they overflowed exceedingly: and filled all on
    the face of the earth: and the ark was carried upon the
    waters.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the waters prevailed beyond measure upon the
    earth: and all the high mountains under the whole heaven were
    covered.</span></li>

    <li><span>The water was fifteen cubits higher than the
    mountains which it covered.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all flesh was destroyed that moved upon the
    earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beasts, and of all
    creeping things that creep upon the earth: and all
    men.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all things wherein there is the breath of life on
    the earth, died.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he destroyed all the substance that was upon the
    earth, from man to beast, and the creeping things and fowls of
    the air: and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noe only
    remained, and they that were with him in the ark.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and
    fifty days.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="8">Genesis 8</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And God remembered Noe, and all the living creatures,
    and all the cattle which were with him in the ark, and brought
    a wind upon the earth, and the waters were abated.</span></li>

    <li><span>The fountains also of the deep, and the flood gates
    of heaven were shut up, and the rain from heaven was
    restrained.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the waters returned from off the earth going and
    coming: and they began to be abated after a hundred and fifty
    days.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the ark rested in the seventh month, the seven
    and twentieth day of the month, upon the mountains of
    Armenia.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the waters were going and decreasing until the
    tenth month: for in the tenth month, the first day of the
    month, the tops of the mountains appeared.</span></li>

    <li><span>And after that forty days were passed, Noe, opening
    the window of the ark which he had made, sent forth a
    raven:</span></li>

    <li><span>Which went forth and did not return, till the waters
    were dried up upon the earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>He sent forth also a dove after him, to see if the
    waters had now ceased upon the face of the earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>But she, not finding where her foot might rest,
    returned to him into the ark: for the waters were upon the
    whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and caught her, and
    brought her into the ark.</span></li>

    <li><span>And having waited yet seven other days, he again sent
    forth the dove out of the ark.</span></li>

    <li><span>And she came to him in the evening, carrying a bough
    of an olive tree, with green leaves, in her mouth. Noe
    therefore understood that the waters were ceased upon the
    earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he stayed yet other seven days: and he sent forth
    the dove, which returned not any more unto him.</span></li>

    <li><span>Therefore in the six hundreth and first year, the
    first month, the first day of the month, the waters were
    lessened upon the earth, and Noe opening the covering of the
    ark, looked, and saw that the face of the earth was
    dried.</span></li>

    <li><span>In the second month, the seven and twentieth day of
    the month, the earth was dried.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God spoke to Noe, saying:</span></li>

    <li><span>Go out of the ark, thou and thy wife, thy sons, and
    the wives of thy sons with thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>All livings things that are with thee of all flesh,
    as well in fowls as in beasts, and all creeping things that
    creep upon the earth, bring out with thee, and go ye upon the
    earth: increased and multiply upon it.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Noe went out, he and his sons: his wife, and the
    wives of his sons with him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all living things, and cattle, and creeping
    things that creep upon the earth, according to their kinds,
    went out of the ark.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Noe built an altar unto the Lord: and taking of
    all cattle and fowls that were clean, offered holocausts upon
    the altar.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord smelled a sweet savour, and said: I will
    no more curse the earth for the sake of man: for the
    imagination and thought of man's heart are prone to evil from
    his youth: therefore I will no more destroy every living soul
    as I have done.</span></li>

    <li><span>All the days of the earth, seedtime and harvest, cold
    and heat, summer and winter, night and day, shall not
    cease.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="9">Genesis 9</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And God blessed Noe and his sons. And he said to
    them: Increase and multiply, and fill the earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And let the fear and dread of you be upon all the
    beasts of the earth, and upon all the fowls of the air, and all
    that move upon the earth: all the fishes of the sea are
    delivered into your hand.</span></li>

    <li><span>And every thing that moveth and liveth shall be meat
    for you: even as the green herbs have I delivered them all to
    you:</span></li>

    <li><span>Saving that flesh with blood you shall not
    eat.</span></li>

    <li><span>For I will require the blood of your lives at the
    hand of every beast, and at the hand of man, at the hand of
    every man, and of his brother, will I require the life of
    man.</span></li>

    <li><span>Whosoever shall shed man's blood, his blood shall be
    shed: for man was made to the image of God.</span></li>

    <li><span>But increase you and multiply, and go upon the earth,
    and fill it.</span></li>

    <li><span>This also said God to Noe, and to his sons with
    him,</span></li>

    <li><span>Behold I will establish my covenant with you, and
    with your seed after you:</span></li>

    <li><span>And with every living soul that is with you, as well
    in all birds as in cattle and beasts of the earth, that are
    come forth out of the ark, and in all the beasts of the
    earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>I will establish my covenant with you, and all flesh
    shall be no more destroyed with the waters of a flood, neither
    shall there be from henceforth a flood to waste the
    earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God said: This is the sign of the covenant which
    I will give between me and you, and to every living soul that
    is with you, for perpetual generations.</span></li>

    <li><span>I will set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be the
    sign of a covenant between me, and between the
    earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when I shall cover the sky with clouds, my bow
    shall appear in the clouds:</span></li>

    <li><span>And I will remember my covenant with you, and with
    every living soul that beareth flesh: and there shall no more
    be waters of a flood to destroy all flesh.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the bow shall be in the clouds, and I shall see
    it, and shall remember the everlasting covenant, that was made
    between God and every living soul of all flesh which is upon
    the earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God said to Noe: This shall be the sign of the
    covenant which I have established between me and all flesh upon
    the earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the sons of Noe who came out of the ark, were
    Sem, Cham, and Japheth: and Cham is the father of
    Chanaan.</span></li>

    <li><span>These three are the sons of Noe: and from these was
    all mankind spread over the whole earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Noe, a husbandman, began to till the ground, and
    planted a vineyard.</span></li>

    <li><span>And drinking of the wine was made drunk, and was
    uncovered in his tent.</span></li>

    <li><span>Which when Cham the father of Chaanan had seen, to
    wit, that his father's nakedness was uncovered, he told it to
    his two brethren without.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Sem and Japheth put a cloak upon their shoulders,
    and going backward, covered the nakedness of their father: and
    their faces were turned away, and they saw not their father's
    nakedness.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Noe awaking from the wine, when he had learned
    what his younger son had done to him,</span></li>

    <li><span>He said: Cursed be Chaanan, a servant of servants,
    shall he be unto his brethren.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said: Blessed be the Lord God of Sem, be
    Chanaan his servant.</span></li>

    <li><span>May God enlarge Japheth, and may he dwell in the
    tents of Sem, and Chanaan be his servant.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Noe lived after the flood three hundred and fifty
    years:</span></li>

    <li><span>And all his days were in the whole nine hundred and
    fifty years: and he died.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="10">Genesis 10</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>These are the generations of the sons of Noe: Sem,
    Cham, and Japheth: and unto them sons were born after the
    flood.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and
    Javan, and Thubal, and Mosoch, and Thiras.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the sons of Gomer: Ascenez and Riphath and
    Thogorma.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the sons of Javan: Elisa and Tharsis, Cetthim,
    and Dodanim.</span></li>

    <li><span>By these were divided the islands of the Gentiles in
    their lands, every one according to his tongue and their
    families in their nations.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the sons of Cham: Chus, and Mesram, and Phuth,
    and Chanaan.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the sons of Chus: Saba and Hevila, and Sabatha,
    and Regma, and Sabatacha. The sons of Regma: Saba and
    Dadan.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now Chus begot Nemrod: he began to be mighty on
    earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he was a stout hunter before the Lord. Hence came
    a proverb: Even as Nemrod the stout hunter before the
    Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the beginning of his kingdom was Babylon, and
    Arach, and Achad, and Chalanne in the land of
    Sennaar.</span></li>

    <li><span>Out of that land came forth Assur, and built Ninive,
    and the streets of the city, and Chale.</span></li>

    <li><span>Resen also between Ninive and Chale: this is the
    great city.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Mesraim begot Ludim, and Anamim, and Laabim,
    Nepthuim,</span></li>

    <li><span>And Phetrusim, and Chasluim; of whom came forth the
    Philistines, and the Capthorim.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Chanaan begot Sidon, his firstborn, the
    Hethite,</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Jebusite, and the Amorrhite, and the
    Gergesite,</span></li>

    <li><span>The Hevite and the Aracite: the Sinite,</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Aradian, the Samarite, and the Hamathite: and
    afterwards the families of the Chanaanites were spread
    abroad.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the limits of Chanaan were from Sidon as one
    comes to Gerara even to Gaza, until thou enter Sodom and
    Gomorrha, and Adama, and Seboim even to Lesa.</span></li>

    <li><span>These are the children of Cham in their kindreds, and
    tongues, and generations, and lands, and nations.</span></li>

    <li><span>Of Sem also, the father of all children of Heber, the
    elder brother of Japheth, sons were born.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Sem: Elam and Assur, and Arphaxad, and
    Lud, and Aram.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Aram: Us and Hull, and Gether: and
    Mess.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Arphaxad begot Sale, of whom was born
    Heber.</span></li>

    <li><span>And to Heber were born two sons: the name of the one
    was Phaleg, because in his days the earth was divided: and his
    brother's name Jectan.</span></li>

    <li><span>Which Jectan begot Elmodad, and Saleph, and Asarmoth,
    Jare,</span></li>

    <li><span>And Anduram, and Uzal, and Decla,</span></li>

    <li><span>And Ebal, and Abimael, Saba,</span></li>

    <li><span>And Ophir, and Hevila, and Jobab.</span></li>

    <li><span>And their dwelling was from Messa as we go on as far
    as Sephar, a mountain in the east.</span></li>

    <li><span>These are the children of Sem according to their
    kindreds and tongues, and countries in their
    nations.</span></li>

    <li><span>These are the families of Noe, according to their
    peoples and nations. By these were the nations divided on the
    earth after the flood.</span></li>

  <h2><a name="11">Genesis 11</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And the earth was of one tongue, and of the same
    speech.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they removed from the east, they found a
    plain in the land of Sennaar, and dwelt in it.</span></li>

    <li><span>And each one said to his neighbour: Come, let us make
    brick, and bake them of stones, and slime instead of
    mortar.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they said: Come, let us make a city and a tower,
    the top whereof may reach to heaven: and let us make our name
    famous before we be scattered abroad into all
    lands.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower,
    which the children of Adam were building.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said: Behold, it is one people, and all have
    one tongue: and they have begun to do this, neither will they
    leave off from their designs, till they accomplish them in
    deed.</span></li>

    <li><span>Come ye, therefore, let us go down, and there may not
    understand one another's speech.</span></li>

    <li><span>And so the Lord scattered them from that place into
    all lands, and they ceased to build the city.</span></li>

    <li><span>And therefore the name thereof was called Babel,
    because there the language of the whole earth was confounded:
    and from thence the Lord scattered them abroad upon the face of
    all countries.</span></li>

    <li><span>These are the generations of Sem: Sem was a hundred
    years old when he begot Arphaxad, two years old when he begot
    Arphaxad, two years after the flood.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Sem lived after he begot Arphaxad, five hundred
    years, and begot sons and daughters.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Reu lived after he begot Sarug, two hundred and
    seven years, and begot sons and daughters.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Sarug lived thirty years, and begot

    <li><span>I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them
    that curse thee, and IN THEE shall all the kindred of the earth
    be blessed:</span></li>

    <li><span>So Abram went out as the Lord had commanded him, and
    Lot went with him: Abram was seventy-five years old when he
    went forth from Haran.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's
    son, and all the substance which they had gathered, and the
    souls which they had gotten in Haran: and they went out to go
    into the land of Chanaan. And when they were come into
    it,</span></li>

    <li><span>Abram passed through the country into the place of
    Sichem, as far as the noble vale: now the Chanaanite was at
    that time in the land.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord appeared to Abram, and said to him: To
    thy seed will I give this land. And he built there an altar to
    the Lord, who had appeared to him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And passing on from thence to a mountain, that was on
    the east side of Bethel, he there pitched his tent, having
    Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east; he built there also an
    altar to the Lord, and called upon his name.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Abram went forward, going, and proceeding on to
    the south.</span></li>

    <li><span>And there came a famine in the country; and Abram
    went down into Egypt, to sojourn there: for the famine was very
    grievous in the land.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he was near to enter into Egypt, he said to
    Sarai his wife: I know that thou art a beautiful
    woman:</span></li>

    <li><span>And that when the Egyptians shall see thee, they will
    say: She is his wife: and they will kill me, and keep
    thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>Say, therefore, I pray thee, that thou art my sister:
    that I may be well used for thee, and that my soul may live for
    thy sake.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians saw
    the woman that she was very beautiful.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the princes told Pharao, and praised her before
    him: and the woman was taken into the house of
    Pharao.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they used Abram well for her sake. And he had
    sheep and oxen, and he asses, and menservants and maidservants,
    and she asses, and camels.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the Lord scourged Pharao and his house with most
    grievous stripes for Sarai, Abram's wife.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Pharao called Abram, and said to him: What is
    this that thou hast done to me? Why didst thou not tell me that
    she was thy wife.</span></li>

    <li><span>For what cause didst thou say, she was thy sister,
    that I might take her to my wife? Now therefore, there is thy
    wife, take her, and go thy way.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Pharao gave his men orders concerning Abram: and
    they led him away, and his wife, and all that he
    had.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="13">Genesis 13</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And Abram went up out of Egypt, he and his wife, and
    all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he was very rich in possession of gold and
    silver.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he returned by the way that he came, from the
    south to Bethel, to the place where before he had pitched his
    tent between Bethel and Hai:</span></li>

    <li><span>In the place of the altar which he had made before;
    and there he called upon the name of the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Lot also, who was with Abram, had flocks of
    sheep, and herds of beasts, and tents.</span></li>

    <li><span>Neither was the land able to bear them, that they
    might dwell together: for their substance was great, and they
    could not dwell together.</span></li>

    <li><span>Whereupon also there arose a strife between the
    herdsmen of Abram and of Lot. And at that time the Chanaanite
    and the Pherezite dwelled in that country.</span></li>

    <li><span>Abram therefore said to Lot: Let there be no quarrel,
    I beseech thee, between me and thee, and between my herdsmen
    and thy herdsmen: for we are brethren.</span></li>

    <li><span>Behold the whole land is before thee: depart from me
    I pray thee: if thou wilt go to the left hand, I will take the
    right: if thou choose the right hand, I will pass to the
    left.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Lot, lifting up his eyes, saw all the country
    about the Jordan, which was watered throughout, before the Lord
    destroyed Sodom and Gomorrha, as the paradise of the Lord, and
    like Egypt as one comes to Segor.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Lot chose to himself the country about the
    Jordan, and he departed from the east: and they were separated
    one brother from the other.</span></li>

    <li><span>Abram dwelt in the land of Chanaan; and Lot abode in
    the towns that were about the Jordan, and dwelt in
    Sodom.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the men of Sodom were very wicked, and sinners
    before the face of the Lord, beyond measure.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Abram, after Lot was separated
    from him: Lift up thy eyes, and look from the place wherein
    thou now art, to the north and to the south, to the east and to
    the west.</span></li>

    <li><span>All the land which thou seest, I will give to thee,
    and to thy seed for ever.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: if
    any man be able to number the dust of the earth, he shall be
    able to number thy seed also.</span></li>

    <li><span>Arise and walk through the land in the length, and in
    the breadth thereof: for I will give it to thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Abram removing his tent came and dwelt by the vale
    of Mambre, which is in Hebron: and he built there an altar to
    the Lord.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="14">Genesis 14</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And it came to pass at that time, that Amraphel king
    of Sennaar, and Arioch king of Pontus, and Chodorlahomor king
    of the Elamites, and Thadal king of nations,</span></li>

    <li><span>Made war against Bara king of Sodom, and against
    Bersa king of Gomorrha, and against Sennaab king of Adama, and
    against Semeber king of Seboim, and against the king of Bala,
    which is Segor.</span></li>

    <li><span>All these came together into the woodland vale, which
    now is the salt sea.</span></li>

    <li><span>For they had served Chodorlahomor twelve years, and
    in the thirteenth year they revolted from him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And in the fourteenth year came Chodorlahomor, and
    the kings that were with him: and they smote the Raphaim in
    Astarothcarnaim, and the Zuzim with them, and the Emim in Save
    of Cariathaim.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Chorreans in the mountains of Seir, even to
    the plains of Pharan, which is in the wilderness.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they returned, and came to the fountain of
    Misphat, the same is Cades: and they smote all the country of
    the Amalecites, and the Amorrhean that dwelt in
    Asasonthamar.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrha, and
    the king of Adama, and the king of Seboim, and the king of
    Bala, which is Segor, went out: and they set themselves against
    them in battle array in the woodland vale:</span></li>

    <li><span>To wit, against Chodorlahomor king of the Elamites,
    and Thadal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Sennaar, and
    Arioch king of Pontus: four kings against five.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now the woodland vale had many pits of slime. And the
    king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrha turned their backs and
    were overthrown there: and they that remained fled to the
    mountain.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they took all the substance of the Sodomites, and
    Gomorrhites, and all their victuals, and went their
    way:</span></li>

    <li><span>And Lot also, the son of Abram's brother, who dwelt
    in Sodom, and his substance.</span></li>

    <li><span>And behold one that had escaped told Abram the
    Hebrew, who dwelt in the vale of Mambre the Amorrhite, the
    brother of Escol, and the brother of Aner: for these had made
    league with Abram.</span></li>

    <li><span>Which when Abram had heard, to wit, that his brother
    Lot was taken, he numbered of the servants born in his house,
    three hundred and eighteen well appointed: and pursued them to
    Dan.</span></li>

    <li><span>And dividing his company, he rushed upon them in the
    night: and defeated them, and pursued them as far as Hoba,
    which is on the left hand of Damascus.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he brought back all the substance, and Lot his
    brother, with his substance, the women also the
    people.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after he
    returned from the slaughter of Chodorlahomor, and of the kings
    that were with him in the vale of Save, which is the king's
    vale.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Melchisedech the king of Salem, bringing forth
    bread and wine, for he was the priest of the most high
    God,</span></li>

    <li><span>Blessed him, and said: Blessed be Abram by the most
    high God, who created heaven and earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And blessed be the most high God, by whose protection
    the enemies are in thy hands. And he gace him the tithes of
    all.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the king of Sodom said to Abram: Give me the
    persons, and the rest take to thyself.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he answered him: I lift up my hand to the Lord
    God the most high, the possessor of heaven and
    earth,</span></li>

    <li><span>That from the very woof thread unto the shoe latchet,
    I will not take of any things that are thine, lest thou say I
    have enriched Abram:</span></li>

    <li><span>Except such things as the young men have eaten, and
    the shares of the men that came with me, Aner, Escol, and
    Mambre: these shall take their shares.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="15">Genesis 15</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Now when these things were done, the word of the Lord
    came to Abram by a vision, saying: Fear not, Abram, I am thy
    protector, and thy reward exceeding great.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Abram said: Lord God, what wilt thou give me? I
    shall go without children: and the son of the steward of my
    house is this Damascus Eliezer.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Abram added: But to me thou hast not given seed:
    and lo my servant, born in my house, shall be my
    heir.</span></li>

    <li><span>And immediately the word of the Lord came to him,
    saying: He shall not be thy heir: but he that shall come out of
    thy bowels, him shalt thou have for thy heir.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he thought him forth abroad, and said to him:
    Look up to heaven and number the stars, if thou canst. And he
    said to him: So shall thy seed be.</span></li>

    <li><span>Abram believed God, and it was reputed to him unto
    justice.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to him: I am the Lord who brought thee
    out from Ur of the Chaldees, to gibe thee this land, and that
    thou mightest possess it.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he said: Lord God, whereby may I know that I
    shall possess it?</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord answered, and said: Take me a cow of
    three years old, and a she goat of three years, and a ram of
    three years, a turtle also, and a pigeon.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he took all these, and divided them in the midst,
    and laid the two pieces of each one against the other; but the
    birds he divided not.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the fowls came down upon carcasses, and Abram
    drove them away.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the sun was setting, a deep sleep fell upon
    Abram, and a great and darksome horror seized upon
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it was said unto him: Know thou beforehand that
    thy seed shall be a stranger in a land not their own, and they
    shall bring them under bondage, and afflict them four hundred
    years.</span></li>

    <li><span>But I will judge the nation which they shall serve,
    and after this they shall come out with great
    substance.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace, and be
    buried in a good old age.</span></li>

    <li><span>But in the fourth generation they shall return
    hither: for as yet the iniquities of the Amorrhites are not at
    the full until this present time.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the sun was set, there arose a dark mist,
    and there appeared a smoking furnace and a lamp of fire passing
    between those divisions.</span></li>

    <li><span>That day God made a covenant with Abram, saying: To
    thy seed will I give this land, from the river of Egypt even to
    the great river Euphrates.</span></li>

    <li><span>The Cineans and Cenezites, the
    Cedmonites,</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Hethites, and the Pherezites, the Raphaim
    also,</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Amorrhites, and the Chanaanits, and the
    Gergesites, and the Jebusites. t</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="16">Genesis 16</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Now Sarai the wife of Abram, had brought forth no
    children; having a handmaid, an Egyptian, named
    Agar,</span></li>

    <li><span>She said to her husband: Behold, the Lord hath
    restrained me from bearing: go in unto my handmaid, it may be I
    may have children of her at least. And when he agreed to her
    request,</span></li>

    <li><span>She took Agar the Egyptian her handmaid, ten years
    after they first dwelt in the land of Chanaan, and gave her to
    her husband to wife.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he went in to her. But she, perceiving that she
    was with child, despised her mistress.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Sarai said to Abram: Thou dost unjustly with me:
    I gave my handmaid into thy bosom, and she perceiving herself
    to be with child, despiseth me. The Lord judge between me and
    thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Abram made answer, and said to her: Behold thy
    handmaid is in thy own hand, use her its it pleaseth thee. And
    when Sarai afflicted her, she ran away.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the angel of the Lord having found her, by a
    fountain of water in the wilderness, which is in the way to Sur
    in the desert,</span></li>

    <li><span>He said to her: Agar, handmaid of Sarai, whence
    comest thou? and whither goest thou? And she answered: I flee
    from the face of Sarai, my mistress.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the angel of the Lord said to her: Return to thy
    mistress, and humble thyself under her hand.</span></li>

    <li><span>And again he said: I will multiply thy seed
    exceedingly, and it shall not be numbered for
    multitude.</span></li>

    <li><span>And again: Behold, said he, thou art with child, and
    thou shalt bring forth a son: and thou shalt call his name
    Ismael, because the Lord hath heard thy affliction.</span></li>

    <li><span>He shall be a wild man: his hand will be against all
    men, and all men's hands against him: and he shall pitch his
    tents over against all his brethren.</span></li>

    <li><span>And she called the name of the Lord that spoke unto
    her: Thou the God who hast seen me. For she said: Verily here
    have I seen the hinder parts of him that seeth me.</span></li>

    <li><span>Therefore she called that well, The well of him that
    liveth and seeth me. The same is between Cades and
    Bared.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Agar brought forth a son to Abram: who called his
    name Ismael.</span></li>

    <li><span>Abram was fourscore and six years old when Agar
    brought him forth Ismael.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="17">Genesis 17</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And after he began to be ninety and nine years old,
    the Lord appeared to him: and said unto him: I am the Almighty
    God: walk before me, and be perfect.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I will make my covenant between me and thee: and
    I will multiply thee exceedingly.</span></li>

    <li><span>Abram tell flat on his face.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God said to him: I AM, and my covenant is with
    thee, and thou shalt be a father. of many nations.</span></li>

    <li><span>Neither shall thy name be called any more Abram: but
    thou shalt be called Abraham: because I have made thee a father
    of many nations.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I will make thee increase, exceedingly, and I
    will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of
    thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I will establish my covenant between me and thee,
    and between thy sad after thee in their generations, by a
    perpetual covenant: to be a God to thee, and to thy seed after
    thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I will give to thee, and to thy seed, the land of
    thy sojournment, all the land of Chanaan for a perpetual
    possession, and I will be their God.</span></li>

    <li><span>Again God said to Abraham: And thou therefore shalt
    keep my covenant, and thy seed after thee in their
    generations.</span></li>

    <li><span>This is my covenant which you shall observe, between
    me and you, and thy seed after thee: All the male kind of you
    shall be circumcised:</span></li>

    <li><span>And you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin,
    that it may be for a h sign of the covenant between me and
    you.</span></li>

    <li><span>An infant of eight days old shall be circumcised
    among you, every man child in your generations: he that is born
    in the house, as well as the bought servant shall be
    circumcised, and whosoever is not of your stock:</span></li>

    <li><span>And my covenant shall be in your flesh for a
    perpetual covenant.</span></li>

    <li><span>The male, whose dash of his foreskin shall not be
    circumcised, that soul shall be destroyed out of his people:
    because he hath broken my covenant.</span></li>

    <li><span>God said also to Abraham: Sarai thy wife thou shalt
    not call Sarai, but Sara.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I will bless her, and of her I will give thee a
    son, whom I will bless, and he shell become nations, and kings
    of people shall spring from him.</span></li>

    <li><span>Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, saying in
    his heart: Shall a son, thinkest thou, be born to him that is a
    hundred years old? and shall Sara that is ninety years old
    bring forth?</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to God: O that Ismael may live before
    thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God said to Abraham: Sara thy wife shall bear
    thee a son, and thou shalt call his name Isaac, and I will
    establish my covenant with him for a perpetual covenant, and
    with his seed after him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And as for Ismael I have also heard thee. Behold, I
    will bless him, and increase, and multiply him exceedingly: he
    shall beget twelve chiefs, and I will make him a great
    nation.</span></li>

    <li><span>But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom
    Sara shall bring forth to thee at this time in the next
    year.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had left oil speaking with him, God went
    up from Abraham.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Abraham took Ismael his son, and all that were
    born in his house: and all whom he had bought, every male among
    the men of his house: and he circumcised the flesh of their
    foreskin forthwith the very same day, as God had commanded
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>Abraham was ninety and nine years old, when he
    circumcised the flesh of his foreskin.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Ismael his son was full thirteen years old at the
    time of his circumcision.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the men of his house, as well they that were
    born in his house, as the bought servants and strangers were
    circumcised with him.</span></li>

    <li><span>The selfsame day was Abraham circumcised and Ismael
    his son.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="18">Genesis 18</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And the Lord appeared to him in the vale of Mambre as
    he was sitting at the door of his tent, in the very heat of the
    day.</span></li>

    <li><span>and my lord is an old man, shall I give myself to
    pleasure?</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had lifted up his eyes, there appeared to
    him three men standing near him: and as soon as he saw them he
    ran to meet them from the door of his tent, and adored down to
    the ground.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said: Lord, if I have found favour in thy
    sight, pass not away from thy servant:</span></li>

    <li><span>But I will fetch a little water, and wash ye your
    feet, and rest ye under the tree.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I will set a morsel of bread, and strengthen ye
    your heart, afterwards you shall pass on: for therefore are you
    come aside to your servant. And they said: Do as thou hast
    spoken.</span></li>

    <li><span>Abraham made haste into the tent to Sera, and said to
    her: Make haste, temper together three measures of flour, and
    make cakes upon the hearth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he himself ran to the herd, and took from thence
    a calf very tender and very good, and gave it to a young man:
    who made haste and boiled it.</span></li>

    <li><span>He took also butter and milk, and the calf which he
    had boiled, and set before them: but he stood by them under the
    tree.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they had eaten, they said to him: Where is
    Sara thy wife? He answered: Lo, she is in the tent.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to him: I will return and come to thee at
    this time, life accompanying and Sara thy wife shall have a
    son. Which when Sara heard, she laughed behind the door of the
    tent.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now they were both old, and far advanced in years,
    and it had ceased to be with Sara after the manner of
    women.</span></li>

    <li><span>And she laughed secretly, saying: After I am grown
    old</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Abraham: Why did Sera laugh,
    saying: Shall I who am an old woman bear a child indeed
    ?</span></li>

    <li><span>Is there any thing hard to God? according to
    appointment I will return to thee at this same time, life
    accompanying, and Sara shall have a son.</span></li>

    <li><span>Sara denied, saying: I did not laugh: for she was
    afraid. But the Lord said, Nay: but thou didst
    laugh:</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the men rose up from thence, they turned
    their eyes towards Sodom: and Abraham walked with them,
    bringing them on the way.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said: Can I hide from Abraham what I am
    about to do:</span></li>

    <li><span>"Seeing he shall become a great and mighty nation,
    and in him all the nations of the earth shall be
    blessed?</span></li>

    <li><span>For I know that he will command his children, and his
    household after him to keep the way of the Lord, and do
    judgment and justice: that for Abraham's sake the Lord may
    bring to effect all the things he hath spoken unto
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said: The cry of Sodom and Gomorrha is
    multiplied, and their sin is become exceedingly
    grievous.</span></li>

    <li><span>I will go down and see whether they have done
    according to the cry that is come to me: or whether it be not
    so, that I may know.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they turned themselves from thence, and went
    their way to Sodom: but Abraham as yet stood before the
    Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And drawing nigh he said: Wilt thou destroy the just
    with the wicked?</span></li>

    <li><span>If there be fifty just men in the city, shall they
    perish withal? and wilt thou not spare that place for the sake
    of the fifty just, if they be therein?</span></li>

    <li><span>Far be it from thee to do this thing, and to slay the
    just with the wicked, and for the just to be in like case as
    the wicked, this is not beseeming thee: thou who judgest all
    the earth, wilt not make this judgment.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to him: If I And in Sodom fifty
    just within the city, I will spare the whole place for their
    sake.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Abraham answered, and said: Seeing I have once
    begun, I will speak to my Lord, whereas I am dust and
    ashes.</span></li>

    <li><span>What if there be Ave less than fifty just persons?
    wilt thou for five and forty destroy the whole city? And he
    said: I will not destroy it, if I find five and
    forty.</span></li>

    <li><span>And again he said to him: But if forty be found
    there, what wilt thou do? He said: I will not destroy it for
    the sake of forty.</span></li>

    <li><span>Lord, saith he, be not angry, I beseech thee, if I
    speak: What if thirty shall be found there? He answered: I will
    not do it, if I And thirty there.</span></li>

    <li><span>Seeing, saith he, I have once begun, I will speak to
    my Lord. What if twenty be found there? He said: I will not
    destroy it for the sake of twenty.</span></li>

    <li><span>I beseech thee, saith he, be not angry, Lord, if I
    speak yet once more: What if tell should be found there ? And
    he said: I will not destroy it for the sake of ten.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord departed, after he had left speaking to
    Abraham: and Abraham returned to his place.</span></li>

  <h2><a name="19">Genesis 19</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And the two angels came to Sodom ii in the evening,
    and Lot was sitting in the gate of the city. And seeing them,
    he rose up and went to meet them: and worshipped prostrate to
    the ground,</span></li>

    <li><span>And said: I beseech you, my lords, turn in to the
    house of your servant, and lodge there: wash your feet, and in
    the morning you shall go on your way. And they said: No, but we
    will abide in the street.</span></li>

    <li><span>He pressed them very much to turn in unto him: and
    when they were come in to his house, he made them a feast, and
    baked unleavened bread and they ate:</span></li>

    <li><span>But before they went to bed, the men of the city
    beset the house both young and old, all the people
    together.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they called Lot, and said to him: Where are the
    men that came in to thee at night? bring them out hither that
    we may know them:</span></li>

    <li><span>Lot went out to them, and shut the door after him,
    and said:</span></li>

    <li><span>no not so, I beseech you, my brethren, do not commit
    this evil.</span></li>

    <li><span>I have two daughters who as yet have not known man :
    I will bring them out to you, and abuse you them as it shall
    please you, so that you do no evil to these men, because they
    are come in under the shadow of my roof.</span></li>

    <li><span>But they said: Get thee back thither. And again: Thou
    camest in, said they, as a, stranger, was it to be a judge?
    therefore we will afflict thee more than them. 0 And they
    pressed very violently upon Lot: and they were even at the
    point of breaking open the doors.</span></li>

    <li><span>And behold the men put out their hand, and drew in
    Lot unto them, and shut the door:</span></li>

    <li><span>And them that were without, p they struck with
    blindness from the least to the greatest, so that they could
    not find the door.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they said to Lot: Hast thou here ally of thine?
    son in law, or sons, or daughters, all that are thine bring
    them out of this city:</span></li>

    <li><span>For we will destroy this place, because their cry is
    grown loud before the Lord, who hath sent us to destroy
    them.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Lot went out, and spoke to his sons in law that
    were to have his daughters, and said : Arise : get you out of
    this place, because the Lord will destroy this city. And he
    seemed to them to speak as it were in jest.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when it was- morning, the angels pressed him,
    saying: Arise, take thy wife, and the two daughters which thou
    hast: lest thou also perish in the wickedness of the
    city.</span></li>

    <li><span>And as he lingered, they took his hand, and the hand
    of his wife, and of his two daughters, because the Lord spared
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they brought him forth, and set him without the
    city: and there they spoke to him, saying : Save thy life :
    look not back, neither stay thou in all the country about: but
    save thyself in the mountain, lest thou be also
    consumed.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Lot said to them: I beseech thee my
    Lord,</span></li>

    <li><span>Because thy servant hath found grace before thee, and
    thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewn to me, in
    saving my life, and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some
    evil seize me, and I die :</span></li>

    <li><span>There is this city here at hand, to which I may flee,
    it is a little one, and I shall be saved in it: is it not a
    little one, and my soul shall live?</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to him: Behold also in this, I have heard
    thy prayers, not to destroy the city for which thou hast
    spoken.</span></li>

    <li><span>Make haste and be saved there, because I cannot do
    any thing till thou go in thither. Therefore the name of that
    city was called Segor.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sun was risen upon the earth, and Lot entered
    into Segor.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrha brimstone
    and fire from the Lord out of heaven.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he destroyed these cities, and all the country
    about, all the inhabitants of the cities, and all things that
    spring from the earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And his wife looking behind her, was turned into a
    statue of salt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Abraham got up early in the morning and in the
    place where he had stood before with the Lord, U</span></li>

    <li><span>He looked towards Sodom and Gomorrha, and the whole
    land of that country: and he saw the ashes rise up from the
    earth as the smoke of a furnace.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now when God destroyed the cities of that country,
    remembering Abraham, he delivered Lot out of the destruction of
    the cities wherein he had dwelt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Lot went up out of Segor, and abode in the
    mountain, and his two daughters with him, (for he was afraid to
    stay in Segor,) and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two
    daughters with him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the elder said to the younger Our father is old,
    and there is no man left on the earth, to come in unto us after
    the manner of the whole earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>Come, let us make him drunk with wine, and let us lie
    with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they made their father drink wine that night: and
    the elder went in and lay with her father : but he perceived
    not neither when his daughter lay down, nor when she rose
    up.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the next day the elder said to the younger :
    Behold I lay last night with my father, let us make him drink
    wine also to night, and thou shalt lie with him, that we may
    save seed of our father.</span></li>

    <li><span>They made their father drink wine that night also,
    and the younger daughter went in, and lay with him: and neither
    then did he perceive when she lay down, nor when she rose
    up.</span></li>

    <li><span>the two daughters of Lot were with child by their
    father.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the elder bore a son, and called his name Moab:
    he is the father of the Moabites unto this day.</span></li>

    <li><span>The younger also bore a son, and called his name
    Ammon, that is, the son of my people: he is the father of the
    Ammonites unto this day.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="20">Genesis 20</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Abraham removed from thence to the south country, and
    dwelt between Cedes and Sur, and sojourned in
    Gerara.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said of Sara his wife: She is my sister. So
    Abimelech the king of Oerara sent, and took her.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and he
    said to him: Lo thou shalt die for the woman thou hast taken:
    for she hath a husband.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now Abimelech had not touched her, and he said :
    Lord, wilt thou slay a nation, that is ignorant and
    justl</span></li>

    <li><span>Did not he say to me : She is my sister: and she say,
    He is my brother? in the simplicity of my heart, and cleanness
    of my hands have I done this.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God said to him: And I know that thou didst it
    with a sincere heart: and therefore I withheld thee from
    sinning against me, and I suffered thee not to touch
    her.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now therefore restore the man his wife, for he is a
    prophet: and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: but
    if thou wilt not restore her, know that thou shalt surely die,
    thou and all that are thins.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Abimelech forthwith rising up in the night,
    called all his servants: and spoke all these words in their
    hearing, and all the men were exceedingly afraid.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Abimelech called also for Abraham, and said to
    him: What hast thou done to us? what have we offended thee in,
    that thou hast brought upon me and upon my kingdom a great sin?
    thou hast done to us what thou oughtest not to do.</span></li>

    <li><span>And again he expostulated with him, and said, What
    sawest thou, that thou hast done this?</span></li>

    <li><span>Abraham answered: I thought with myself, saying:
    Perhaps there is not the fear of God in this place: and they
    will kill me for the sake of my wife:</span></li>

    <li><span>Howbeit, otherwise also she is truly my sister, the
    daughter of my father, and not the daughter of my mother, and I
    took her to wife.</span></li>

    <li><span>And after God brought me out of my father's house, I
    said to her: I Thou shalt do me this kindness: In every place,
    to which we shall come, thou shalt say that I am thy
    brother.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and servants and
    handmaids, and gave to Abraham: and restored to him Sara, his
    wife.</span></li>

    <li><span>And said: The land is before you, dwell wheresoever
    it shall please thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>And to Sara he said: Behold I have given thy brother
    a thousand pieces of silver: this shall serve thee for a
    covering of thy eyes to all that are with thee, and
    whithersoever thou shalt go: and remember thou wast
    taken.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Abraham prayed, God healed Abimelech and his
    wife, and his handmaids, and they bore children:</span></li>

    <li><span>For the Lord had closed up every womb of the house of
    Abimelech on ac- count of Sara, Abraham's wife.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="21">Genesis 21</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And the Lord visited Sara, as he had promised: and
    fulfilled what he had spoken.</span></li>

    <li><span>And she conceived and bore a son in her old age, at
    the time that God had foretold her.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Abraham called the name of his son, whom Sara
    bore him, Isaac.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he circumcised him the eighth day, as God had
    commanded him,</span></li>

    <li><span>When he was a hundred years old: for at this age of
    his father was Isaac born.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Sara said: God hath made a laughter for me:
    whosoever shall hear of it will laugh with me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And again she said: Who would believe that Abraham
    should hear that Sara gave suck to a son, whom she bore to him
    in his old age.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the child grew and was weaned: and Abraham made a
    great feast on the day of his weaning.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Sara had seen the son of Agar the Egyptian
    playing with Isaac her son, she said to Abraham:</span></li>

    <li><span>Cast out this bondwoman, and her son: for the son of
    the bondwoman shall not be heir with my son Isaac.</span></li>

    <li><span>Abraham took this grievously for his son.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God said to him: Let it not seem grievous to thee
    for the boy, and for thy bondwoman: in all that Sara hath said
    to thee, hearken to her voice: for in Isaac shall thy seed be
    called.</span></li>

    <li><span>But I will make the son also of the bondwoman a great
    nation, because he is thy seed.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Abraham rose up in the morning, and taking bread
    and a bottle of water, put it upon her shoulder, and delivered
    the boy, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered in
    the wilderness of Bersabee.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the water in the bottle was spent, she cast
    the boy under one of the trees that were there.</span></li>

    <li><span>And she went her way, and sat over against him a
    great way off as far as a bow can carry, for she said: I will
    not see the boy die: and sitting over against, she lifted up
    her voice and wept.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God heard the voice of the boy: and an angel of
    God called to Agar from heaven, saying: What art thou doing,
    Agar? fear not: for God hath heard the voice of the boy, from
    the place wherein he is.</span></li>

    <li><span>Arise, take up the boy, and hold him by the hand: for
    I will make him a great nation.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God opened her eyes: and she saw a well of water,
    and went and filled the bottle, and gave the boy to
    drink.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God was with him: and he grew, and dwelt in the
    wilderness, and became a young man, an archer.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he dwelt in the wilderness of Pharan, and his
    mother took a wife for him out of the land of
    Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>At the same time Abimelech, and Phicol the general of
    his army said to Abraham: God is with thee in all that thou
    dost.</span></li>

    <li><span>Swear therefore by God, that thou wilt not hurt me,
    nor my posterity, nor my stock: but according to the kindness
    that I have done to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land
    wherein thou hast lived a stranger.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Abraham said: I will swear.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he reproved Abimelech for a well of water, which
    his servants had taken away by force.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Abimelech answered: I knew not who did this
    thing: and thou didst not tell me, and I heard not of it till
    today.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to
    Abimelech: and both of them made a league.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs of the
    flock.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Abimelech said to him: What mean these seven ewe
    lambs which thou hast set apart?</span></li>

    <li><span>But he said: Thou shalt take seven ewe lambs at my
    hand: that they may be a testimony for me, that I dug this
    well.</span></li>

    <li><span>Therefore that place was called Bersabee: because
    both of them did swear.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they made a league for the well of
    oath.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Abimelech, and Phicol the general of his army
    arose and returned to the land of the Palestines. But Abraham
    planted a grove in Bersabee, and there called upon the name of
    the Lord God eternal.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he was a sojourner in the land of the Palestines
    many days.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="22">Genesis 22</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>After these things, God tempted Abraham, and said to
    him: Abraham, Abraham. And he answered: Here I am.</span></li>

    <li><span>He said to him: Take thy only begotten son Isaac,
    whom thou lovest, and go into the land of vision: and there
    thou shalt offer him for a holocaust upon one of the mountains
    which I will show thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Abraham rising up in the night, saddled his ass:
    and took with him two young men, and Isaac his son: and when he
    had cut wood for the holocaust he went his way to the place
    which God had commanded him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And on the third day, lifting up his eyes, he saw the
    place afar off.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to his young men: Stay you here with the
    ass: I and the boy will go with speed as far as yonder, and
    after we have worshipped, will return to you.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he took the wood for the holocaust, and laid it
    upon Isaac his son: and he himself carried in his hands fire
    and a sword. And as they two went on together,</span></li>

    <li><span>Isaac said to his father: My father. And he answered:
    What wilt thou, son? Behold, saith he, fire and wood: where is
    the victim for the holocaust?</span></li>

    <li><span>And Abraham said: God will provide himself a victim
    for an holocaust, my son. So they went on together.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they came to the place which God had shown him,
    where he built an altar, and laid the wood in order upon it:
    and when he had bound Isaac his son, he laid him on the altar
    upon the pile of wood.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he put forth his hand and took the sword, to
    sacrifice his son.</span></li>

    <li><span>And behold an angel of the Lord from heaven called to
    him, saying: Abraham, Abraham. And he answered: Here I
    am.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to him: Lay not thy hand upon the boy,
    neither do thou any thing to him: now I know that thou fearest
    God, and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my
    sake.</span></li>

    <li><span>Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw behind his back a
    ram amongst the briers sticking fast by the horns, which he
    took and offered for a holocaust instead of his
    son.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he called the name of that place, The Lord seeth.
    Whereupon even to this day it is said: In the mountain the Lord
    will see.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second
    time from heaven, saying:</span></li>

    <li><span>By my own self have I sworn, saith the Lord: because
    thou hast done this thing, and hast not spared thy only
    begotten son for my sake:</span></li>

    <li><span>I will bless thee, and I will multiply thy seed as
    the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is by the seashore:
    thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemies.</span></li>

    <li><span>And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be
    blessed, because thou hast obeyed my voice.</span></li>

    <li><span>Abraham returned to his young men, and they went to
    Bersabee together, and he dwelt there.</span></li>

    <li><span>After these things, it was told Abraham that Melcha
    also had borne children to Nachor his brother.</span></li>

    <li><span>Hus the firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Camuel
    the father of the Syrians,</span></li>

    <li><span>And Cased, and Azau, and Pheldas, and
    Jedlaph,</span></li>

    <li><span>And Bathuel, of whom was born Rebecca: These eight
    did Melcha bear to Nachor Abraham's brother.</span></li>

    <li><span>And his concubine, named Roma, bore Tabee, and Gaham,
    and Tahas, and Maacha.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="23">Genesis 23</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And Sara lived a hundred and twenty-seven
    years.</span></li>

    <li><span>And she died in the city of Arbee which is Hebron, in
    the land of Chanaan: and Abraham came to mourn and weep for
    her.</span></li>

    <li><span>And after he rose up from the funeral obsequies, he
    spoke to the children of Heth, saying:</span></li>

    <li><span>I am a stranger and sojourner among you: give me the
    right of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my
    dead.</span></li>

    <li><span>The children of Heth answered, saying:</span></li>

    <li><span>My Lord, hear us, thou art a prince of God among us:
    bury thy dead in our principle sepulchers: and no man shall
    have power to hinder thee from burying thy dead in his
    sepulcher.</span></li>

    <li><span>Abraham rose up, and bowed down to the people of the
    land, to wit the children of Heth:</span></li>

    <li><span>And said to them: If it please your soul that I
    should bury my dead, hear me, and intercede for me to Ephron
    the son of Seor.</span></li>

    <li><span>That he may give me the double cave, which he hath in
    the end of his field: for as much money as it is worth he shall
    give it me before you, for a possession of a
    buryingplace.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now Ephron dwelt in the midst of the children of
    Heth. And Ephron made answer to Abraham in the hearing of all
    that went in at the gate of the city, saying:</span></li>

    <li><span>Let it not be so, my lord, but do thou rather hearken
    to what I say: The field I deliver to thee, and the cave that
    is therein, in the presence of the children of my people, bury
    thy dead.</span></li>

    <li><span>Abraham bowed down before the people of the
    land,</span></li>

    <li><span>And he spoke to Ephron, in the presence of the
    people: I beseech thee to hear me: I will give money for the
    field: take it, and so I will bury my dead in it.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Ephron answered:</span></li>

    <li><span>My lord, hear me. The ground which thou desirest, is
    worth four hundred sicles of silver: this is the price between
    me and thee: but what is this? bury thy dead.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Abraham had heard this, he weighed out the
    money that Ephron had asked, in the hearing of the children of
    Heth, four hundred sicles of silver of common current
    money.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the field that before was Ephron's, wherein was
    the double cave, looking towards Mambre, both it and the cave,
    and all the trees thereof in all its limits round
    about,</span></li>

    <li><span>Was made sure to Abraham for a possession, in the
    sight of the children of Heth, and of all that went in at the
    gate of his city.</span></li>

    <li><span>And so Abraham buried Sara his wife, in a double cave
    of the field, that looked towards Mambre, this is Hebron in the
    land of Chanaan.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the field was made sure to Abraham, and the cave
    that was in it, for a possession to bury in, by the children of
    Heth.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="24">Genesis 24</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Now Abraham was old; and advanced in age: and the
    Lord had blessed him in all things.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to the elder servant of his house, who
    was ruler over all he had: Put thy hand under my
    thigh,</span></li>

    <li><span>That I may make thee swear by the Lord the God of
    heaven and earth, that thou take not a wife for my son, of the
    daughters of the Chanaanites, among whom I dwell:</span></li>

    <li><span>But that thou go to my own country and kindred, and
    take a wife from thence for my son Isaac.</span></li>

    <li><span>The servant answered: If the woman will not come with
    me into this land, must I bring thy son back again to the
    place, from whence thou camest out?</span></li>

    <li><span>And Abraham said: Beware thou never bring my son back
    again thither.</span></li>

    <li><span>The Lord God of heaven, who took me out of my
    father's house, and out of my native country, who spoke to me,
    and swore to me, saying: To thy seed will I give this land: he
    will send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take from
    thence a wife for my son.</span></li>

    <li><span>But if the woman will not follow thee, thou shalt not
    be bound by the oath; only bring not my son back thither
    again.</span></li>

    <li><span>The servant therefore put his hand under the thigh of
    Abraham his lord, and swore to him upon this word.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he took ten camels of his master's herd, and
    departed, carrying something of all his goods with him, and he
    set forth and went on to Mesopotamia to the city of
    Nachor.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had made the camels lie down without the
    town near a well of water in Evening, at the time when women
    were wont to come out to draw water, he said:</span></li>

    <li><span>O Lord the God of my master Abraham, meet me today, I
    beseech thee, and show kindness to my master
    Abraham.</span></li>

    <li><span>Behold I stand nigh the spring of water, and the
    daughters of the inhabitants of this city will come out to draw
    water.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now, therefore, the maid to whom I shall say: Let
    down thy pitcher that I may drink: and she shall answer, Drink,
    and I will give thy camels drink also: let it be the same whom
    thou hast provided for thy servant Isaac: and by this I shall
    understand, that thou hast shown kindness to my
    master.</span></li>

    <li><span>he had not yet ended these words within himself, and
    behold Rebecca came out, the daughter of Bathuel, son of
    Melcha, wife to Nachor the brother of Abraham, having a pitcher
    on her shoulder:</span></li>

    <li><span>An exceedingly comely maid, and a most beautiful
    virgin, and not known to man: and she went down to the spring,
    and filled her pitcher and was coming back.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the servant ran to meet her, and said: Give me a
    little water to drink of thy pitcher.</span></li>

    <li><span>And she answered: Drink, my lord. And quickly she let
    down the pitcher upon her arm, and gave him drink.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had drunk, she said: I will draw water
    for thy camels also, till they all drink.</span></li>

    <li><span>And pouring out the pitcher into the troughs, she ran
    back to the well to draw water: and having drawn she gave to
    all the camels.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he musing beheld her with silence, desirous to
    know whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or
    not.</span></li>

    <li><span>And after that the camels had drunk, the man took out
    golden earrings, weighing two sicles: and as many bracelets of
    ten sicles weight.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to her: Whose daughter art thou? tell me:
    is there any place in thy father's house to lodge?</span></li>

    <li><span>And she answered: I am the daughter of Bathuel, the
    son of Melcha, whom she bore to Nachor.</span></li>

    <li><span>And she said moreover to him: We have good store of
    both straw and hay, and a large place to lodge in.</span></li>

    <li><span>The man bowed himself down, and adored the
    Lord,</span></li>

    <li><span>Saying: Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham,
    who hath not taken away his mercy and truth from my master, and
    hath brought me the straight way into the house of my master's
    brother.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then the maid ran, and told in her mother's house,
    all that she had heard.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Rebecca had a brother named Laban, who went out
    in haste to the man, to the well.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had seen the earrings and bracelets in
    his sister's hands, and had heard all that she related, saying:
    Thus and thus the man spoke to me: he came to the man who stood
    by the camels, and near to the spring of water,</span></li>

    <li><span>And said to him: Come in, thou blessed of the Lord:
    why standest thou without? I have prepared the house, and a
    place for the camels.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he brought him in into his lodging: and he
    unharnessed the camels and gave straw and hay, and water to
    wash his feet, and the feet of the men that were come with
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And bread was set before him. But he said: I will not
    eat, till I tell my message. He answered him:
    Speak.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said: I am the servant of Abraham:</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord hath blessed my master wonderfully, and
    he is become great: and he hath given him sheep and oxen,
    silver and gold, menservants and womenservants, camels and
    asses.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Sara my master's wife hath borne my master a son
    in her old age, and he hath given him all that he
    had.</span></li>

    <li><span>And my master made me swear, saying: Thou shalt not
    take a wife for my son of the Chanaanites, in whose land I
    dwell:</span></li>

    <li><span>But thou shalt go to my father's house, and shalt
    take a wife of my own kindred for my son:</span></li>

    <li><span>But I answered my master: What if the woman will not
    come with me?</span></li>

    <li><span>The Lord, said he, in whose sight I walk, will send
    his angel with thee, and will direct thy way: and thou shalt
    take a wife for my son of my own kindred, and of my father's
    house.</span></li>

    <li><span>But thou shalt be clear from my curse, when thou
    shalt come to my kindred, if they will not give thee
    one.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I came today to the well of water, and said: O
    Lord God of my master Abraham, if thou hast prospered my way,
    wherein I now walk,</span></li>

    <li><span>Behold I stand by the well of water, and the virgin,
    that shall come out to draw water, who shall hear me say: Give
    me a little water to drink of thy pitcher:</span></li>

    <li><span>And shall say to me: Both drink thou, and I will also
    draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman, whom the Lord
    hath prepared for my master's son.</span></li>

    <li><span>And whilst I pondered these things secretly with
    myself, Rebecca appeared coming with a pitcher, which she
    carried on her shoulder: and she went down to the well and drew
    water. And I said to her: Give me a little to
    drink.</span></li>

    <li><span>And she speedily let down the pitcher from her
    shoulder, and said to me: Both drink thou, and to thy camels I
    will give drink. I drank, and she watered the
    camels.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I asked her, and said: Whose daughter art thou?
    And she answered: I am the daughter of Bathuel, the son of
    Nachor, whom Melcha bore to him. So I put earrings on her to
    adorn her face, and I put bracelets on her hands.</span></li>

    <li><span>And falling down I adored the Lord, blessing the Lord
    God of my master Abraham, who hath brought me the straight way
    to take the daughter of my master's brother for his
    son.</span></li>

    <li><span>Wherefore if you do according to mercy and truth with
    my master, tell me: but if it please you otherwise, tell me
    that also, that I may go to the right hand, or to the
    left.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Laban and Bathuel answered: The word hath
    proceeded from the Lord, we cannot speak any other thing to
    thee but his pleasure.</span></li>

    <li><span>Behold Rebecca is before thee, take her and go thy
    way, and let her be the wife of thy master's son, as the Lord
    hath spoken.</span></li>

    <li><span>WHich when Abraham's servant heard, falling down to
    the ground he adored the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And bringing forth vessels of silver and gold, and
    garments, he gave them to Rebecca for a present. He offered
    gifts also to her brothers, and to her mother.</span></li>

    <li><span>And a banquet was made, and they ate and drank
    together, and lodged there. And in the morning, the servant
    arose, and said: Let me depart, that I may go to my
    master.</span></li>

    <li><span>And her brother and mother answered: Let the maid
    stay at least ten days with us, and afterwards she shall
    depart.</span></li>

    <li><span>Stay me not, said he, because the Lord hath prospered
    my way: send me away, that I may go to my master.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they said: Let us call the maid, and ask her
    will.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they called her, and when she was come, they
    asked: Wilt thou go with this man? She said: I will
    go.</span></li>

    <li><span>So they sent her away, and her nurse, and Abraham's
    servant, and his company,</span></li>

    <li><span>Wishing prosperity to their sister, and saying: Thou
    art our sister, mayst thou increase to thousands of thousands,
    and may thy seed possess the gates of their
    enemies.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Rebecca and her maids, being set upon camels,
    followed the man: who with speed returned to his
    master.</span></li>

    <li><span>At the same time Isaac was walking along the way to
    the well which is called Of the living and the seeing: for he
    dwelt in the south country.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he was gone forth to meditate in the field, the
    day being now well spent: and when he had lifted up his eyes,
    he saw camels coming afar off.</span></li>

    <li><span>Rebecca also, when she saw Isaac, lighted off the
    camel,</span></li>

    <li><span>And said to the servant: Who is that man who cometh
    towards us along the field? And he said to her: That man is my
    master. But she quickly took her cloak, and covered
    herself.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the servant told Isaac all that he had
    done.</span></li>

    <li><span>Who brought her into the tent of Sara his mother, and
    took her to wife: and he loved her so much, that it moderated
    the sorrow which was occasioned by his mother's
    death.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="25">Genesis 25</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And Abraham married another wife, named
    Cetura:</span></li>

    <li><span>Who bore to him Zamran, and Jecsan, and Madan, and
    Madian, and Jesboc, and Sue.</span></li>

    <li><span>Jecsan also begot Saba and Dadan. The children of
    Dadan were Assurim, and Latusim, and Loomin.</span></li>

    <li><span>But of Madian was born Epha, and Opher, and Henoch,
    and Abida, and Eldaa: all these were the children of
    Cetura.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Abraham gave all his possessions to
    Isaac.</span></li>

    <li><span>And to the children of the concubines he gave gifts,
    and separated them from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, to
    the east country.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the days of Abraham's life were a hundred and
    seventy-five years.</span></li>

    <li><span>And decaying he died in a good old age, and having
    lived a long time, and being full of days: and was gathered to
    his people.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Isaac and Ismael his sons buried him in the
    double cave, which was situated in the field of Ephron the son
    of Seor the Hethite, over against Mambre;</span></li>

    <li><span>Which he had bought of the children of Heth: there
    was he buried, and Sara his wife.</span></li>

    <li><span>And after his death, God blessed Isaac his son, who
    dwelt by the well named Of the living and seeing.</span></li>

    <li><span>These are the generations of Ismael the son of
    Abraham, whom Agar the Egyptian, Sara's servant, bore unto
    him:</span></li>

    <li><span>And these are the names of his children according to
    their calling and generations. The firstborn of Ismael was
    Nabajoth, then Cedar, and Adbeel, and Mabsam.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Masma, and Duma, and Massa,</span></li>

    <li><span>Hadar, and Thema, and Jethur, and Naphis, and
    Cedma.</span></li>

    <li><span>These are the sons of Ismael: and these are their
    names by their castles and towns, twelve princes of their
    tribes.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the years of Ismael's life were a hundred and
    thirty-seven, and decaying he died, and was gathered unto his
    people.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he dwelt from Hevila as far as Sur, which looketh
    towards Egypt, to them that go towards the Assyrians. He died
    in the presence of all his brethren.</span></li>

    <li><span>These also are the generations of Isaac the son of
    Abraham: Abraham begot Isaac:</span></li>

    <li><span>Who when he was forty years old, took to wife Rebecca
    the daughter of Bathuel the Syrian of Mesopotamia, sister to
    Laban.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Isaac besought the Lord for his wife, because she
    was barren; and he heard him, and made Rebecca to
    conceive.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the children struggled in her womb: and she said:
    If it were to be so with me, what need was there to conceive?
    And she went to consult the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he answering said: Two nations are in thy womb,
    and two peoples shall be divided out of thy womb, and one
    people shall overcome the other, and the elder shall serve the
    younger.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when her time was come to be delivered, behold
    twins were found in her womb.</span></li>

    <li><span>He that came forth first was red, and hairy like a
    skin: and his name was called Esau. Immediately the other
    coming forth, held his brother's foot in his hand, and
    therefore he was called Jacob.</span></li>

    <li><span>Isaac was threescore years old when the children were
    born unto him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they were grown up, Esau became a skillful
    hunter, and a husbandman, but Jacob a plain man dwelt in
    tents.</span></li>

    <li><span>Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of his hunting: and
    Rebecca loved Jacob.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jacob boiled Pottage: to whom Esau, coming faint
    out of the field,</span></li>

    <li><span>Said: Give me of this red pottage, for I am exceeding
    faint. For which reason his name was called Edom.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jacob said to him: Sell me thy first
    birthright.</span></li>

    <li><span>He answered: Lo I die, what will the first birthright
    avail me.</span></li>

    <li><span>Jacob said: Swear therefore to me. Esau swore to him,
    and sold his first birthright.</span></li>

    <li><span>And so taking bread and the pottage of lentils, he
    ate, and drank, and went his way; making little account of
    having sold his first birthright.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="26">Genesis 26</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And when a famine came in the land, after that
    barrenness which had happened in the days of Abraham, Isaac
    went to Abimelech king of the Palestines to Gerara.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord appeared to him and said: Go not down
    into Egypt, but stay in the land that I shall tell
    thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>And sojourn in it, and I will be with thee, and will
    bless thee: for to thee and to thy seed I will give all these
    countries, to fulfill the oath which I swore to Abraham thy
    father.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I will multiply thy seed like the stars of
    heaven: and I will give to thy posterity all these countries:
    and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be
    blessed.</span></li>

    <li><span>Because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my precepts
    and commandments, and observed my ceremonies and
    laws.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Isaac abode in Gerara.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he was asked by the men of that place,
    concerning his wife, he answered: She is my sister; for he was
    afraid to confess that she was his wife, thinking lest perhaps
    they would like him because of her beauty.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when very many days were passed, and he abode
    there, Abimelech king of the Palestines looking out through a
    window, saw him playing with Rebecca his wife.</span></li>

    <li><span>And calling for him, he said: It is evident she is
    thy wife: why didst thou feign her to be thy sister? He
    answered: I feared lest I should die for her sake.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Abimelech said: Why hadst thou deceived us? Some
    man of the people might have lain with thy wife, and thou hadst
    brought upon us a great sin. And he commanded all the people,
    saying:</span></li>

    <li><span>He that shall touch this man's wife, shall surely be
    put to death.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Isaac sowed in that land, and he found that same
    year a hundredfold: and the Lord blessed him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the man was enriched, and he went on prospering
    and increasing, till he became exceeding great:</span></li>

    <li><span>And he had possessions of sheep and of herds, and a
    very great family. Wherefore the Palestines envying
    him,</span></li>

    <li><span>Stopped up at that time all the wells, that the
    servants of his father Abraham had digged, filling them up with
    earth:</span></li>

    <li><span>Insomuch that Abimelech himself said to Isaac: Depart
    from us, for thou art become much mightier than we.</span></li>

    <li><span>So he departed and came to the torrent of Gerara, to
    dwell there:</span></li>

    <li><span>And he digged again other wells, which the servants
    of his father Abraham had digged, and which, after his death,
    the Palestines had of old stopped up: and he called them by the
    same names by which his father before had called
    them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they digged in the torrent, and found living
    water.</span></li>

    <li><span>But there also the herdsmen of Gerara strove against
    the herdsmen of Isaac, saying: It is our water. Wherefore he
    called the name of the well, on occasion of that which had
    happened, Calumny.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they digged also another; and for that they
    quarreled likewise, and he called the name of it,
    Enmity.</span></li>

    <li><span>Going forward from thence, he digged another well,
    for which they contended not: therefore he called the name
    thereof, Latitude, saying: Now hath the Lord given us room, and
    made us to increase upon the earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he went up from that place to
    Bersabee,</span></li>

    <li><span>Where the Lord appeared to him that same might,
    saying: I am the God of Abraham thy father; do not fear, for I
    am with thee: I will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my
    servant Abraham's sake.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he built there an altar: and called upon the name
    of the Lord, and pitched his tent: and commanded his servants
    to dig a well.</span></li>

    <li><span>To which place when Abimelech, and Ochozath his
    friend, and Phicol chief captain of his soldiers came from
    Gerara,</span></li>

    <li><span>Isaac said to them: Why are ye come to me, a man whom
    you hate, and have thrust out from you?</span></li>

    <li><span>And they answered: We saw that the Lord is with thee,
    and therefore we said: Let there be an oath between us, and let
    us make a covenant,</span></li>

    <li><span>That thou do us no harm, as we on our part have
    touched nothing of thine, nor have done any thing to hurt thee:
    but with peace have sent thee away increased with the blessing
    of the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he made them a feast, and after they had eaten
    and drunk:</span></li>

    <li><span>Arising in the morning, they swore one to another:
    and Isaac sent them away peaceably to their own
    home.</span></li>

    <li><span>And behold the same day the servants of Isaac came,
    telling him of a well which they had digged, and saying: We
    have found water.</span></li>

    <li><span>Whereupon he called it Abundance: and the name of the
    city was called Bersabee, even to this day.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Esau being forty years old, married wives, Judith
    the daughter of Beeri the Hethite, and Basemath the daughter of
    Elon of the same place.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they both offended the mind of Isaac and
    Rebecca.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="27">Genesis 27</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Now Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, and he
    could not see: and he called Esau, his elder son, and said to
    him: My son? And he answered: Here I am.</span></li>

    <li><span>And his father said to him: Thou seest that I am old,
    and know not the day of my death.</span></li>

    <li><span>Take thy arms, thy quiver, and bow, and go abroad:
    and when thou hast taken some thing by hunting,</span></li>

    <li><span>Make me savoury meat thereof, as thou knowest I like,
    and bring it, that I may eat: and my soul may bless thee before
    I die.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Rebecca had heard this, and he was gone into
    the field to fulfill his father's commandment,</span></li>

    <li><span>She said to her son Jacob: I heard thy father talking
    with Esau thy brother, and saying to him:</span></li>

    <li><span>Bring me of thy hunting, and make me meats that I may
    eat, and bless thee in the sight of the Lord, before I
    die.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now, therefore, my son, follow my
    counsel:</span></li>

    <li><span>And go thy way to the flock, bring me two kids of the
    best, that I may make of them meat for thy father, such as he
    gladly eateth:</span></li>

    <li><span>Which when thou hast brought in, and he hath eaten,
    he may bless thee before he die.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he answered her: Thou knowest that Esau my
    brother is a hairy man, and I am smooth.</span></li>

    <li><span>If my father shall feel me, and perceive it, I fear
    lest he will think I would have mocked him, and I shall bring
    upon me a curse instead of a blessing.</span></li>

    <li><span>And his mother said to him: Upon me be this curse, my
    son: only hear thou my voice, and go, fetch me the things which
    I have said.</span></li>

    <li><span>He went, and brought, and gave them to his mother.
    She dressed meats, such as she knew his father
    liked.</span></li>

    <li><span>And she put on him very good garments of Esau, which
    she had at home with her:</span></li>

    <li><span>And the little skins of the kids she put about his
    hands, and covered the bare of his neck.</span></li>

    <li><span>And she gave him the savoury meat, and delivered him
    bread that she had baked.</span></li>

    <li><span>Which when he had carried in, he said: My father? But
    he answered: I hear. Who art thou, my son?</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jacob said: I am Esau thy firstborn: I have done
    as thou didst command me: arise, sit, and eat of my venison,
    that thy soul may bless me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Isaac said to his son: How couldst thou find it
    so quickly, my son?</span></li>

    <li><span>And Isaac said: Come hither, that I may feel thee, my
    son, and may prove whether thou be my son Esau, or
    not.</span></li>

    <li><span>He came near to his father, and when he had felt him,
    Isaac said: The voice indeed is the voice of Jacob; but the
    hands are the hands of Esau.</span></li>

    <li><span>He said: Art thou my son Esau? He answered: I
    am.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then he said: Bring me the meats of thy hunting, my
    son, that my soul may bless thee. And when they were brought,
    and he had eaten, he offered him wine also, which after he had
    drunk,</span></li>

    <li><span>He said to him: Come near me, and give me a kiss, my
    son.</span></li>

    <li><span>He came near, and kissed him. And immediately as he
    smelled the fragrant smell of his garments, blessing him, he
    said: Behold the smell of my son is as the smell of a plentiful
    field, which Lord hath blessed.</span></li>

    <li><span>God give thee the dew of heaven, and of the fatness
    of the earth, abundance of corn and wine.</span></li>

    <li><span>And let peoples serve thee, and tribes worship thee:
    be thou lord of thy brethren, and let they mother's children
    bow down before thee. Cursed be he that curseth thee: and let
    him that blesseth thee be filled with blessings.</span></li>

    <li><span>Isaac had scarce ended his words, when Jacob being
    now gone out abroad, Esau came,</span></li>

    <li><span>And brought in to his father meats made of what he
    had taken in hunting, saying: Arise, my father, and eat of thy
    son's venison; that thy soul may bless me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Isaac said to him: Why! who art thou? He
    answered: I am thy firstborn son Esau.</span></li>

    <li><span>Isaac was struck with fear, and astonished
    exceedingly: and wondering beyond what can be believed, said
    Who is he then the even now brought me venison that he had
    taken, and I ate of all before thou camest? and I have blessed
    him, and he shall be blessed.</span></li>

    <li><span>Esau having heard his father's words, roared out with
    a great cry: and being in a great consternation, said: Bless me
    also, my father.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said: Thy brother came deceitfully and got thy
    blessing.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he said again: Rightly is his name called Jacob;
    for he hath supplanted me lo this second time: my first
    birthright he took away before, and now this second time he
    hath stolen away my blessing. And again he said to his father:
    Hast thou not reserved me also a blessing?</span></li>

    <li><span>Isaac answered: I have appointed him thy lord, and
    have made all his brethren his servants: I have established him
    with corn and wine, and after this, what shall I do more for
    thee, my son?</span></li>

    <li><span>And Esac said to him: Hast thou only one blessing,
    father? I beseech thee bless me also. And when he wept with a
    loud cry,</span></li>

    <li><span>Isaac being moved, said to him: In the fat of the
    earth, and in the dew of heaven from above,</span></li>

    <li><span>Shall thy blessing be. Thou shalt live by the sword
    and shalt serve thy brother: and the time shall come, when thou
    shalt shake off and loose his yoke from thy neck.</span></li>

    <li><span>Esau therefore always hated Jacob for the blessing
    wherewith his father had blessed him: and he said in his heart:
    The days will come of the mourning of my father, and I will
    kill my brother Jacob.</span></li>

    <li><span>These things were told to Rebecca: and she sent and
    called Jacob her son, and said to him: Behold Esau thy brother
    threateneth to kill thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now therefore, my son, hear my voice: arise and flee
    to Laban my brother to Haran:</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt dwell with him a few days, till wrath
    of thy brother be assuaged,</span></li>

    <li><span>And his indignation cease, and he forget the things
    thou hast done to him: afterwards I will send, and bring thee
    from thence hither. Why shall I be deprived of both my sons in
    one day?</span></li>

    <li><span>And Rebecca said to Isaac: I am weary of my life
    because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the
    stock of this land, I choose not to live.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="28">Genesis 28</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged
    him, saying: Take not a wife of the stock of
    Chanaan:</span></li>

    <li><span>But go, and take a journey to Mesopotamia of Syria,
    to the house of Bathuel thy mother's father, and take thee a
    wife thence of the daughters of Laban thy uncle.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God almighty bless thee, and make thee to
    increase, and multiply thee: that thou mayst be a multitude of
    people.</span></li>

    <li><span>And give the blessings of Abrabam to thee, and to thy
    seed after thee: that thou mayst possess the land of thy
    sojournment, which he promised to thy grandfather.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Isaac had sent him away, he took his journey
    and went to Mesopotamia of Syria to Laban the son of Bathuel
    the Syrian, brother to Rebecca his mother.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Esau seeing that his father had blessed Jacob,
    and had sent him into Mesopotamia of Syria, to marry a wife
    thence; and that after the blessing he had charged him, saying:
    Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of
    Chanaan:</span></li>

    <li><span>And that Jacob obeying his parents was gone into
    Syria:</span></li>

    <li><span>Experiencing also that his father was not well
    pleased with the daughters of Chanaan:</span></li>

    <li><span>He went to Ismael, and took to wife, besides them he
    had before, Maheleth the daughter of Ismael, Abraham's son, the
    sister of Nabajoth.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Jacob being departed from Bersabee, went on to
    Haran.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he was come to a certain place, and would
    rest in it after sunset, he took of the stones that lay there,
    and putting under his head, slept in the same
    place.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he saw in his sleep a ladder standing upon the
    earth, and the top thereof touching heaven: the angels also of
    God ascending and descending by it;</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord leaning upon the ladder, saying to him:
    I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac;
    the land, wherein thou sleepest, I will give to thee and to thy
    seed.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth: thou
    shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the
    north, and to the south: and IN THEE and thy seed all the
    tribes of the earth SHALL BE BLESSED.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I will be thy keeper whithersoever thou goest,
    and will bring thee back into this land: neither will I leave
    thee, till I shall have accomplished all that I have
    said.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Jacob awaked out of sleep, he said: Indeed
    the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not.</span></li>

    <li><span>And trembling he said: How terrible is this place!
    this is no other but the house of God, and the gate of
    heaven.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jacob, arising in the morning, took the stone,
    which he had laid under his head, and set it up for a title,
    pouring oil upon the top of it.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he called the name of the city Bethel, which
    before was called Luza.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he made a vow, saying: If God shall be with me,
    and shall keep me in the way by which I walk, and shall give me
    bread to eat, and raiment to put on,</span></li>

    <li><span>And I shall return prosperously to my father's house:
    the Lord shall be my God:</span></li>

    <li><span>And this stone, which I have set up for a title,
    shall called the house of God: and of all things that thou
    shalt give to me, I will offer tithes to thee.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="29">Genesis 29</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Then Jacob went on in his journey, and came into the
    east country.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he saw a well in the field, and three flocks of
    sheep lying by it: for the beasts were watered out of it, and
    the mouth thereof was closed with a great stone.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the custom was, when all the sheep were gathered
    together to roll away the stone, and after the sheep were
    watered, to put it on the mouth of the well again.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to the shepherds: Brethren, whence are
    you? They answered: Of Haran.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he asked them, saying: Know you Laban the son of
    Nachor? They said: We know him.</span></li>

    <li><span>He said: Is he in health? He is in health, say they:
    and behold Rachel his daughter cometh with his
    flock.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jacob said: There is yet much day remaining,
    neither is it time to bring the flocks into the folds again:
    first give the sheep drink, and so lead them back to
    feed.</span></li>

    <li><span>They answered: We cannot, till all the cattle be
    gathered together, and we remove the stone from the well's
    mouth, that we may water the flocks.</span></li>

    <li><span>They were yet speaking, and behold Rachel came with
    her father's sheep: for she fed the flock.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Jacob saw her, and knew her to be his
    cousin-german, and that they were the sheep of Laban, his
    uncle: he removed the stone wherewith the well was
    closed.</span></li>

    <li><span>And having watered the flock, he kissed her: and
    lifting up his voice, wept.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he told her that he was her father's brother, and
    the son of Rebecca: but she went in haste and told her
    father.</span></li>

    <li><span>Who, when he heard that Jacob his sister's son was
    come, ran forth to meet him; and embracing him, and heartily
    kissing him, brought him into his house. And when he had heard
    the causes of his journey,</span></li>

    <li><span>He answered: Thou art my bone and my flesh. And after
    the days of one month were expired,</span></li>

    <li><span>He said to him: Because thou art my brother, shalt
    thou serve me without wages? Tell me what wages thou wilt
    have.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now he had two daughters, the name of the elder was
    Lia: and the younger was called Richel.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Lia was blear eyed: Rachel was well favoured, and
    of a beautiful countenance.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jacob being in love with her, said: I will serve
    thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.</span></li>

    <li><span>Lahan answered: It is better that I give her thee
    than to another man; stay with me.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Jacob served seven years for Rachel: and they
    seemed but a few days, because of the greatness of his
    love.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to Laban: Give me my wife; for now the
    time is fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he, having invited a great number of his friends
    to the feast, made the marriage.</span></li>

    <li><span>And at night he brought in Lia his daughter to
    him,</span></li>

    <li><span>Giving his daughter a handmaid, named Zalpha. Now
    when Jacob had gone in to her according to custom when morning
    was come he saw it was Lia:</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to his father in law: What is it that
    thou didst mean to do? did not I serve thee for Rachel? why
    hast thou deceived me?</span></li>

    <li><span>Laban answered: It is not the custom in this place,
    to give the younger in marriage first.</span></li>

    <li><span>Make up the week of days of this match: and I will
    give thee her also, for the service that thou shalt render me
    other seven years.</span></li>

    <li><span>He yielded to his pleasure: and after the week was
    past, he married Rachel:</span></li>

    <li><span>To whom her father gave Bala for her
    servant.</span></li>

    <li><span>And having at length obtained the marriage he wished
    for, he preferred the love of the latter before the former, and
    served with him other seven years.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord seeing that he despised Lia, opened her
    womb, but her sister remained barren.</span></li>

    <li><span>And she conceived and bore a son, and called his name
    Ruben, saying: The Lord saw my affliction: now my husband will
    love me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And again she conceived and bore a son, and said:
    Because the Lord heard that I was despised, he hath given this
    also to me: and she called his name Simeon.</span></li>

    <li><span>And she conceived the third time, and bore another
    son: and said: Now also my husband will be joined to me,
    because I have borne him three sons: and therefore she called
    hi sname Levi.</span></li>

    <li><span>The fourth time she conceived and bore a son, and
    said: now will I praise the Lord: and for this she called him
    Juda. And she left bearing.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="30">Genesis 30</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And Rachel, seeing herself without children, envied
    her sister, and said to her husband: Give me children,
    otherwise I shall die.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jacob being angry with her, answered: Am I as
    God, who hath deprived thee of the fruit of thy
    womb?</span></li>

    <li><span>But she said: I have here my servant Bala: go in unto
    her, that she may bear upon my knees, and I may have children
    by her.</span></li>

    <li><span>And she gave him Bala in marriage: who,</span></li>

    <li><span>When her husband had gone in unto her, conceived and
    bore a son.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Rachel said: The Lord hath judged for me, and
    hath heard my voice, giving me a son, and therefore she called
    his name Dan.</span></li>

    <li><span>And again Bala conceived and bore
    another,</span></li>

    <li><span>For whom Rachel said: God hath compared me with my
    sister, and I have prevailed: and she called him
    Nephtali.</span></li>

    <li><span>Lia, perceiving that she had left off bearing, gave
    Zelpha her handmaid to her husband.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when she had conceived and brought forth a
    son,</span></li>

    <li><span>She said: Happily. And therefore called his name
    Gad.</span></li>

    <li><span>Zelpha also bore another.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Lia said: This is for my happiness: for women
    will call me blessed. Therefore she called him
    Aser.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Ruben, going out in the time of the wheat harvest
    into the field, found mandrakes: which he brought to his mother
    Lia. And Rachel said: Give me part of thy son's
    mandrakes.</span></li>

    <li><span>She answered: Dost thou think it a small matter, that
    thou hast taken my husband from me, unless thou take also my
    son's mandrakes? Rachel said: He shall sleep with thee this
    night, for thy son's mandrakes.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Jacob returned at even from the field, Lia
    went out to meet him, and said: Thou shalt come in unto me,
    because I have hired thee for my son's mandrakes. And he slept
    with her that night.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God heard her prayers: and she conceived and bore
    the fifth son,</span></li>

    <li><span>And said: God hath given me a reward, because I gave
    my handmaid to my husband. And she called his name
    Issachar.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Lia conceived again, and bore the sixth
    son,</span></li>

    <li><span>And said: God hath endowed me with a good dowry: this
    turn also my husband will be with me, because I have borne him
    six sons: and therefore she called his name
    Zabulon.</span></li>

    <li><span>After whom she bore a daughter, named
    Diana.</span></li>

    <li><span>The Lord also remembering Rachel, heard her, and
    opened her womb.</span></li>

    <li><span>And she conceived, and bore a son, saying: God hath
    taken my reproach.</span></li>

    <li><span>And she called his name Joseph, saying: The Lord give
    me also another son.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Joseph was born, Jacob said to his father in
    law: Send me away that I may return into my country, and to my
    land.</span></li>

    <li><span>Give me my wives, and my children, for whom I have
    served thee, that I may depart: thou knowest the service that I
    have rendered thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>Laban said to him: Let me find favour in thy sight: I
    have learned by experience, that God hath blessed me for thy
    sake.</span></li>

    <li><span>Appoint thy wages which I shall give
    thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he answered: Thou knowest how I have served thee,
    and how great thy possession hath been in my hands.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou hadst but little before I came to thee, and now
    thou art become rich: and the Lord hath blessed thee at my
    coming. It is reasonable therefore that I should now provide
    also for my own house.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Laban said: What shall I give thee? But he said:
    I require nothing: but if thou wilt do what I demand, I will
    feed, and keep thy sheep again.</span></li>

    <li><span>Go round through all thy flocks, and separate all the
    sheep of divers colours, and speckled: and all that is brown
    and spotted, and of divers colours, as well among the sheep, as
    among the goats, shall be my wages.</span></li>

    <li><span>And my justice shall answer for me to morrow before
    thee when the time of the bargain shall come: and all that is
    not of divers colours, and spotted, and brown, as well among
    the sheep as among the goats, shall accuse me of
    theft.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Laban said: I like well what thou
    demandest.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he separated the name day the she goats, and the
    sheep, and the he goats, and the rams of divers colours, and
    spotted: and all the flock of one colour, that is, of white and
    black fleece, he delivered into the hands of his
    sons.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he set the space of three days' journey betwixt
    himself and his son in law, who fed the rest of his
    flock.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jacob took green robs of poplar, and of almond,
    and of place trees, and pilled them in part: so when the bark
    was taken off, in the parts that were pilled, there appeared
    whiteness: but the parts that were whole remained green: and by
    this means the colour was divers.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he put them in the troughs, where the water was
    poured out: that when the flocks should come to drink, they
    might have the rods before their eyes, and in the sight of them
    might conceive.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it came to pass that in the very heat of coition,
    the sheep beheld the rods, and brought forth spotted, and of
    divers colours, and speckled.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jacob separated the flock, and put the rods in
    the troughs before the eyes of the rams: and all the white and
    the black were Laban's: and the rest were Jacob's, when the
    flocks were separated one from the other.</span></li>

    <li><span>So when the ewes went first to ram, Jacob put the
    rods in the roughs of water before the eyes of the rams, and of
    the ewes, that they might conceive while they were looking upon
    them:</span></li>

    <li><span>But when the latter coming was, and the last
    conceiving, he did not put them. And those that were late ward,
    become Laban's: and they of the first time,
    Jacob's.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the man was enriched exceedingly, and he had many
    flocks, maid servants and men servants, camels and
    asses.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="31">Genesis 31</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>But after that he heard the words of the sons of
    Laban, saying: Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's,
    and being enriched by his substance is become
    great:</span></li>

    <li><span>And perceiving also that Laban's countenance was not
    towards him as yesterday and the other day,</span></li>

    <li><span>Especially the Lord saying to him: Return into the
    land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred, and I will be with
    thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>He sent, and called Rachel and Lia into the field,
    where he fed the flocks,</span></li>

    <li><span>And said to them: I see your father's countenance is
    not towards me as yesterday and the other day: but the God of
    my father hath been with me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And you know that I have served your father to the
    utmost of my power.</span></li>

    <li><span>Yea, your father also hath overreached me, and hath
    changes my wages ten times: and yet God hath not suffered him
    to hurt me.</span></li>

    <li><span>If at any time he said: The speckled shall be thy
    wages: all the sheep brought forth speckled: but when he said
    on the contrary: Thou shalt take all the white ones for thy
    wages: all the flocks brought forth white ones.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God hath taken your father's substance, and given
    it to me.</span></li>

    <li><span>For after that time came of the ewes conceiving, I
    lifted up my eyes, and saw in my sleep that the males which
    leaped upon the females were of diverse colors, and spotted,
    and speckled.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the angel of God said to me in my sleep: Jacob?
    And I answered: Here I am.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said: Lift up thy eyes, and see that all the
    males leaping upon the females, are of divers colors, spotted,
    and speckled. For I have seen all that Laban hath done to
    thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>I am the God of Bethel, where thou didst anoint the
    stone, and make a vow to me. Now therefore arise, and go out of
    this land, and return into thy native country.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Rachel and Lia answered: Have we anything left
    among the goods and inheritance of our father's
    house?</span></li>

    <li><span>Hath he not counted us as strangers and sold us, and
    eaten up the price of us?</span></li>

    <li><span>But God hath taken our father's riches, and delivered
    them to us, and to our children: wherefore do all that God hath
    commanded thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Jacob rose up, and having set his children and
    wives upon camels, went his way.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he took all his substance, and flocks, and
    whatsoever he had gotten in Mesopotamia, and went forward to
    Isaac his father to the land of Chanaan.</span></li>

    <li><span>At that time Laban was gone to shear his sheep, and
    Rachel stole away her father's idols.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jacob would not confess to his father in law that
    he was flying away.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he was gone, together with all that belonged
    to him, and having passed the river, was going on towards mount
    Galaad,</span></li>

    <li><span>It was told Laban on the third day that Jacob
    fled.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after
    him seven days; and overtook him in the mount of
    Galaad.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he saw in a dream God saying to him: Take heed
    thou speak not any thing harshly against Jacob.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain: and
    when he with his brethren had overtaken him, he pitched his
    tent in the same mount of Galaad.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to Jacob: Why hast thou done thus, to
    carry away, without my knowledge, my daughters, as captives
    taken with the sword.</span></li>

    <li><span>Why wouldst thou run away privately and not acquaint
    me, that I might have brought thee on the way with joy, and
    with songs, and with timbrels, and with harps?</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and
    daughters: thou hast done foolishly: and now,
    indeed,</span></li>

    <li><span>It is in my power to return thee evil: but the God of
    your father said to me yesterday: Take heed thou speak not any
    things harshly against Jacob.</span></li>

    <li><span>Suppose thou didst desire to go to thy friends, and
    hadst a longing after thy father's house: why hast thou stolen
    away my gods?</span></li>

    <li><span>Jacob answered: That I departed unknown to thee, it
    was for fear lest thou wouldst take away thy daughters by
    force.</span></li>

    <li><span>But whereas thou chargest me with theft: with
    whomsoever thou shalt find thy gods, let him be slain before
    our brethren. Search, and if thou find any of thy things with
    me, take them away. Now when he said this, he knew not that
    Rachel had stolen the idols.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Laban went into the tent of Jacob, and of Lia, and
    of both the handmaids, and found them not. And when he was
    entered into Rachel's tent,</span></li>

    <li><span>She in haste hid the idols under the camel's
    furniture, and sat upon them: and when he had searched all the
    tent, and found nothing,</span></li>

    <li><span>She said: Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise
    up before thee, because it has now happened to me, according to
    the custom of women, So his careful search was in
    vain.</span></li>

    <li><span>And jacob being angry, said in a chiding manner: For
    what fault of mine, and for what offense on my part hast thou
    so hotly pursued me,</span></li>

    <li><span>And searched all my household stuff? What hast thou
    found of all the substance of thy house? lay it here before my
    brethren, and thy brethren, and let them judge between me and
    thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>Have I therefore been with thee twenty years? thy
    ewes and goats were not barren, the rams of thy flocks I did
    not eat:</span></li>

    <li><span>Neither did I show thee that which the beast had
    torn, I made good all the damage: whatsoever was lost by theft,
    thou didst exact it of me:</span></li>

    <li><span>Day and night was I parched with heat, and with
    frost, and sleep departed from my eyes.</span></li>

    <li><span>And in this manner have I served thee in thy house
    twenty years, fourteen for thy daughters, and six for thy
    flocks: thou hast changed also my wages ten times.</span></li>

    <li><span>Unless the God of my father Abraham, and the fear of
    Isaac had stood by me, peradventure now thou hadst sent me away
    naked: God beheld my affliction and the labour of my hands, and
    rebuked thee yesterday.</span></li>

    <li><span>Laban answered him: The daughters are mine and the
    children, and thy flocks, and all things that thou seest are
    mine: what can I do to my children, and
    grandchildren?</span></li>

    <li><span>Come therefore, let us enter into a league: that it
    may be for a testimony between me and thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a
    title:</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to his brethren: Bring hither stones. And
    they gathering stones together, made a heap, and they ate upon
    it.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Laban called it The witness heap: and Jacob, The
    hillock of testimony: each of them according to the propriety
    of his language.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Laban said: This heap shall be a witness between
    me and thee this day, and therefore the name thereof was called
    Galaad, that is, The witness heap.</span></li>

    <li><span>The Lord behold and judge between us when we shall be
    gone one from the other.</span></li>

    <li><span>If thou afflict my daughters, and if thou bring in
    other wives over them: none is witness of our speech but God,
    who is present and beholdeth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said again to Jacob: Behold, this heap, and
    the stone which I have set up between me and thee,</span></li>

    <li><span>Shall be a witness: this heap, I say, and the stone,
    be they for a testimony, if either I shall pass beyond it going
    towards thee, or thou shalt pass beyond it, thinking harm to
    me.</span></li>

    <li><span>The God of Abraham, and the God of Nachor, the God of
    their father, judge between us. And jacob swore by the fear of
    his father Isaac.</span></li>

    <li><span>And after he had offered sacrifices in the mountain,
    he called his brethren to eat bread. And when they had eaten,
    they lodged there:</span></li>

    <li><span>But laban arose in the night, and kissed his sons,
    and daughters, and blessed them: and returned to his
    place.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="32">Genesis 32</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Jacob also went on the journey he had begun: and the
    angels of God met him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he saw them, he said: These are the camps of
    God, and he called the name of that place Mahanaim, that is,
    Camps.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he sent messengers before him to Esau his brother
    to the land of Seir to the country of Edom:</span></li>

    <li><span>And he commanded them, saying: Thus shall ye speak to
    my lord Esau: Thus saith thy brother Jacob: I have sojourned
    with Laban, and have been with him until this day.</span></li>

    <li><span>I have oxen, and asses, and sheep, and menservants,
    and womenservants: and now I send a message to my lord, that I
    may find favor in thy sight.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying: We came
    to Esau thy brother, and behold he cometh with speed to meet
    thee with four hundred men.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Jacob was greatly afraid; and in his fear
    divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and the
    sheep, and the oxen, and the camels, into two
    companies,</span></li>

    <li><span>Saying: If Esau come to one company and destroy it,
    the other company that is left shall escape.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jacob said: O God of my father Abraham, and God
    of my father Isaac, O Lord, who saidst to me: Return to thy
    land and to the place of thy birth, and I will do well for
    thee,</span></li>

    <li><span>I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies, and
    of thy truth which thou hast fulfilled to thy servant. With my
    staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I return with two
    companies.</span></li>

    <li><span>Deliver me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am
    greatly afraid of him: lest perhaps he come, and kill the
    mother with the children.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou didst say that thou wouldst do well by me, and
    multiply my seed like the sand of the sea, which cannot be
    numbered for the multitude.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had slept there that night, he set apart,
    of the things which he had, presents for his brother
    Esau.</span></li>

    <li><span>Two hundred she goats, twenty he goats, two hundred
    ewes, and twenty rams,</span></li>

    <li><span>Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and
    twenty bulls, twenty she asses, and ten of their
    foals.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he sent them by the hands of his servants, every
    drove by itself, and he said to his servants: Go before me, and
    let there be a space between drove and drove.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he commanded the first, saying: If thou meet my
    brother Esau, and he ask thee: Whose art thou? or whither goest
    thou? or whose are these before thee?</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt answer: Thy servant Jacob's: he hath sent
    them as a present to my lord Esau: and he cometh after
    us.</span></li>

    <li><span>In like manner he commanded the second and the third,
    and all that followed with the droves, saying: Speak ye the
    same words to Esau, when ye find him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And ye shall add: thy servant Jacob himself also
    followeth after us: for he said: I will appease him with the
    presents that go before, and afterwards I will see him, perhaps
    he will be gracious to me.</span></li>

    <li><span>So the presents went before him, but himself lodged
    that night in the camp.</span></li>

    <li><span>And rising early he took his two wives, and his two
    handmaids, with his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of
    Jaboc.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when all things were brought over that belonged
    to him,</span></li>

    <li><span>He remained alone: and behold a man wrestled with him
    till morning.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he saw that he could not overcome him, he
    touched the sinew of his thigh, and forthwith it
    shrank.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to him: Let me go, for it is break of
    day. He answered: I will not let thee go except thou bless
    me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said: What is thy name? He answered:
    Jacob.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he said: Thy name shall not be called Jacob, but
    Israel: for if thou hast been strong against God, how much more
    shalt thou prevail against men?</span></li>

    <li><span>Jacob asked him, Tell me by what name art thou
    called? He answered: Why dost thou ask my name? And he blessed
    him in the same place.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jacob called the name of the place Phanuel,
    saying: I have seen God face to face, and my soul has been
    saved.</span></li>

    <li><span>And immediately the sun rose upon him, after he was
    past Phanuel; but he halted on his foot.</span></li>

    <li><span>Therefore the children of Israel, unto this day, eat
    not the sinew, that shrank in Jacob's thigh: because he touched
    the sinew of his thigh and it shrank.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="33">Genesis 33</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And Jacob lifting up his eyes, saw Esau coming, and
    with him four hundred men: and he divided the children of Lia,
    and of Rachel, and of the two handmaids:</span></li>

    <li><span>And he put both the handmaids and their children
    foremost: and Lia and her children in the second place: and
    Rachel and Joseph last.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he went forward and bowed down with his face to
    the ground seven times until his brother came near.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Esau ran to meet his brother, and embraced him:
    and clasping him fast about the neck, and kissing him,
    wept.</span></li>

    <li><span>And lifting up his eyes, he saw the women and their
    children, and said: What mean these? And do they belong to
    thee? He answered: They are the children which God hath given
    to me thy servant.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then the handmaids and their children came near, and
    bowed themselves.</span></li>

    <li><span>Lia also with her children came near, and bowed down
    in like manner, and last of all Joseph and Rachel bowed
    down.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Esau said: What are the droves that I met? He
    answered: That I might find favor before my lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he said: I have plenty, my brother, keep what is
    thine for thyself.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jacob said: Do not so I beseech thee, but if I
    have found favor in thy eyes, receive a little present at my
    hands: for I have seen thy face, as if I should have seen the
    countenance of God: be gracious to me,</span></li>

    <li><span>And take the blessing, which I have brought thee, and
    which God hath given me, who giveth all things. He took it with
    much ado at his brother's earnest pressing him,</span></li>

    <li><span>And said: Let us go on together, and I will accompany
    thee in thy journey.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jacob said: My lord, thou knowest that I have
    with me tender children, and sheep, and kine with young: which
    if I should cause to be overdriven, in one day all the flocks
    will die.</span></li>

    <li><span>May it please my lord to go before his servant: and I
    will follow softly after him, as I shall see my children to be
    able, until I come to my lord in Seir.</span></li>

    <li><span>Esau answered: I beseech thee, that some of the
    people at least, who are with me, may stay to accompany thee in
    the way. And he said: There is no necessity: I want nothing
    else but only to find favor, my lord, in thy sight.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Esau returned, that day, the way that he came, to
    Seir.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jacob came to Socoth: where having built a house,
    and pitched tents, he called the name of the place Socoth, that
    is, Tents.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he passed over to Salem, a city of the
    Sichemites, which is in the land of Chanaan, after he returned
    from Mesopotamia of Syria: and he dwelt by the
    town:</span></li>

    <li><span>And he bought that part of the field, in which he
    pitched his tents, of the children of Hemor, the father of
    Sichem for a hundred lambs.</span></li>

    <li><span>And raising an altar there, he invoked upon it the
    most mighty God of Israel.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="34">Genesis 34</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And Dina the daughter of Lia went out to see the
    women of that country.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Sichem the son of Hemor the Hevite, the
    prince of that land, saw her, he was in love with her: and took
    her away, and lay with her, ravishing the virgin.</span></li>

    <li><span>And his soul was fast knit unto her, and whereas she
    was sad, he comforted her with sweet words.</span></li>

    <li><span>And going to Hemor his father, he said: Get me this
    damsel to wife.</span></li>

    <li><span>But when Jacob had heard this, his sons being absent,
    and employed in feeding the cattle, he held his peace till they
    came back.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Hemor the father of Sichem was come out to
    speak to Jacob,</span></li>

    <li><span>Behold his sons came from the field: and hearing what
    had passed, they were exceeding angry, because he had done a
    foul thing in Israel, and committed an unlawful act, in
    ravishing Jacob's daughter,</span></li>

    <li><span>And Hemor spoke to them: The soul of my son Sichem
    has a longing for your daughter: give her him to
    wife:</span></li>

    <li><span>And let us contract marriages one with another: give
    us your daughters and take you our daughters,</span></li>

    <li><span>And dwell with us: the land is at your command, till,
    trade,and possess it.</span></li>

    <li><span>Sichem also said to her father and to her brethren:
    Let me find favor in your sight: and whatsoever you shall
    appoint I will give.</span></li>

    <li><span>Raise the dowery,, and ask gifts, and I will gladly
    give what you shall demand: only give me this damsel to
    wife.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Jacob answered Sichem and his father
    deceitfully, being enraged at the deflowering of their
    sister:</span></li>

    <li><span>We cannot do what you demand, nor give our sister to
    one that is uncircumcised, which with us is unlawful and
    abominable.</span></li>

    <li><span>But in this way may we be allied with you, if you
    will be like us, and all the male sex among you be
    circumcised:</span></li>

    <li><span>Then will we mutually give and take your daughters,
    and ours: and we will dwell with you, and will be one
    people:</span></li>

    <li><span>But if you will not be circumcised, we will take our
    daughter and depart:</span></li>

    <li><span>Their offer pleased Hemor, and Sichem his
    son:</span></li>

    <li><span>And the young man made no delay, but forthwith
    fulfilled what was required, for he loved the damsel
    exceedingly, and he was the greatest man in all his father's
    house.</span></li>

    <li><span>And going into the gate of the city they spoke to the
    people:</span></li>

    <li><span>These men are peaceable and willing to dwell with us:
    let them trade in the land, and till it, which being large and
    wide wanteth men to till it: we shall take their daughters for
    wives, and we will give them ours.</span></li>

    <li><span>One thing there is for which so great a good is
    deferred: We must circumcise every male among us, following the
    manner of the nation.</span></li>

    <li><span>And their substance, and cattle, and all that they
    possess, shall be ours: only in this let us condescend, and by
    dwelling together, we shall make one people.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they all agreed, and circumcised all the
    males.</span></li>

    <li><span>And behold the third day, when the pain of the wound
    was greatest, two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, the
    brothers of Dina, taking their swords, entered boldly into the
    city, and slew all the men:</span></li>

    <li><span>And they killed also Hemor and Sichem, and took away
    their sister Dina, out of Sichem's house.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they were gone out, the other sons of Jacob
    came upon the slain; and plundered the city in revenge of the
    rape.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they took their sheep and their herds and their
    asses, wasting all they had in their houses and in the
    fields.</span></li>

    <li><span>and their children and wives they took
    captive,</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they had boldly perpetrated these things,
    Jacob said to Simeon and Levi: You have troubled me, and made
    me hateful to the Chanaanites and Pherezites, the inhabitants
    of this land: we are few: they will gather themselves together
    and kill me; and both I, and my house, shall be
    destroyed.</span></li>

    <li><span>They answered: Should they abuse our sister as a
    strumpet?</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="35">Genesis 35</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>In the meantime God said to Jacob: Arise, and go up
    to Bethel, and dwell there, and make there an altar to God, who
    appeared to thee when thou didst flee from Esau thy
    brother.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jacob having called together all his household,
    said: Cast away the strange gods that are among you, and be
    cleansed and change your garments.</span></li>

    <li><span>Arise, and let us go up to Bethel, that we may make
    there an altar to God: who heard me in the day of my
    affliction, and accompanied me in my journey.</span></li>

    <li><span>So they gave him all the strange gods they had, and
    the earrings which were in their ears: and he buried them under
    the turpentine tree, that is behind the city of
    Sichem.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they were departed, the terror of God fell
    upon all the cities round about, and they durst not pursue
    after them as they went away.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jacob came to Luza, which is in the land of
    Chanaan, surnamed Bethel: he and all the people that were with
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he built there an altar, and called the name of
    that place, The house of God: for there God appeared to him
    when he fled from his brother.</span></li>

    <li><span>At the same time Debora the nurse of Rebecca died,
    and was buried at the foot of Bethel under an oak: and the name
    of that place was called, The oak of weeping.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God appeared again to Jacob, after he returned
    from Mesopotamia of Syria, and he blessed him,</span></li>

    <li><span>Saying: Thou shalt not be called any more Jacob, but
    Israel shall be thy name. And he called him Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And said to him: I am God Almighty, increase thou and
    be multiplied. Nations and peoples of nations shall be from
    thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I
    will give to thee, and to thy seed after thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he departed from him.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he set up a monument of stone, in the place where
    God had spoken to him: pouring drink offerings upon it, and
    pouring oil thereon:</span></li>

    <li><span>And calling the name of that place
    Bethel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And going forth from thence, he came in the
    springtime to the land which leadeth to Ephrata: wherein when
    Rachel was in travail,</span></li>

    <li><span>By reason of her hard labor she began to be in
    danger, and the midwife said to her: Fear not, for thou shalt
    have this son also.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when her soul was departing for pain, and death
    was now at hand, she called the name of her son Benoni, that
    is, The son of my pain: but his father called him Benjamin,
    that is, The son of the right hand.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Rachel died, and was buried in the highway that
    leadeth to Ephrata, that is Bethlehem.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jacob erected a pillar over her sepulcher: this
    is the pillar of Rachel's monument, to this day.</span></li>

    <li><span>Departing thence, he pitched his tent beyond the
    Flock tower.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he dwelt in that country, Ruben went, and
    slept with Bala, the concubine of his father: which he was not
    ignorant of. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Lia: Ruben the firstborn, and Simeon, and
    Levi, and Juda, and Issachar, and Zebulon.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Bala, Rachel's handmaid: Dan and
    Naphthali.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Zelpha, Lia's handmaid: Gad and Aser:
    these are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in
    Mesopotamia of Syria.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he came to Isaac his father in Mambre, the city
    of Arbee, this is Hebron: Wherein Abraham and Isaac
    sojourned.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty
    years.</span></li>

    <li><span>And being spent with age he died, and was gathered to
    his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and
    Jacob buried him.</span></li>

    all that he was able to acquire in the land of Chanaan: and
    went into another country, and departed from his brother

    Base- math the wife of Esau.</span></li>

    <li><span>And these the sons of Oolibama the wife of Esau: duke
    Jehus, duke Ihelon, duke Core. These are the dukes of Oolibama,
    the daughter of Ana, and wife of Esau.</span></li>

    <li><span>These are the sons of Esau, and these the dukes of
    them: the same is Edom.</span></li>

    <li><span>These are the sons of Seir the Horrite, the
    inhabitants of the land: Lotan, and Sobal, and Sebeon, and
    Ana,</span></li>

    <li><span>And Dison, and Eser, and Disan. These are dukes of
    the Horrites, the sons of Seir in the land of Edom.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Lotan had sons: Hori and Heman. And the sister of
    Lotan was Thamna.</span></li>

    <li><span>And these the sons of Sobal: Alvan and Manahat, and
    Ebal, and Sepho, and Oman.</span></li>

    <li><span>And these the sons of Sebeon: Aia and Ana. This is
    Ana that found the hot waters in the wilderness, when he fed
    the asses of Sebeon his father:</span></li>

    <li><span>And he had a son Dison, and a daughter
    Oolibama.</span></li>

    <li><span>And these were the sons of Dison: Hamdan, and Eseban,
    and Jethram, and Charan.</span></li>

    <li><span>These also were the sons of Eser: Balaan, and Zavan,
    and Acan.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Disan had sons : Hus, and Aram.</span></li>

    <li><span>These were dukes of the Horrites: duke Lotan, duke
    Sobal, duke Sebeon, duke Ana,</span></li>

    <li><span>Duke Dison, duke Eser, duke Disan: these were dukes
    of the Horrites that ruled in the land of Seir.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the kings that ruled in the land of Edom, before
    the children of Israel had a king were these:</span></li>

    <li><span>Bela the son of Beer, and the name of his city
    Denaba.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zara of Bosra
    reigned in his stead.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Jobab was dead, Husam of the land of the
    Themanites reigned in his stead.</span></li>

    <li><span>And after his death, Adad the son of Badad reigned in
    his stead, who defeated the Madianites in the country of Moab:
    and the name of his city was Avith.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Adad was dead, there reigned in his stead,
    Semla of Masreca.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he being dead, Saul of the river Rohoboth,
    reigned in his stead.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he also was dead, Balanan the son of Achobor
    succeeded to the kingdom.</span></li>

    <li><span>This man also being dead, Adar reigned in his place,
    and the name of his city was Phau: and his wife was called
    Meetabel, the daughter of Matred, daughter of
    Mezaab.</span></li>

    <li><span>And these are the names of the dukes of Esau in their
    kindreds, and places, and callings: duke Thamna, duke Alva,
    duke Jetheth,</span></li>

    <li><span>Duke Oolibama, duke Ela, duke Phinon,</span></li>

    <li><span>Duke Cenez, duke Theman, duke Mabsar,</span></li>

    <li><span>Duke Magdiel, duke Hiram: these are the dukes of Edom
    dwelling in the land of their government; the same is Esau the
    father of the Edomites.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="37">Genesis 37</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And Jacob dwelt in the land of Chanaan wherein his
    father sojourned.</span></li>

    <li><span>And these are his generations: Joseph, when he was
    sixteen years old, was feeding the dock with his brethren,
    being but a boy: and he was with the sons of and of Zelpha his
    father's wives : and he accused his brethren to his father of a
    most wicked crime.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now Israel loved Joseph above all his sons, because
    he had him in his old age: and he made him a coat of divers
    colours.</span></li>

    <li><span>And his brethren seeing that he was loved by his
    father, more than all his sons, hated him, and could not speak
    peaceably to him.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now it fell out also that he told his brethren a
    dream, that he had dreamed: which occasioned them to hate him
    the more.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to them: Hear my dream which I
    dreamed.</span></li>

    <li><span>I thought we were binding sheaves in the field: and
    my sheaf arose as it were, end stood, and your sheaves standing
    about, bowed down before my sheaf.</span></li>

    <li><span>His brethren answered : Shalt thou be our king? or
    shall we be subject to thy dominion? Therefore this matter of
    his dreams and words ministered nourishment to their envy and
    hatred.</span></li>

    <li><span>He dreamed also another dream, which he told his
    brethren, saying: I saw in a dream, as it were the sun, and the
    moon, and eleven stars worshipping me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had told this to his father and brethren,
    his father rebuked him, and said: What meaneth this dream that
    thou hast dreamed? shall I and thy mother, and thy brethren
    worship thee upon the earth?</span></li>

    <li><span>His brethren therefore envied him: but his father
    considered the thing with himself.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when his brethren abode in Sichem feeding their
    father's docks,</span></li>

    <li><span>Israel said to him : Thy brethren feed the sheep in
    Sichem: come, I will send thee to them. And when he
    answered:</span></li>

    <li><span>I am ready: he said to him: Go, and see if all things
    be well with thy brethren, and the cattle: and bring me word
    again what is doing. So being sent from the vale of Hebron, he
    came to Sichem:</span></li>

    <li><span>And a man found him there wandering in the field, and
    asked what he sought.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he answered: I seek my brethren; tell me where
    they feed the docks.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the man said to him: They are departed from this
    place: for I heard them say: Let us go to Dothain. And Joseph
    went forward after his brethren, and found them in
    Dothain.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they saw him afar off, be- fore he came nigh
    them, they thought to kill him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And said one to another: Behold the dreamer
    cometh.</span></li>

    <li><span>Come, let us kill him, and cast him into some old pit
    : and we will say : Some evil beast hath devoured him: and then
    it shall appear what his dreams avail him :</span></li>

    <li><span>And Ruben hearing this, endeavoured to deliver him
    out of their hands, end said:</span></li>

    <li><span>Do not take away his life, nor shed his blood: but
    cast him into this pit, that is in the wilderness, and keep
    your hands harmless: now he said this, being desirous to
    deliver him out of their hands and to restore him to his
    father.</span></li>

    <li><span>And as soon as he came to his brethren, they
    forthwith stript him of his outside coat, that was of divers
    colours:</span></li>

    <li><span>And cast him into an old pit, where there was no
    water.</span></li>

    <li><span>And sitting down to eat bread, they saw some
    Ismaelites on their way coming from Calaad, with their camels,
    carrying spices, and balm, and myrrh to Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Juda said to his brethren: What will it profit us
    to kill our brother, and conceal his blood?</span></li>

    <li><span>It is better that he be sold to the Ismaelites, and
    that our hands be not defiled: for he is our brother and our
    flesh. His brethren agreed to his words.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the Madianite merchants passed by, they drew
    him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ismaelites, for twenty
    pieces of silver: and they led him into Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Ruben, returning to the pit, found not the
    boy:</span></li>

    <li><span>And rending his garments he went to his brethren, and
    said: The boy doth not appear and whither shall I
    go?</span></li>

    <li><span>And they took his coat, and dipped it in the blood of
    a kid, which they had killed :</span></li>

    <li><span>Sending some to carry it to their father, and to say:
    This we have found: see whether it be thy son's coat, or
    not.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the father acknowledging it, said: It is my son's
    coat, an evil wild beast hath eaten him, a beast hath devoured
    Joseph.</span></li>

    <li><span>And tearing his garments, he put an sackcloth,
    mourning for his son a long time.</span></li>

    <li><span>And alibis children being gathered together to
    comfort their father in his sorrow, he would not receive
    comfort, but said: I will go down to my son into hell,
    mourning. And whilst he continued weeping,</span></li>

    <li><span>The Madianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Putiphar, an
    eunuch of Pharao, captain of the soldiers.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="38">Genesis 38</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>At that time Juda went down from his brethren, and
    turned in to a certain Odollamite, named Hiras.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he saw there the daughter of a man of Chanaan,
    called Sue: and taking her to wife, he went in unto
    her.</span></li>

    <li><span>And she conceived, and bore a son, and called his
    name Her.</span></li>

    <li><span>And conceiving again, she bore a son, and called him
    Onan.</span></li>

    <li><span>She bore also a third: whom she called Sela. after
    whose birth, she ceased to bear any more.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Juda took a wife for Her his firstborn, whose
    name was Thamar.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Her, the firstborn of Juda, was wicked in the
    sight of the Lord: and was slain by him.</span></li>

    <li><span>Juda, therefore add to Onan his son: Go in to thy
    brother's wife and marry her, that thou mayst raise seed to thy
    brother.</span></li>

    <li><span>He knowing that the children should not be his, when
    he went in to his brother's wife, spilled his seed upon the
    ground, lest children should be born in his brother's
    name.</span></li>

    <li><span>And therefore the Lord slew him, be- cause he did a
    detestable thing.</span></li>

    <li><span>Wherefore Juda said to Thamar his daughter in law:
    Remain a widow in thy father's house, till Sela my son grow up:
    for he was afraid lest he also might die, as his brethren did.
    She went her way and dwelt in her father's house.</span></li>

    <li><span>And after many days were past, the daughter of Sue
    the wife of Juda died: and when he had taken comfort after his
    mourning, he went up to Thamnas, to the shearers of his sheep,
    he and Hiras the Odollamite the shepherd of his
    flock.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it was told Thamar that her father in law was
    come up to Thamnas to shear his sheep.</span></li>

    <li><span>And she put off the garments of her widowhood, and
    took a veil: and changing her dress, sat in the cross way, that
    leadeth to Thamnas: because Sela was grown up, and she had not
    been married to him.</span></li>

    <li><span>When Juda saw her, he thought she was a harlot: for
    she had covered her face, lest she should be known.</span></li>

    <li><span>And going to her, he said: Suffer me to lie with
    thee: for he knew her not to be his daughter in law. And she
    answered: What wilt thou give me to en joy my
    company?</span></li>

    <li><span>He said: I will send thee a kid out of the flock. And
    when she said again: I will suffer what thou wilt, if thou give
    a pledge, till thou send what thou promisest,</span></li>

    <li><span>Juda said: What wilt thou have for a pledge ? She
    answered: Thy ring and bracelet, and the staff which thou
    holdest in thy hand. The woman therefore at one copulation
    conceived.</span></li>

    <li><span>And she arose and went her way: and putting off the
    apparel which she had taken, put on the garments of her
    widowhood.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Juda sent a kid by his shepherd, the Odollamite,
    that he might receive the pledge again, which he had given to
    the woman: but he, not finding her,</span></li>

    <li><span>asked the men of that place : Where is the woman that
    sat in the cross way? And when they all made answer: There was
    no harlot in this place,</span></li>

    <li><span>He returned to Juda, and said to him: I have not
    found her; moreover the men of that place said to me, that
    there never sat a harlot there.</span></li>

    <li><span>Juda said : Let her take it to herself ; surely she
    cannot charge us with a,lie: I sent the kid which I promised:
    and thou didst not find her.</span></li>

    <li><span>And behold after three months they told a lie,
    saying: Thamar, thy daughter in law hath played the harlot, and
    she appeareth to have a big belly. And Juda said : Bring her
    out that she may be burnt.</span></li>

    <li><span>But when she was led to execution, she sent to her
    father in law, saying: By the man, to whom these things belong,
    I am with child. See whose ring, and bracelet, and staff this
    is.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he acknowledging the gifts, said: She is juster
    than I: because I did not give her to Sela, my son. However, he
    knew her no more.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when she was ready to be brought to bed, there
    appeared twins in her womb: and in the very delivery of the
    infants, one put forth a hand, whereon the midwife tied a
    scarlet thread, saying:</span></li>

    <li><span>This shall come forth the first.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he drawing back his hand, the other came forth:
    and the woman said: Why is the partition divided for thee? and
    therefore called his name Phares.</span></li>

    <li><span>Afterwards his brother came out, on whose hand was
    the scarlet thread: and she called him Zara.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="39">Genesis 39</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And Joseph was brought into Egypt, and Putiphar an
    eunuch of Pharao, chief captain of the army, an Egyptian,
    bought him of the Ismaelites, by whom he was
    brought.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord was with him, and he was a prosperous
    man in all things: and he dwelt in his master's
    house,</span></li>

    <li><span>Who knew very well that the Lord was with him, and
    made all that he did to prosper in his hand.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Joseph found favour in the sight of his master,
    and ministered to him: and being set over all by him, he
    governed the house committed to him, and all things that were
    delivered to him:</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord blessed the house of the Egyptian for
    Joseph's sake, and multiplied all his substance, both at home,
    and in the fields.</span></li>

    <li><span>h And after many days his mistress 'cast her eyes on
    Joseph, and said: Lie with me.</span></li>

    <li><span>Neither knew he any other thing, but the bread which
    he ate. And Joseph was of a beautiful countenance, and comely
    to behold.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he, in no wise consenting to that wicked act,
    said to her: Behold, my master hath delivered all things to me,
    and knoweth not what he hath in his own house:</span></li>

    <li><span>Neither is there any thing which is hot in my power,
    or that he hath not delivered to me, but thee, who art his wife
    : how then can I do this wicked thing, and I sin against my
    God?</span></li>

    <li><span>With such words as these day by day, both the woman
    was importunate with the young man, and he refused the
    adultery.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now it happened on it certain day, that Joseph went
    into the house, and was doing some business without any, man
    with him:</span></li>

    <li><span>And she catching the skirt of his garment, said: Lie
    with me. But he leaving the garment in her hand, fled, and went
    out.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the woman saw the garment in her hands, and
    herself disregarded,</span></li>

    <li><span>She called to her the men of her house, and said to
    them: See, he hath brought in a Hebrew, to abuse us: he came in
    to me, to lie with me : and when I cried out,</span></li>

    <li><span>And he heard my voice, he left the garment that I
    held, and got him out.</span></li>

    <li><span>For a proof therefore of her fidelity, she kept the
    garment, and shewed it to her husband when he returned
    home:</span></li>

    <li><span>And said: The Hebrew servant, whom thou best brought,
    came to me to abuse me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he heard me cry, he left the garment which I
    held, and fled out.</span></li>

    <li><span>His master hearing these things, and giving too much
    credit to his wife's words, was very angry.</span></li>

    <li><span>And cast Joseph into the prison, where the king's
    prisoners were kept, and he was there shut up.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the Lord was with Joseph and having mercy upon
    him gave him favour in the sight of the chief keeper of the
    prison:</span></li>

    <li><span>Who delivered into his hand all the prisoners that
    were kept in custody: and whatsoever was done was under
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>Neither did he himself know any thing, having
    committed all things to him: for the Lord was with him, and
    made all that he did to prosper.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="40">Genesis 40</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>After this, it came to pass, that two eunuchs, the
    butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, offended their
    lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Pharao being angry with them (now the one was
    chief butler, the other chief baker)</span></li>

    <li><span>He sent them to the prison of the commander of the
    soldiers, in which Joseph also was prisoner,</span></li>

    <li><span>But the keeper of the prison delivered them to
    Joseph, and he served them. Some little time passed, and they
    were kept in custody.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they both dreamed a dream the same night,
    according to the interpretation agreeing to
    themselves:</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Joseph was come in to them in the morning,
    and saw them sad,</span></li>

    <li><span>He asked them, saying: Why is your oountenance sadder
    to day than usual?</span></li>

    <li><span>They answered: We have dreamed a dream, and there is
    nobody to interpret it to us. And Joseph said to them: Both not
    interpretation belong to God? Tell me what you have dreamed. g
    The chief butler first told his dream: I saw before me a
    vine,</span></li>

    <li><span>On which were three branches, which by little and
    little sent out buds, and after the blossoms brought forth ripe
    grapes :</span></li>

    <li><span>And the cup of Pharao was in my hand: and I took the
    grapes, and pressed them into the cup which I held, and I gave
    the cup to Pharao.</span></li>

    <li><span>Joseph answered: This is the interpretation of the
    dream: The three branches are yet three days:</span></li>

    <li><span>After which Pharao will remember thy service, and
    will restore thee to thy former place: and thou shah present
    him the cup according to thy office, as before thou wast wont
    to do.</span></li>

    <li><span>Only remember me, when it shall be well with thee,
    and do me this kindness: to put Pharao in mind to take me out
    of this prison:</span></li>

    <li><span>For I was stolen away out of the land I of the
    Hebrews, and here without any fault was cast into the
    dungeon.</span></li>

    <li><span>The chief baker seeing that he had wisely interpreted
    the dream, said: I also dreamed a dream, That I bed three
    baskets of meal upon my heed:</span></li>

    <li><span>And that in one basket which was uppermost, I carried
    all meats that are made by the art of baking, and that the
    birds ate out of it.</span></li>

    <li><span>Joseph answered: This is the interpretation of the
    dream: The three baskets are yet three days:</span></li>

    <li><span>After which Pharao will take thy hand from thee, and
    hang thee on a cross, and the birds shall tear thy
    flesh.</span></li>

    <li><span>The third day after this was the birthday of Pharao:
    and he made a. great feast for his servants, and at the banquet
    remembered the chief butler, and the chief baker.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he restored the one to his place to present him
    the cup:</span></li>

    <li><span>The other he hanged on a gibbet, that the truth of
    the interpreter might be shewn.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the chief butler, when things prospered with him,
    forgot his interpreter.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="41">Genesis 41</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>After two years Pharao had a dream. He thought he
    stood by the river,</span></li>

    <li><span>Out of which came up seven kine, very beautiful and
    fat: and they fed in marshy places.</span></li>

    <li><span>Other seven also came up out of the river, ill
    favoured, and leanfleshed: and they fed on the very bank of the
    river, in green places:</span></li>

    <li><span>And they devoured them, whose bodies were very
    beautiful and well conditioned. So Pharao awoke.</span></li>

    <li><span>He slept again, and dreamed another dream: Seven ears
    of corn came up upon one stalk full and fair:</span></li>

    <li><span>Then seven other ears sprung up thin and
    blasted,</span></li>

    <li><span>And devoured all the beauty of the former. Pharao
    awaked after his rest:</span></li>

    <li><span>And when morning was come, being struck with fear, he
    sent to all the interpreters of Egypt, and to all the wise men:
    and they being called for, he told them his dream, and there
    was not any one that could interpret it.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then at length the chief butler remembering, said: I
    confess my sin:</span></li>

    <li><span>The king being angry with his servants, commanded me
    and the chief baker to be cast into the prison of the captain
    of the soldiers:</span></li>

    <li><span>Where in one night both of us dreamed a dream
    foreboding things to come.</span></li>

    <li><span>There was there a young man a Hebrew, servant to the
    same captain of the soldiers: to whom we told our
    dreams,</span></li>

    <li><span>And we heard what afterwards the event of the thing
    proved to be so. For I was restored to my office: and he was
    hanged upon a gibbet.</span></li>

    <li><span>Forthwith at the king's command, Joseph was brought
    out of the prison, and they shaved him, and changing his
    apparel, brought him in to him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to him: I have dreamed dreams, and there
    is no one that can expound them: Now I have heard that thou art
    very wise at interpreting them.</span></li>

    <li><span>Joseph answered: Without me, God shall give Pharao a
    prosperous answer.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Pharao told what he had dreamed: Methought I stood
    upon the bank of the river,</span></li>

    <li><span>And seven kine came up out of the river exceeding
    beautiful and full of flesh: and they grazed on green places in
    a marshy pasture.</span></li>

    <li><span>And behold, there followed these, other seven kine,
    so very ill favoured and lean, that I never saw the like in the
    land of Egypt:</span></li>

    <li><span>And the devoured and consumed the former,</span></li>

    <li><span>And yet gave no mark of their being full: but were as
    lean and ill favoured as before. I awoke, and then fell asleep
    again,</span></li>

    <li><span>And dreamed a dream: Seven ears of corn grew upon one
    stalk, full and very fair.</span></li>

    <li><span>Other seven also thin and blasted, sprung of the
    stock:</span></li>

    <li><span>And they devoured the beauty of the former: I told
    this dream to the conjecturers, and there is no man that can
    expound it.</span></li>

    <li><span>Joseph answered: The king's dream is one: God hath
    shewn to Pharao what he is about to do.</span></li>

    <li><span>The seven beautiful kine, and the seven full ears,
    are seven years of plenty: and both contain the same meaning of
    the dream.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the seven lean and thin kine that came up after
    them, and the seven thin ears that were blasted with the
    burning wind, are seven years of famine to come:</span></li>

    <li><span>Which shall be fulfilled in this order:</span></li>

    <li><span>Behold, there shall come seven years of great plenty
    in the whole land of Egypt:</span></li>

    <li><span>After which shall follow other seven years of so
    great scacity, that all the abundance before shall be
    forgotten: for the famine shall consume all the
    land,</span></li>

    <li><span>And the greatness of the scarcity shall destroy the
    greatness of the plenty.</span></li>

    <li><span>And for that thou didst see the second time a dream
    pertaining to the same thing: it is a token of the certainty,
    and that the word of God cometh to pass, and is fulfilled
    speedily.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now therefore let the king provide a wise and
    industrious man, and make him ruler over the land of
    Egypt:</span></li>

    <li><span>That he may appoint overseers over all the countries:
    and gather into barns the fifth part of the fruits, during the
    seven fruitful years,</span></li>

    <li><span>That shall now presently ensue: and let all the corn
    be laid up under Pharao's hands and be reserved in the
    cities.</span></li>

    <li><span>And let it be in readiness, against the famine of
    seven years to come, which shall oppress Egypt, and the land
    shall not consumed with scarcity.</span></li>

    <li><span>The counsel pleased Pharao and all his
    servants.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to them: Can we find such another man,
    that is full of the spirit of God?</span></li>

    <li><span>He said therefore to Joseph: Seeing God hath shewn
    thee all that thou hast said, can I find one wiser and one like
    unto thee?</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt be over my house, and at the commandment
    of thy mouth all the people shall obey: only in the kingly
    throne will I be above thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>And again Pharao said to Joseph: Behold, I have
    appointed thee over the whole land of Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he took his ring from his own hand, and gave it
    into his hand: and he put upon him a robe of silk, and put a
    chain of gold about his neck.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he made him go up into his second chariot, the
    crier proclaiming that all should bow their knee before him,
    and that they should know he was made govenor over the whole
    land of Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the king said to Joseph: I am Pharao; without thy
    commandment no man shall move hand or foot in all the land of
    Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he turned his name, and called him in the
    Eyyptian tounge, The saviour of the world. And he gave him to
    wife Asenth the daughter of Putiphare priest of Heliopolis.
    Then Joseph went out to the land of Egypt:</span></li>

    <li><span>(Now he was thirty years old when he stood before
    king Pharao) and he went round all the countries of
    Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the fruitfulness of the seven years came: and the
    corm being bound up into sheaves was gathered together into the
    barns of Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the abundance of grain was laid up in every
    city.</span></li>

    <li><span>And there was so great abundance of wheat, that it
    was equal to the sand of the sea, and the plenty exceeded
    measure.</span></li>

    <li><span>And before the famine came, Joseph had two sons born:
    whom Aseneth the daughter of Putiphare priest of Heliopolis
    bore unto him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he called the name of the first born Manasses,
    saying: God hath made me to forget all my labours, and my
    father's house.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he named the second Epharaim, saying: God hath
    made me to grow in the land of my poverty.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now when the seven years of the plenty that had been
    in Egypt were past:</span></li>

    <li><span>The seven years of scarcity, which Joseph had
    foretold, began to come: and the famine prevailed in the whole
    world, but there was bread in all the land of
    Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when there also they began to be famished, the
    people cried to Pharao for food. And he said to them: Go to
    Joseph: and do all that he shall say to you.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the famine increased daily in all the land: and
    Joseph opened all the barns, and sold to the Egyptians: for the
    famine had oppressed them also.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all provinces came into Egypt, to buy food, and
    to seek some relief of their want.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="42">Genesis 42</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And Jacob hearing that food was sold in Egypt, said
    to his sons: Why are ye careless?</span></li>

    <li><span>I have heard that wheat is sold in Egypt: go ye down,
    and buy us necessaries, that we may live, and not be consumed
    with want.</span></li>

    <li><span>So the ten brethren of Joseph went down, to buy corn
    in Egypt:</span></li>

    <li><span>Whilst Benjamin was kept at home by Jacob, who said
    to his brethren: Lest perhaps he take any harm in the
    journey.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they entered into the land of Egypt with others
    that went to buy. For the famine was in the land of
    Chanaan.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Joseph was governor in the land of Egypt, and
    corn was sold by his direction to the people. And when his
    brethren had bowed down to him,</span></li>

    <li><span>And he knew them, he spoke as it were to strangers
    somewhat roughly, asking them: Whence came you? They answered:
    From the land of Chanaan, to buy necessaries of
    life.</span></li>

    <li><span>And though he knew his brethren, he was not known by
    them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And remembering the dreams, which formerly he had
    dreamed, he said to them: You are spies. You are come to view
    the weaker parts of the land.</span></li>

    <li><span>But they said: It is not so, my lord, but thy
    servants are come to buy food.</span></li>

    <li><span>We are all the sons of one man: we are come as
    peaceable men, neither do thy servants go about any
    evil.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he answered them: It is otherwise: you are come
    to consider the unfenced parts of this land.</span></li>

    <li><span>But they said: We thy servants are twelve brethren,
    the sons of one man in the land of Chanaan: the youngest is
    with our father, the other is not living.</span></li>

    <li><span>He saith: This is it that I said: You are
    spies.</span></li>

    <li><span>I shall now presently try what you are: by the health
    of Pharao you shall not depart hence, until your youngest
    brother come.</span></li>

    <li><span>Send one of you to fetch him: and you shall be in
    prison, till what you have said be proved, whether it be true
    or false: or else by the health of Pharao you are
    spies.</span></li>

    <li><span>So he put them in prison three days.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the third day he brought them out of prison, and
    said: Do as I have said, and you shall live: for I fear
    God.</span></li>

    <li><span>If you be peaceable men, let one of your brethren be
    bound in prison: and go ye your ways and carry the corn that
    you have bought, unto your houses.</span></li>

    <li><span>And bring your youngest brother to me, that I may
    find your words to be true, and you may not die. They did as he
    had said.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they talked one to another: We deserve to suffer
    these things, because we have sinned against our brother,
    seeing the anguished of his soul, when he besought us, and we
    would not hear: therefore is this affliction come upon
    us.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Ruben one of them, said: Did not I say to you: Do
    not sin against the boy: and you would not hear me? Behold his
    blood is required.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they knew not that Joseph understood, because he
    spoke to them by an interpreter.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he turned himself away a little while, and wept:
    and returning he spoke to them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And taking Simeon, and binking him in their presence,
    he commanded his servants to fill their sacks with wheat, and
    to put every man's money again in their sacks, and to give them
    besides provisions for the way: and they did so.</span></li>

    <li><span>But they having loaded their asses with the corn,
    went their way.</span></li>

    <li><span>And one of them opening his sack, to give his beast
    provender in the inn, saw the money in the sack's
    mouth;</span></li>

    <li><span>And said to his brethren: My money is given me again,
    hehold it is in the sack. And thye were astonished, and
    troubled, and said to one another: What is this that God hath
    done unto us?</span></li>

    <li><span>And they came to Jacob their father in the land of
    Chanaan, and they told him all things that had befallen them,
    saying:</span></li>

    <li><span>The lord of the land spoke roughly to us, and took us
    to be spies of the country.</span></li>

    <li><span>And we answered him: We are peaceable men, and we
    mean no plot.</span></li>

    <li><span>We are twelve brethren born of one father: one is not
    living, the youngest is with our father in the land of
    Chanaan.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to us: Hereby shall I know that you are
    peaceable men: Leave one of your brethren with me, and take ye
    necessary provision for your houses, and go your
    ways.</span></li>

    <li><span>And bring your youngest brother to me, that I may
    know you are not spies: and you may receive this man again,
    that is kept in prison: and afterwards may have leave to buy
    what you will.</span></li>

    <li><span>When they had told this, they poured out their corn
    and every man found his money tied in the mouth of his sack:
    and all being astonished together,</span></li>

    <li><span>Their father Jacob said: You have made me to be
    without children: Joseph is not living, Simeon is kept in
    bonds, and Benjamin you will take away: all these evils are
    fallen upon me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Ruben answered him: Kill my two sons if I bring
    him not again to thee: deliver him unto my hand, and I will
    restore him to thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he said: My son shall not go down with you: his
    brother is dead, and he is left alone: if any mischief befall
    him in the land to which you go, you will bring down my gray
    hairs with sorrow to hell.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="43">Genesis 43</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>In the mean time the famine was heavy upon all the
    land.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they had eaten up all the corn, which they
    had brought out of Egypt, Jacob said to his sons: Go again and
    buy us a little food.</span></li>

    <li><span>Juda answered: The man declared unto us with the
    atteststion of an oath, saying: You shall not see my face,
    unless you bring your youngest brother with you.</span></li>

    <li><span>If therefore thou wilt send him with us, we will set
    out together, and will buy necessaries for thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>But if thou wilt not, we will not go: for the man, as
    we have often said, declared unto us, saying: You shall not see
    my face without your youngest brother.</span></li>

    <li><span>Israel said to them: You have done this for my misery
    in that you told him you had also another brother.</span></li>

    <li><span>But they answered: The man asked us in order
    concerning our kindred: if our father lived: if we had a
    brother: and we answered him regularly, according to what he
    demanded: Bring hither your brother with you?</span></li>

    <li><span>And Juda said to his father: Send the bou with me,
    that we may set forward, and may live: lest both we and our
    children perish.</span></li>

    <li><span>I take the boy upon me, require him at my hand:
    unless I bring him again, and restore him to thee, I will be
    guilty of sin against thee for ever.</span></li>

    <li><span>If delay had not been made, we had been here again
    the second time.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Israel said to them: If it must needs be so, do
    what you will: take of the best fruits of the land in your
    vessels, and carry down presents to the man, a little balm, and
    honey, and storax, myrrh, turpentine, and almonds.</span></li>

    <li><span>And take with you double money, and carry back what
    you found in your sacks, lest perhaps it was done by
    mistake.</span></li>

    <li><span>And take also your brother, and go to the
    man.</span></li>

    <li><span>And may my almighty Bod make him favourable to you;
    and send back with you your brother, whom he keepeth, and this
    Benjamin: and as for me I shall be desolate without
    children.</span></li>

    <li><span>So the men took the presents, and double money, and
    Benjamin: and went down into Egypt, and stood before
    Joseph.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had seen them, and Benjamin with them, he
    commanded the steward of his house, saying: Bring in the men
    into the house, and kill victims, and prepare a feast: because
    they shall eat with me at noon.</span></li>

    <li><span>He did as he was commanded, and brought the men into
    the house.\</span></li>

    <li><span>And they being much afraid, said there one to
    another: Because of the money, which we carried back the first
    time in our sacks, we are brought in: that he may bring upon us
    a false accusation, and by violence make slaves of us and our
    asses.</span></li>

    <li><span>Wherefore going up to the steward of the house, at
    the door,</span></li>

    <li><span>They said: Sir, we desire thee to hear us: We came
    down once before to buy food:</span></li>

    <li><span>And when we had bought, and come to the inn, we
    opened our sacks, and found our money in the mouths of the
    sacks: which we have now brought again in the same
    weight.</span></li>

    <li><span>And we have brought other money besides, to buy what
    we want: we cannot tell who put it in our bags.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he answered: Peace be with you, fear not: your
    God, and the God of your Father hath given you treasure in your
    sacks. For the money, which you gave me, I have for good. And
    he brought Simeon out to them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And having brought them into the house, he fetched
    water, and they washed their feet, and he gave provender to
    their asses.</span></li>

    <li><span>But they made ready the presents, against Joseph came
    at noon: for they had heard that they should eat bread
    there.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Joseph came into his house, and they offered him
    the presents holding them in their hands, and they bowed down
    with their face to the ground.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he, courteously saluting them again, asked them,
    saying: Is the old man your father in health, of whom uou told
    me? Is he yet living?</span></li>

    <li><span>And they answered: Thy servant our father is in
    health, he is yet living. And bowing themselves they made
    obeisance to him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Joseph lifting up his eyes, saw Benjamin his
    brother, by the same mother, and said: Is this your young
    brother, of whom you told me? And he said: God be gracious to
    thee, my son.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he made haste becouse his heart was moved upon
    his brother, and tears gushed out: And going into his chamber
    he wept.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had washed his face, coming out again, he
    refrained himself, and said: Set bread on the
    table.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when it was set on, for Joseph apart, and for his
    brethren apart, for the Egyptians also that ate with him,
    apart, (for it is unlawful for the Egyptians to eat with the
    Hebrews, and they think such a feast profane:)</span></li>

    <li><span>They sat before him, the firstborn according to his
    birthright, and the youngest according to his age. And they
    wondered very much:</span></li>

    <li><span>Taking the messes which they received of him: and the
    greater mess came to Benjamin, so that it exceeded by five
    parts. And they drank, and were merry with him.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="44">Genesis 44</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And Joseph commanded the steward of his house,
    saying: Fill their sacks with corn, as much as they can hold:
    and put the money of every one in the top of his
    sack.</span></li>

    <li><span>And in the mouth of the younger's sack put my silver
    cup, and the price which he gave for the wheat. And it was so
    done.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the morning arose, they were sent away with
    their asses.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they were now departed out of the city, and
    had gone forward a little way; Joseph sendingfor the steward of
    his house, said: Arise, and pursue after the men: and when thou
    hast overtaken them, say to them: Why have you returned evil
    for good?</span></li>

    <li><span>The cup which you have stolen is that in which my
    lord drinketh, and in which he is wont to divine: you have done
    a very evil thing.</span></li>

    <li><span>He did as he had commanded him. And having overtaken
    them, he spoke to them the same words.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they answered: Why doth our lord speak so, as
    though thy servants had committed so heinous a
    fact?</span></li>

    <li><span>The money, that we found in the top of our sacks, we
    brought back to thee from the land of Chanaan: how then should
    it be that we should steal out of thy lord's house, gold or
    silver?\</span></li>

    <li><span>With whomsoever of thy servants shall be found that
    which thou seekest, let him die, and we will be the bondmen of
    my lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to them: Let it be according to your
    sentence: with whomsoever it shall be found, let him be my
    servant, and you shall be blameless.</span></li>

    <li><span>Them they speedily took down their sacks to the
    ground, and every man opened his sack.</span></li>

    <li><span>Which when he had searched, beginning at the eldest
    and ending at the youngest, he found the cup in Benjamin's
    sack.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then they rent their garments, and loading their
    asses again, returned into the town.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Juda at the head of his brethren went in to
    Joseph, (for he was not yet gone out of the place, ) and they
    altogether fell down before him on the ground.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to them: Why would you do so? know you
    not that there is no one like me in the science of
    divining.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Juda said to him: What shall we answer my lord?
    or what shall we say, or be able justly to allege? God hath
    found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are all
    bondmen to my lord, both we, and he with whom the cup was
    found.</span></li>

    <li><span>Joseph answered: God forbid that should do so: he
    that stole the cup, he shall be my bondman: and go you away
    free to your father.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Juda coming hearer, said boldly: I beseech thee,
    my lord, let thy servant speak a word in thy ears,and be not
    angry with thy servant: for after Pharao thou art,</span></li>

    <li><span>My lord. Thou didst ask thy servants the first time:
    Have you a father or a brother?</span></li>

    <li><span>And we answered thee, my lord: We have a father an
    old man, and a young boy, that was born in his old age; whose
    brother by the mother is dead: and he alone is left of his
    mother, and his father loveth him tenderly.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou saidst to thy servants: Bring him hither to
    me, and I will set my eyes on him.</span></li>

    <li><span>We suggested to my lord: The boy cannot leave his
    father: for if he leave him, he will die.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou saidst to thy servants: Except your youngest
    brother come with you, you shall see my face no
    more.</span></li>

    <li><span>Therefore when we were gone up to thy servant our
    father, we told him all that my lord had said.</span></li>

    <li><span>And our father said: Go again, and buy us a little
    wheat.</span></li>

    <li><span>And we said to him: We cannot go: if our youngest
    brother go down with us, we will set out together: otherwise,
    without him we dare not see the man's face.</span></li>

    <li><span>Whereunto he answered: You know that my wife bore
    two.</span></li>

    <li><span>One went out, and you said: A beast devoured him: and
    hitherto he appeareth not.</span></li>

    <li><span>If you take this also, and any thing befall him in
    the way you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow unto
    hell.</span></li>

    <li><span>30Therefore if I shall go to thy servant our father,
    and the boy be wanting, (whereas his life dependeth upon the
    life of him,)</span></li>

    <li><span>And he shall see that he is not with us, he will die,
    and thy servants shall bring down his gray hairs with sorrow
    unto hell.</span></li>

    <li><span>Let me be tht proper servant, who took him into my
    trust, and promised, saying: If I bring him not again, I will
    be guilty of sin against my father for ever.</span></li>

    <li><span>Therefore I thy servant will stay instead of the boy
    in the service of my lord, and let the boy go up with his
    brethren.</span></li>

    <li><span>For I cannot return to my father without the boy,
    lest I be a witness of the calamity that will oppress my
    father.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="45">Genesis 45</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Joseph could no longer refrain himself before many
    that stood by: whereupon he commanded that all should go out,
    and no stranger be present at their knowing one
    another.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he lifted up his voice with weeping, which the
    Egyptians and all the house of Pharao heard. \</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to his brethren: I am Joseph: is my
    father yet living? His brethren could no answer him, being
    struck with exceeding great fear.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said mildly to them: Come nearer to me. And
    when they were come near him, he said: I am Joseph, your
    brother, whom you sold into Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>Be not afraid, and let it not seem to you a hard case
    that you sold me into these countries: for God sent me before
    you into Egypt for your preservation.</span></li>

    <li><span>For it is two years since the famine began to be upon
    the land, and five years more remain, wherein there can be
    neither ploughing nor reaping.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God sent me before, that you may be preserved
    upon the earth, and may have food to live.</span></li>

    <li><span>Not by your counsel was I sent hither, but by the
    will of God: who hath made me as it were a father to Pharao,
    and lord of his whold house, and governor in all the land of
    Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>Make haste, and go ye up to my father, and say to
    him: Thus saith thy son Joseph: God hath made me lord of the
    whole land of Egypt: come down to me, linger not.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt dwell in the land of Gessen: and thou
    shalt be near me, thou and thy sons, and thy son's sons, thy
    sheep, and thy gerds, and all things that thou
    hast.</span></li>

    <li><span>And there I will feed thee, (for there are yet five
    years of famine remaining,) lest both thou perish, and thy
    house, and all things that thou hast.</span></li>

    <li><span>Behold, your eyes, and the eyes of my brother
    Benjamin see that it is my mouth that speaketh to
    you.</span></li>

    <li><span>You shall tell my father of all my glory, and all
    things that you have seen in Egypt: make haste and bring him to
    me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And falling upon the neck of his brother Benjamin, he
    embraced him and wept: and Benjamin in like manner wept also on
    his neck.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Joseph kissed all his brethren, and wept upon
    every one of them: after which they were emboldened to ,peak to
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it was heard, and the fame was abroad in the
    king's court: The brethren of Joseph are come: and Pharao with
    all his family was glad.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he spoke to Joseph that he should give orders to
    his brethren, saying : Load your beasts, and go into the land
    of Chanaan.</span></li>

    <li><span>And bring away from thence your father and kindred,
    and come to me: and I will give you all the good things of
    Egypt, that you may eat the marrow of the land.</span></li>

    <li><span>Give orders also that they take wagons out of the
    land of Egypt, for/ the carriage of their children and their
    wives: and say: Take up your father, and make haste to come
    with all speed:</span></li>

    <li><span>And leave nothing of your house- hold stuff: for all
    the riches of Egypt shall be yours.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the sons of Israel did as they were bid. And
    Joseph gave them wagons according to Pharao's commandment: and
    provisions for the way.</span></li>

    <li><span>He ordered also to be brought out for every one of
    them two robes: but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of
    silver with Ave robes of the best:</span></li>

    <li><span>Sending to his father as much money and raiment,
    adding besides ten he asses to carry off all the riches of
    Egypt, and as many she asses, carrying wheat and bread for the
    journey.</span></li>

    <li><span>So he sent away his brethren, and at their departing
    said to them: Be not angry in the way.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land
    of Chanaan to their father Jacob.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they told him, saying: Joseph thy son is living:
    and he is ruler in all the land of Egypt. Which when Jacob
    heard, he awaked as it were out of a deep sleep, yet did not
    believe them.</span></li>

    <li><span>They, on the other side, told the whole order of the
    thing. And when he saw the wagons and all that he had sent his
    spirit revived,</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said: It is enough for me, if Joseph my son be
    yet living: Iwill go and see him before I die.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="46">Genesis 46</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And Israel taking his journey, with all that he had,
    came to the well of the oath, and killing victims there to the
    God of his father Isaac,</span></li>

    <li><span>He heard him by a vision in the night calling him,
    and saying to him: Jacob, Jacob. And he answered him: Lo, here
    I am.</span></li>

    <li><span>God said to him: I am the most mighty God of thy
    father: fear not, go down into Egypt, for I will make a great
    nation of thee there.</span></li>

    <li><span>I will go down with thee thither, and will bring thee
    back again from thence: Joseph also shall put his hands upon
    thy eyes.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jacob rose up from the well of the oath: and his
    sons took him up, with their children and wives in the wagons,
    which Pharao had sent to carry the old man,</span></li>

    <li><span>And all that he had in the land of Chanaan, and he
    came into Egypt with all his seed:"</span></li>

    <li><span>His sons, and grandsons, daughters, and all his
    offspring together.</span></li>

    <li><span>And these are the names of the children of Israel,
    that entered into Egypt, he and his children. His firstborn
    Ruben,</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Ruben: Henoch and Phallu, and Hesron and
    Charmi.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Simeon: Jamuel and Jamin and Ahod, and
    Jachin and Sohar, and Saul the son of a woman of
    Chanaan.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Levi: Gerson and Caath and
    Merari.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Juda: Her and Onan and Sela and Phares
    and Zara. And Her and Onan died in the land of Chanaan. And
    sons were born to Phares: Hesron and Hamul.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Issachar: Thola and Phua and Job and
    Semron.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Zabulon: Sared and Elo and
    Jahelel.</span></li>

    <li><span>These are the sons of Lia, whom she bore in
    Mesopotamia of Syria, with Dins his daughter. All the souls of
    her sons and daughters, thirty-three.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Cad: Sephian and Haggi and Suni and
    Esebon and Heri and Arodi and Areli.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Beer: Jamne and Jesua and Jessuri and
    Beria, and Sara their sister. The sons of Beria: Heber and
    Melchiel.</span></li>

    <li><span>These are the sons of Zelpha, whom Laban gave to Lia
    his daughter. And these she bore to Jacob, sixteen
    souls.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife: Joseph and
    Benjamin.</span></li>

    <li><span>And sons were born to Joseph, in the land of Egypt,
    whom Aseneth the daughter of Putiphare priest of Heliopolis
    bore him: Manasses and Ephraim.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Benjamin: Bela and Bechor and Asbel and
    Gera and Naaman and Echi and Ros and Mophim and Ophim and
    Ared.</span></li>

    <li><span>These are the sons of Rachel, whom she bore to Jacob:
    all the souls, four- teen.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Dan: Husim.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Nephtali: Jaziel and Guni and Jeser and
    Sallem.</span></li>

    <li><span>These are the sons of Bala, whom Laban gave to Rachel
    his daughter: and these she bore to Jacob: all the souls,
    seven.</span></li>

    <li><span>All the souls that went with Jacob into Egypt, and
    that came out of his thigh, besides his sons' wives,
    sixty-six.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the sons of Joseph, that were born to him in the
    land of Egypt, two souls. All the souls of the house of Jacob,
    that entered into Egypt, were seventy.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he sent Juda before him to Joseph, to tell him;
    and that he should meet him in Gessen.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he was come thither, Joseph made ready his
    chariot, and went up to meet his father, in the same place: and
    seeing him, he fell upon his neck, and embracing him
    wept.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the father said to Joseph: Now shall I die with
    joy, because I have seen thy face, and leave thee
    alive.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Joseph said to his brethren, and to all his
    father's house: I will go up, and will tell Pharao, and will
    say to him: My brethren and my father's house, that were in the
    land of Chanaan, are come to me:</span></li>

    <li><span>And the men are shepherds, and their occupation is to
    feed cattle: their flocks and herds, and all they have, they
    have brought with them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he shall call you, and shall say: What is
    your occupation?</span></li>

    <li><span>You shall answer: We thy servants are shepherds, from
    our infancy until now, both we and our fathers. And this you
    shall say, that you may dwell in the land of Gessen, because
    the Egyptians have all shepherds in abomination.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="47">Genesis 47</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Then Joseph went in and told Pharao, saying: My
    father and brethren, their sheep and their herds, and all that
    they possess, are come out of the land of Chanaan: and behold
    they stay in the land of Gessen.</span></li>

    <li><span>Five men also the last of his brethren, he presented
    before the king:</span></li>

    <li><span>And he asked them: What is your occupation? They
    answered: Re thy servants are shepherds, both we, and our
    fathers.</span></li>

    <li><span>We are come to sojourn in thy land, because there is
    no grass for the flocks of thy servants, the famine being very
    grievous in the land of Chanaan: and we pray thee to give
    orders that we thy servants may be in the land of
    Gessen.</span></li>

    <li><span>The king therefore said to Joseph: Thy father and thy
    brethren are come to thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>The land of Egypt is before thee: make them dwell in
    the best place, and give them the land of Gessen. And if thou
    knowest that there are industrious men among them, make them
    rulers over my cattle.</span></li>

    <li><span>After this Joseph brought in his to the king, and
    presented him before him: and he blessed him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And being asked by him: How many are the days of the
    years of thy life?</span></li>

    <li><span>He answered: The days of my pilgrimage are a hundred
    and thirty years, few, and evil, and they are not come up to
    the days of the pilgrimage of my fathers.</span></li>

    <li><span>And blessing the king, he went out.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Joseph gave a possession to his father and his
    brethren in Egypt, in the best place of the land, in Ramesses,
    as Pharao had commanded.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he nourished them, and all his father's house,
    allowing food to every one.</span></li>

    <li><span>For in the whole world there was want of bread, and a
    famine had op- pressed the land: more especially of Egypt and
    Chanaan.</span></li>

    <li><span>Out of which he gathered up all the money for the
    corn which they bought, and brought it into the king's
    treasure.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the buyers wanted money, all Egypt came to
    Joseph, saying: Give us bread: why should we die in thy
    presence, having now net money.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he answered them: Bring your cattle, and for them
    I will give you food, if you have no money.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they had brought them, he gave them food in
    exchange for their horses, and sheep, and oxen, end asses and
    he maintained them that year for the exchange of their
    cattle.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they came the second year, and said to him: We
    will not hide from our lord, how that our money is spent, and
    our cattle also are gone: neither art thou ignorant that we
    have nothing now left but our bodies and our lands.</span></li>

    <li><span>Why therefore shall we die before thy eyes? we will
    be thins, both we and our lands: buy us to be the king's
    servants, and give us seed, lest for want of tillers the land
    be turned into a wilderness.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt, every man
    selling his possessions, because of the greatness of the
    famine. And he brought it into Pharao's hands:</span></li>

    <li><span>And all its people from one end of the borders of
    Egypt, even to the other end thereof,</span></li>

    <li><span>Except the land of the priests, which had been given
    them by the king: to whom also a certain allowance of food was
    given out of the public stores, and therefore they were not
    forced to sell their possessions.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Joseph said to the people : Be- hold as you see,
    both you and your lands belong to Pharao: take seed and sow the
    fields,</span></li>

    <li><span>That you may have corn. The fifth part you shall give
    to the king: the other four you shall have for seed, and for
    food for your families and children.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they answered: Our life is in thy hand: only let
    my lord look favourably upon us, and we will gladly serve the
    king.</span></li>

    <li><span>From that time unto this day, in the whole land of
    Egypt, the fifth part is paid to the king, and it is become as
    a law, except the land of the priests, which was free from this
    covenant.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Israel dwelt in Egypt, that is, in the land of
    Gessen, and possessed it: and grew, and was multiplied
    exceedingly.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he lived in it seventeen years: and all the days
    of his life came to a hundred and forty-seven
    years.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he saw that the day of his death drew nigh,
    he called his son Joseph, and said to him: If I have found
    favour in thy sight, put thy hand under my thigh; and thou
    shalt shew me this kindness and truth, not to bury me in
    Egypt:</span></li>

    <li><span>But I will sleep with my fathers, end thou shalt take
    me away out of this land, and bury me in the burying place of
    my ancestors. And Joseph answered him: I will do what thou hast
    commanded.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said: Swear then to me. And as he was
    swearing, Israel adored God, turning to the bed's
    head.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="48">Genesis 48</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>After these things, it was told Joseph that his
    father was sick: and he set out to go to him, taking his two
    sons Manasses and Ephraim.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it was told the old man: Behold I thy son Joseph
    cometh to thee. And being strengthened he sat on his
    bed.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Joseph was come in to him, he said : God
    Almighty appeared to me at Lute, which is in the land of
    Chanaan: and he blessed me,</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said : I will cause thee to increase and
    multiply, and I will make of thee a multitude of people: and I
    will give this land to thee, and to thy seed after thee for an
    everlasting possession.</span></li>

    <li><span>So thy two sons who were born to thee in the land of
    Egypt before I came hither to thee, shall be mine: Ephraim and
    Manasses shall be reputed to me as Ruben and
    Simeon.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the rest whom thou shalt have after them, shall
    be thine, and shall be called by the name of their brethren in
    their possessions.</span></li>

    <li><span>For, when I came out of Mesopotamia, Rachel died from
    me in the land of Ohanaan in the very journey, and it was
    springtime: and I was going to Ephrata, and I buried her near
    the way of Ephrata, which by another name is called
    Bethlehem.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then seeing his sons, he said to him: Who are
    these?</span></li>

    <li><span>He answered: They are my sons, whom God hath given me
    in this place. And he said: Bring them to me that I may bless
    them.</span></li>

    <li><span>For Israel's eyes were dim by reason of his great
    age, and he could not see clearly. And when they were brought
    to him, he kissed and embraced them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And said to his son: I am not deprived of seeing
    thee: moreover God hath shewed me thy seed.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Joseph had taken them from his father's lap,
    he bowed down with his face to the ground.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he set Ephraim on his right bend, that is,
    towards the left hand of Israel; but Manasses on his left hand,
    to wit, towards his father's right hand, and brought them near
    to him.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he stretching forth his right hand, put it upon
    the head of Ephraim the younger brother; and the left upon the
    head of Manasses who was the elder, changing his
    hands.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jacob blessed the sons of Joseph, and said: God,
    in whose sight my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, God that
    feedeth me from my youth until this day;</span></li>

    <li><span>The angel that delivereth me from all evils, bless
    these boys: and let my name be called upon them, and the names
    of my fathers Abraham, and Isaac, and may they grow into a
    multitude upon the earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Joseph seeing that his father had put his right
    hand upon the head of Ephraim, was much displeased: and taking
    his father's hand he tried to lift it from Ephraims head, and
    to remove it to the head of Manasses.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to his father: It should not be so, my
    father: for this is the first- born, put thy right hand upon
    his head.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he refusing, said: I know, my son, I know: and
    this also shall become peoples, and shall be multiplied: but
    this younger brother shall be greater than he: and his seed
    shall grow into nations.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he blessed them at that time, saying: In thee
    shall Israel be blessed, and it shall be said: God do to thee
    as to Ephraim, and as to Manasses. And he set Ephraim before
    Manasses.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to Joseph his son: Be- hold I die, and
    God will be with you, and will bring you back into the land of
    your fathers.</span></li>

    <li><span>I give thee a portion above thy brethren, which I
    took out of the hand of the Amorrhite a with my sword and
    bow.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="49">Genesis 49</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And Jacob called his sons, and said to them: Gather
    yourselves together that I may tell you the things that shall
    befall you in the last days.</span></li>

    <li><span>Gather yourselves together, and hear, O ye sons of
    Jacob, hearken to Israel your father:</span></li>

    <li><span>Ruben, my firstborn, thou art my strength, and the
    beginning of my sorrow: excelling in gifts, greater in
    command.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou art poured out as water, grow thou not: because
    thou wentest up to thy father's bed, and didst defile his
    couch.</span></li>

    <li><span>Simeon and Levi brethren: vessels of iniquity, waging
    war.</span></li>

    <li><span>Let not my soul go into their counsel, nor my glory
    be in their assembly: "be- cause in their fury they slew a man,
    and in their selfwill they undermined a wall.</span></li>

    <li><span>Cursed be their fury, because it was stubborn: and
    their wrath because it was cruel: I Will divide them in Jacob,
    and will scatter them in Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>Juda, thee shall thy brethren praise: thy hands shall
    be on the necks of thy enemies: the sons of thy father shall
    bow down to thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>Juda is a lion's whelp: to the prey, my son, thou art
    gone up: resting thou hast couched as a lion, and as a lioness,
    who shall rouse him?</span></li>

    <li><span>The sceptre shall not be taken away from Juda, nor a
    ruler from his thigh, till he come that is to be sent, and he
    shall be the expectation of nations.</span></li>

    <li><span>11Tying his foal to the vineyard, and his ass, 0 my
    son, to the vine. He shall wash his robe in wine, and his
    garment in the blood of the grape.</span></li>

    <li><span>His eyes are more beautiful than wine, and his teeth
    whiter than milk.</span></li>

    <li><span>Zabulon shall dwell on the sea shore, and in the road
    of ships, reaching as far as Sidon.</span></li>

    <li><span>Issachar shall be a strong ass lying down between the
    borders.</span></li>

    <li><span>He saw rest that it was good: and the land that it
    was excellent: and he bowed his shoulder to carry, and became a
    servant under tribute.</span></li>

    <li><span>Dan shall judge his people like an- other tribe in
    Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>Let Dan be a snake in the way, a serpent in the path,
    that biteth the horse's heels that his rider may fall
    backward.</span></li>

    <li><span>I will look for thy salvation, 0 Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>Gad, being girded, shall fight before him: and he
    himself shall be girded backward.</span></li>

    <li><span>Aser, his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield
    dainties to kings.</span></li>

    <li><span>Nephtali, a hart let loose, and giving words of
    beauty.</span></li>

    <li><span>Joseph is a growing son, a growing son and comely to
    behold; the daughters run to and fro upon the wall.</span></li>

    <li><span>But they that held darts provoked him, and quarrelled
    with him, and envied him.</span></li>

    <li><span>His bow rested upon the strong, and the bands of his
    arms and his hands were loosed, by the hands of the mighty one
    of Jacob: thence he came forth a pastor, the stone of
    Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>The God of thy father shall be thy helper, and the
    Almighty shall bless thee with the blessings of heaven above,
    with the blessings of the deep that lieth be- neath, with the
    blessings of the breasts and of the womb.</span></li>

    <li><span>The blessings of thy father are strengthened with the
    blessings of his fathers: until the desire of the everlasting
    hills should come; may they be upon the head of Joseph, and
    upon the crown of the Nazarite among his brethren.</span></li>

    <li><span>Benjamin a ravenous wolf, in the morning shall eat
    the prey, and in the evening shall divide the
    spoil.</span></li>

    <li><span>All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: these
    things their father spoke to them, and he blessed every one,
    with their proper blessings.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he charged them, saying: I am now going to be
    gathered to my people : bury me with my fathers in the double
    cave, which is in the field of Ephron the Hethite,</span></li>

    <li><span>Over against Mambre in the land of Chanaan, which
    Abraham bought to- gather with the field of Ephron the Hethite
    for a possession to bury in.</span></li>

    <li><span>There they buried him, and Sara his wife: there was
    Isaac buried with Rebecca his wife: there also Lia doth lie
    buried.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had ended the commandments, wherewith he
    instructed his sons, he drew up his feet upon the bed, and
    died: and he was gathered to his people."</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="50">Genesis 50</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And when Joseph saw this, he fell upon his father's
    face weeping and kissing him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he commanded his servants the physicians to
    embalm his father.</span></li>

    <li><span>And while they were fulfilling his commands, there
    passed forty days: for this was the manner with bodies that
    were embalmed, and Egypt mounted for him seventy
    days.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the time of the mourning being expired, Joseph
    spoke to the family of Pharao: If I have found favour in your
    sight, speak in the ears of Pharao:</span></li>

    <li><span>For my father made me swear to him, saying: Behold I
    die: thou shalt bury me in my sepulchre which I have digged for
    myself in the land of Chanaan. So I will go up and bury my
    father, and return.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Pharao said to him: Go up and bury thy father
    according as he made thee swear.</span></li>

    <li><span>So he went up, and there went with him all the
    ancients of Pharao's house, and all the elders of the land of
    Egypt,</span></li>

    <li><span>And the house of Joseph with his brethren, except
    their children, and their flocks and herds, which they left in
    the land of Gessen.</span></li>

    <li><span>He had also in his train chariots and horsemen: and
    it was it great company.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is
    situated beyond the Jordan: where celebrating the exequies with
    a great and vehement lamentation, they spent full seven
    days.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the inhabitants of Chanaan saw this, they
    said: This is a great mourning to the Egyptians. And there-
    fore the name of that place was called, The mourning of
    Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>So the sons of Jacob did as he had commanded
    them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And carrying him into the land of Chanaan, they
    buried him in the double cave which Abraham had bought together
    with the held for a possession of a buryingplace, of Ephron the
    Hethite over against Mambre.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Joseph returned into Egypt with his brethren, and
    all that were in his company, after he had buried his
    father.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now he being dead, his brethren were afraid, and
    talked one with another : Lest perhaps he should remember the
    wrong he suffered, and requite us all the evil that we did to
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they sent a message to him, saying: Thy father
    commanded us before he died,</span></li>

    <li><span>That we should say thus much to thee from him: I
    beseech thee to forget the wickedness of thy brethren, and the
    sin and malice they practiced against thee: we also pray thee,
    to forgive the servants of the God of thy father this
    wickedness. And when Joseph heard this, he wept.</span></li>

    <li><span>And his brethren came to him: and worshipping
    prostrate on the ground they said: We are thy
    servants.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he answered them: Fear not: can we resist the
    will of God?</span></li>

    <li><span>You thought evil against me: but God turned it into
    good, that he might exalt me, as at present you see, and might
    save many people.</span></li>

    <li><span>Fear not: I will feed you and your children. And he
    comforted them, and spoke gently and mildly.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he dwelt in Egypt with all his father's house:
    and lived a hundred and ten years. And he saw the children of
    Ephraim to the third generation. The children also of Machir
    the son of Ma-nasses were born on Joseph's knees.</span></li>

    <li><span>After which he told his brethren: God will visit you
    after my death, and will make you go up out of this land, to
    the land which he swore to Abraham, Isaac, and
    Jacob.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he made them swear to him, saying: God will visit
    you, Carry my bones with you out of this place:</span></li>

    <li><span>And he died being a hundred and ten years old. And
    being embalmed he was laid in a coffin in Egypt.</span></li>
