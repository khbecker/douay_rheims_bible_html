<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="1">Jeremias 1</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>The words of Jeremias the son of Helcias, of the priests
that were in Anathoth, in the land of Benjamin.</span></li>
<li><span>The word of the Lord which came to him in the days of
Josias the son of Amon king of Juda, in the thirteenth year of his
reign.</span></li>
<li><span>And which came to him in the days of Joakim the son of
Josias king of Juda, unto the end of the eleventh year of Sedecias
the son of Josias king of Juda, even unto the carrying away of
Jerusalem captive, in the fifth month.</span></li>
<li><span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Before I formed thee in the bowels of thy mother, I knew
thee: and before thou camest forth out of the womb, I sanctified
thee, and made thee a prophet unto the nations.</span></li>
<li><span>And I said: Ah, ah, ah, Lord God: behold, I cannot speak,
for I am a child.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to me: Say not: I am a child: for thou
shalt go to all that I shall send thee: and whatsoever I shall
command thee, thou shalt speak.</span></li>
<li><span>Be not afraid at their presence: for I am with thee to
deliver thee, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord put forth his hand, and touched my mouth:
and the Lord said to me: Behold I have given my words in thy
mouth:</span></li>
<li><span>Lo, I have set thee this day over the nations, and over
the kingdoms, to root up, and pull down, and to waste, and to
destroy, and to build, and to plant.</span></li>
<li><span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: What seest
thou, Jeremias? And I said: I see a rod watching.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to me: Thou hast seen well: for I will
watch over my word to perform it.</span></li>
<li><span>And the word of the Lord came to me a second time,
saying: What seest thou? I see a boiling caldron, and the face
thereof from the face of the north.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to me: from the north shall an evil
break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.</span></li>
<li><span>For behold I will call together all the families of the
kingdoms of the north: saith the Lord: and they shall come, and
shall set every one his throne in the entrance of the gates of
Jerusalem, and upon all the walls thereof round about, and upon all
the cities of Juda,</span></li>
<li><span>And I will pronounce my judgements against them, touching
all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have sacrificed to
strange gods, and have adored the work of their own
hands.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak to
them all that I command thee. Be not afraid at their presence : for
I will make thee not to fear their countenance.</span></li>
<li><span>For behold I have made thee this day a fortified city,
and a pillar of iron, and a wall of brass, over all the land, to
the kings of Juda, to the princes thereof, and to the priests, and
to the people of the land.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall fight against thee, and shall not prevail:
for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="2">Jeremias 2</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying: Thus saith
the Lord: I have remembered thee, pitying thy soul, pitying thy
youth, and the love of thy espousals, when thou followedst me in
the desert, in a land that is not sown.</span></li>
<li><span>Israel is holy to the Lord, the first fruits of his
increase: all they that devour him offend: evils shall come upon
them, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Hear ye the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob, and all
ye families of the house of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: What iniquity have your fathers
found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after
vanity, and are become vain?</span></li>
<li><span>And they have not said: Where is the Lord, that made us
come up out of the land of Egypt? that led us through the desert,
through a land uninhabited and unpassable, through a land of
drought, and the image of death, through a land wherein no man
walked, nor any man dwelt?</span></li>
<li><span>And I brought you into the land of Carmel, to eat the
fruit thereof, and the best things thereof: ad when ye entered in,
you defiled my land, and made my inheritance an
abomination.</span></li>
<li><span>The priests did not say: Where is the Lord? and they that
held the law knew me not, and the pastors transgressed against me:
and the prophets prophesied in Baal, and followed
idols.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore will I yet contend in judgement with you, saith
the Lord, and I will plead with your children.</span></li>
<li><span>Pass over to the isles of Cethim, and see: and send into
Cedar, and consider diligently: and see if there hath been done any
thing like this.</span></li>
<li><span>If a nation hath changed their gods, and indeed they are
not gods,: but my people have changed their glory into an
idol.</span></li>
<li><span>Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and ye gates
thereof, be very desolate, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>For my people have done two evils. They have forsaken me,
the fountain of living water, and have digged to themselves
cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.</span></li>
<li><span>Is Israel a bondman, or a homeborn slave? why then is he
become prey?</span></li>
<li><span>The lions have roared upon him, and have made a noise,
they have made his land a wilderness: his cities are burnt down and
there is none to dwell in them.</span></li>
<li><span>The children also of Memphis, and of Taphnes have
deflowered thee, even to the crown of the head.</span></li>
<li><span>Hath not this been done to thee, because thou hast
forsaken the Lord thy God at that time, when he led thee by the
way?</span></li>
<li><span>And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to
drink the troubled water? And what hast thou to do with the way of
the Assyrians, to drink the water of the river?</span></li>
<li><span>Thy own wickedness shall reprove thee, and thy apostasy
shall rebuke thee. Know thou, and see that it is an evil and a
bitter thing for thee, to have left the Lord thy God, and that my
fear is not with thee, saith the Lord the God of hosts.</span></li>
<li><span>Of old time thou hast broken my yoke, thou hast burst my
bands, and thou saidst: I will not serve. For on every high hill,
and under every green tree thou didst prostitute
thyself.</span></li>
<li><span>Yet I planted thee a chosen vineyard, all true seed: how
then art thou turned unto me into that which is good for nothing, O
strange vineyard?</span></li>
<li><span>Though thou wash thyself with nitre, and multiply to
thyself the herb borith, thou art stained in thy iniquity before
me, saith the Lord God.</span></li>
<li><span>How canst thou say: I am not polluted, and I have not
walked after Baalim? see thy ways in the valley, know what thou
hast done: as a swift runner pursuing his course.</span></li>
<li><span>A wild ass accustomed to the wilderness in the desire of
his heart, snuffed up the wind of his love: none shall turn her
away: all that seek her shall not fail: in her monthly filth they
shall find her.</span></li>
<li><span>Keep thy foot from being bare, and thy throat from
thirst. But thou saidst: I have lost all hope, I will not do it:
for I have loved strangers, and I will walk after them.</span></li>
<li><span>As the thief is confounded when he is taken, so is the
house of Israel confounded, they and their kings, their princes and
their priests, and their prophets.</span></li>
<li><span>Saying to a stock: Thou art my father: and to a stone:
thou hast begotten me: they have turned their back to me, and not
their face: and in the time of their affliction they will say:
Arise, and deliver us.</span></li>
<li><span>Where are the gods, whom thou hast made thee? let them
arise and deliver thee in the time of thy affliction: for according
to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>Why will you contend with me in judgement? you have all
forsaken me, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>In vain have I struck your children, they have not
received correction: your sword hath devoured your prophets, your
generation is like a ravaging lion.</span></li>
<li><span>See ye the word of the Lord: Am I become a wilderness to
Israel, or a lateward springing land? why then have my people said:
We are revolted, we will come to thee no more.</span></li>
<li><span>Will a virgin forget her ornament, or a bride her
stomacher? but my people hath forgotten me days without
number.</span></li>
<li><span>Why dost thou endeavor to shew thy way good to seek my
love, thou who has also taught thy malices to be thy
ways,</span></li>
<li><span>And in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the
poor and innocent? not in ditches have I found them, but in all
places, which I mentioned before.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou hast said: I am without sin and am innocent: and
therefore let thy anger be turned away from me. Behold, I will
contend with thee in judgement, because thou hast said: I have not
sinned.</span></li>
<li><span>How exceeding base art thou become, going the same ways
over again! and thou shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast
ashamed of Assyria.</span></li>
<li><span>For from thence thou shalt go, and thy hand shall be upon
thy head: for the Lord hath destroyed thy trust, and thou shalt
have nothing prosperous therein.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="3">Jeremias 3</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>It is commonly said: If a man put away his wife, and she
go from him, and marry another man, shall he return to her any
more? shall not that woman be polluted, and defiled? but thou hast
prostituted thyself to many lovers: nevertheless return to me,
saith the Lord, and I will receive thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Lift up thy eyes on high: and see where thou hast not
prostuted thyself: Thou didst sit in the ways, waiting for them as
a robber in the wilderness: and thou hast polluted the land with
thy fornications, and with thy wickedness.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore the showers were withholden, and there was no
lateward rain: thou hadst a harlot's forehead, thou wouldst not
blush.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore at least at this time call to me: Thou art my
father, the guide of my virginity:</span></li>
<li><span>Wilt thou be angry for ever, or wilt thou continue until
the end? Behold, thou hast spoken, and hast done evil things, and
hast been able.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to me in the days of king Josias: Hast
thou seen what rebellious Israel hast done? she hath gone out of
herself upon every high mountain, and under every green tree, and
hath played the harlot there.</span></li>
<li><span>And when she had done all these things, I said: Return to
me, and she did not return. And her treacherous sister Juda
saw,</span></li>
<li><span>That because the rebellious Israel had played the harlot,
I had put her away, and had given her a bill of divorce: yet her
treacherous sister Juda was not afraid, but went and played the
harlot also herself.</span></li>
<li><span>And by the facility of her fornication she defiled the
land, and played the harlot with stones and with
stocks.</span></li>
<li><span>And after all this, her treacherous sister Juda hath not
returned to me with her whole heart, but with falsehood, saith the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to me: The rebellious Israel hath
justified her soul, in comparison of the treacherous
Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and thou
shalt say: Return, O rebellious Israel, saith the Lord, and I will
not turn away my face from you: for I am holy, saith the Lord, and
I will not be angry for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>But yet acknowledge thy iniquity, that thou hast
transgressed against the Lord thy God: and thou hast scattered thy
ways to strangers under every green tree, and hast not heard my
voice, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Return, O ye revolting children, saith the Lord: for I am
your husband: and I will take you, one of a city, and two of a
kindred, and will bring you into Sion.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will give you pastors according to my own heart,
and they shall feed you with knowledge and doctrine.</span></li>
<li><span>And when you shall be multiplied, and increase in the
land in those days, saith the Lord, they shall say no more: The ark
of the covenant of the Lord: neither shall it come upon the heart,
neither shall they remember it, neither shall it be visited,
neither shall that be done any more.</span></li>
<li><span>At that time Jerusalem shall be called the thrown of the
Lord: and all the nations shall be gathered together to it, in the
name of the Lord to Jerusalem, and they shall not walk after the
perversity of their most wicked heart.</span></li>
<li><span>In those days the house of Juda shall go to the house of
Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north
to the land which I gave to your fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>But I said: How shall I put thee among the children, and
give thee a lovely land, the goodly inheritance of the armies of
the Gentiles? And I said: Thou shalt call me father and shalt cease
to walk after me.</span></li>
<li><span>But as a woman that despiseth her lover, so hath the
house of Israel despised me, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>A voice was heard in the highways, weeping and howling of
the children of Israel: because they have made their way wicked,
they have forgotten the Lord their God.</span></li>
<li><span>Return, you rebellious children, and I will heal your
rebellions. Behold we come to thee: for thou art the Lord our
God.</span></li>
<li><span>In very deed the hills were liars. and the multitude of
the mountains: truly in the Lord our God is the salvation of
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Confusion hath devoured the labor of our fathers from our
youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their
daughters.</span></li>
<li><span>We shall sleep in our confusion, and our shame shall
cover us, because we have sinned against the Lord our God, we and
our fathers from our youth even to this day, and we have not
hearkened to the voice of theLord our God.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="4">Jeremias 4</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the Lord, return to
me: if thou wilt take away thy stumblingblocks out of my sight,
thou shalt not be moved.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt swear: As the Lord liveth, in truth, and
in judgement, and in justice: and the Gentiles shall bless him, and
shall praise him.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord to the men of Juda and Jerusalem:
Break up anew your fallow ground, and sow not upon
thorns:</span></li>
<li><span>Be circumcised to the Lord, and take away the foreskins
of your hearts, ye men of Juda, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem:
lest my indignation come forth like fire, and burn, and there be
none that can quench it: because of the wickedness of your
thoughts.</span></li>
<li><span>Declare ye in Juda, and make it heard in Jerusalem:
speak, and sound with the trumpet in the land: cry aloud, and say:
Assemble yourselves, and let us go into strong cities.</span></li>
<li><span>Set up the standard in Sion. Strengthen yourselves, stay
not: for I bring evil from the north, and great
destruction.</span></li>
<li><span>The lion is come up out of his den, and the robber of
nations hath roused himself: he is come forth out of his place, to
make thy land desolate: thy cities shall be laid waste, remaining
without an inhabitant.</span></li>
<li><span>For this gird yourselves with haircloth, lament and howl:
for the fierce anger of the Lord is not turned away from
us.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord:
That the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the
princes: and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets
shall be amazed</span></li>
<li><span>And I said: Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God, hast thou then
deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying: You shall have peace:
and behold the sword reacheth even to the soul?</span></li>
<li><span>At that time it shall be said to this people, and to
Jerusalem: A burning wind is in the ways that are in the desert of
the way of the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to
cleanse.</span></li>
<li><span>A full wind from these places shall come to me: and now I
will speak my judgments with them.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold he shall come up as a cloud, and his chariots as a
tempest: his horses are swifter than eagles: woe unto us, for we
are laid waste.</span></li>
<li><span>Wash thy heart from wickedness, O Jerusalem, that thou
mayst be saved: how long shall hurtful thoughts abide in
thee?</span></li>
<li><span>For a voice of one declaring from Dan, and giving notice
of the idol from mount Ephraim.</span></li>
<li><span>Say ye to the nations: Behold it is heard in Jerusalem,
that guards are coming from a far country, and give out their voice
against the cities of Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>They are set round about her, as keepers of fields:
because she hath provoked me to wrath, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>They ways, and thy devices have brought these things upon
thee: this is thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it hath
touched thy heart.</span></li>
<li><span>My bowels, my bowels are in pain, the senses of my heart
are troubled within me, I will not hold my peace, for my soul hath
heard the sound of the trumpet, the cry of battle.</span></li>
<li><span>Destruction upon destruction is called for, and all the
earth is laid waste: my tents are destroyed on a sudden, and my
pavilions in a moment.</span></li>
<li><span>How long shall I see men fleeing away, how long shall I
hear the sound of the trumpet?</span></li>
<li><span>For my foolish people have not known me: they are foolish
and senseless children: they are wise to do evil, but to do good
they have no knowledge.</span></li>
<li><span>I beheld the earth, and lo it was void, and nothing: and
the heavens, and there was no light in them.</span></li>
<li><span>I looked upon the mountains, and behold they trembled:
and all the hills were troubled.</span></li>
<li><span>I beheld, and lo there was no man: and all the birds of
the air were gone.</span></li>
<li><span>I looked, and behold Carmel was a wilderness: and all its
cities were destroyed at the presence of the Lord, and at the
presence of the wrath of his indignation.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord: All the land shall be desolate,
but yet I will not utterly destroy.</span></li>
<li><span>The earth shall mourn, and the heavens shall lament from
above: because I have spoken, I have purposed, and I have not
repented, neither am I turned away from it.</span></li>
<li><span>At the voice of the horsemen, and the archers, all the
city is fled away; they have entered into thickets and have climbed
up the rocks: all the cities are forsaken, and there dwelleth not a
man in them.</span></li>
<li><span>But when thou art spoiled what wilt thou do? though thou
deckest thee with ornaments of gold, and paintest thy eyes with
stibic stone, thou shalt dress thyself out in vain: thy lovers have
despised thee, they will seek thy life.</span></li>
<li><span>For I have heard the voice as of a woman in travail,
anguishes as of a woman in labor of a child. The voice of the
daughter of Sion, dying away, spreading her hands: Woe is me, for
my soul hath fainted because of them that are slain.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="5">Jeremias 5</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Go about through the streets of Jerusalem, and see, and
consider, and seek in the broad places thereof, if you can fins a
man that executeth judgement, and seeketh faith: and I will be
merciful unto it.</span></li>
<li><span>And though they say: The Lord liveth; this also they will
swear falsely.</span></li>
<li><span>O Lord, thy eyes are upon truth: thou hast struck them,
and they have not grieved: thou hast bruised them, and they have
refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder
than the rock, and they have refused to return.</span></li>
<li><span>But I said: Perhaps these are poor and foolish, that know
not the way of the Lord, the judgement of their God.</span></li>
<li><span>I will go therefore to the great men, and I will speak to
them: for they known the way of the Lord, the judgement of their
God: and behold these have together broken the yoke more, and have
burst the bonds.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore a lion out of the wood hath slain them, a wolf
in the evening, hath spoiled them, a leopard watcheth for their
cities: every one that shall go out thence shall be taken, because
their transgressions are multiplied, their rebellions are
strengthened.</span></li>
<li><span>How can I be merciful to thee? thy children have forsaken
me, and swear by them that are not gods: I fed them to the full,
and they committed adultery, and rioted in the harlot's
house.</span></li>
<li><span>They are become as amorous horses and stallions, every
one neighed after his neighbor's wife.</span></li>
<li><span>Shall I not visit for these things, sayeth the Lord? and
shall not my soul take revenge on such a nation?</span></li>
<li><span>Scale down the walls thereof, and throw them down, but do
not utterly destroy: take away the branches thereof, because they
are not the Lord's.</span></li>
<li><span>For the house of Israel, and the house of Juda have
greatly transgressed against me, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>They have denied the Lord, and said, It is not he: and
the evil shall not come upon us: we shall not see the sword and
famine.</span></li>
<li><span>The prophets have spoken in the wind, and there was no
word of God in them: these things therefore shall befall
them.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord the God of hosts: Because you have
spoken this word, behold I will make my words in thy mouth as fire,
and this people as wood, and it shall devour them.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I will bring upon you a nation from afar, O house
of Israel, saith the Lord: a strong nation, an ancient nation, a
nation whose language thou shalt not know, nor understand what they
say.</span></li>
<li><span>Their quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all
valiant.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall eat up thy corn, and thy bread: they shall
devour thy sons, and thy daughters: they shall eat up thy flocks,
and thy herds: they shall eat thy vineyards, and thy figs: and with
the sword they shall destroy thy strong cities, wherein thou
trustest.</span></li>
<li><span>Nevertheless in those days, saith the Lord, I will not
bring you to utter destruction.</span></li>
<li><span>And if you shall say: why hath the Lord our God done all
these things to us? thou shalt say to them: As you have forsaken
me, and served a strange god in your own land, so shall you serve
strangers in a land that is not your own.</span></li>
<li><span>Declare ye this to the house of Jacob, and publish it in
Juda, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Hear, O foolish people, and without understanding: who
have eyes, and see not: and ears, and hear not.</span></li>
<li><span>Will not you then fear me, saith the Lord: and will you
not repent at my presence? I have set the sand a bound for the sea,
an everlasting ordinance, which it shall not pass over: and the
waves thereof shall toss themselves, and shall not prevail: they
shall swell, and shall not pass over it.</span></li>
<li><span>But the heart of this people is become hard of belief and
provoking, they are revolted and gone away.</span></li>
<li><span>And they have not said in their heart: let us fear the
Lord our God, who giveth us the early and the latter rain in due
season: who preserveth for us the fullness of the yearly
harvest.</span></li>
<li><span>Your iniquities have turned these things away, and your
sins have withholden good things from you.</span></li>
<li><span>For among my people are found wicked men, that lie in
wait as fowlers, setting snares and traps to catch men.</span></li>
<li><span>As a net is full of birds, so their houses are full of
deceit: therefore are they become great and enriched.</span></li>
<li><span>They are grown gross and fat: andhave most wickedly
transgressed my words. They have not judged the cause of the widow,
they have not managed the cause of the fatherless, they have not
judged the judgement of the poor.</span></li>
<li><span>Shall I not visit for these things, saith the Lord? or
shall not my soul take revenge on such a nation?</span></li>
<li><span>Astonishing and wonderful things have been done in the
land.</span></li>
<li><span>The prophets prophesied falsehood, and the priests
clapped their hands: and my people loved such things: what then
shall be done in the end thereof?</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>Strengthen yourselves, ye sons of Benjamin, in the midst
of Jerusalem, and sound the trumpet in Thecua, and set up the
standard over Bethacarem: for evil is seen out of the north, and a
great destruction.</span></li>
<li><span>I have likened the daughter of Sion to a beautiful and
delicate woman.</span></li>
<li><span>The shepherds shall come to her with their flocks: they
have pitched their tents against her round about: every one shall
feed them that are under his hand.</span></li>
<li><span>Prepare ye war against her: arise, and let us go up at
midday: woe unto us, for the day is declined, for the shadows of
the evening are grown longer.</span></li>
<li><span>Arise, and let us go up in the night, and destroy her
houses.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord of hosts: Hew down her trees,
cast up a trench about Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited,
all oppression is in the midst of her.</span></li>
<li><span>As a cistern maketh its water cold, so hath she made her
wickedness cold: violence and spoil shall be heard in her,
infirmity and stripes are continually before me.</span></li>
<li><span>Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from
thee, lest I make thee desolate, a land uninhabited.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: They shall gather the
remains of Israel, as in a vine, even to one cluster: turn back thy
hand, as a grape gatherer into the basket.</span></li>
<li><span>To whom shall I speak? and to whom shall I testify, that
he may hear? behold, their ears are uncircumcised, and they cannot
hear: behold the word of the Lord is become unto them a reproach:
and and they will not receive it.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore am I full of the fury of the Lord, I am weary
with holding in: pour it out upon the child abroad, and upon the
council of the young men together: for man and woman shall be
taken, the ancient and he that is full of days.</span></li>
<li><span>And their houses shall be turned over to others, with
their lands and their wives together: for I will stretch for my
hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>For from the least of them even to the greatest, all are
given to covetousness: and from the prophet even to the priest, all
are guilty of deceit.</span></li>
<li><span>And they healed the breach of the daughter of my people
disgracefully, saying: Peace, peace: and there was no
peace.</span></li>
<li><span>They were confounded, because they commmitted
abomination: yea, rather they were not confounded with confusion,
and they knew not how to blush: wherefore they shall fall among
them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall fall
down, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: Stand ye on the ways, and see and
ask for the old paths which is the good way, and walk ye in it: and
you shall find refreshment for your souls. And they said: we will
not walk.</span></li>
<li><span>And I appointed watchmen over you, saying: Hearken ye to
the sound of the trumpet. And they said: We will not
hearken.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation,
what great things I will do to them.</span></li>
<li><span>Hear, O earth: Behold I will bring evils upon this
people, the fruits of their own thoughts: because they have not
heard my words, and they have cast away my law.</span></li>
<li><span>To what purpose do you bring me frankincense from Saba,
and the sweet smelling cane from a far country? your holocausts are
not acceptable, nor are your sacrifices pleasing to me.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord: Behold, I will bring
destruction upon this people, by which fathers and sons together
shall fall, neighbor and kinsman shall perish.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: Behold a people cometh from the land
of the north, and a great nation shall rise up from the ends of the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>They shall lay hold on arrow and shield: they are cruel,
and will have no mercy. Their voice shall roar like the sea: and
they shall mount upon horses, prepared as men for war, against
thee, O daughter of Sion.</span></li>
<li><span>We have heard the fame thereof, our hands grow feeble:
anguish hath taken hold of us, as a woman in labor.</span></li>
<li><span>Go not out into the fields, nor walk in the highway: for
the sword of the enemy, and fear is on every side.</span></li>
<li><span>Gird thee with sackcloth, O daughter of my people, and
sprinkle thee with ashes: make thee mourning as for an only son, a
bitter lamentation, because the destroyer shall suddenly come upon
us.</span></li>
<li><span>I have set thee for a strong trier among my people: and
thou shalt know and prove their way.</span></li>
<li><span>All of these princes go out of the way, they walk
deceitfully, they are brass and iron: they are all
corrupted.</span></li>
<li><span>The bellows have failed, the lead is consumed in the
fire, the founder hath melted in vain: for their wicked deeds are
not consumed.</span></li>

them.</span></li>

<li><span>The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Stand in the gate of the house of the Lord, and proclaim
there this word, and say: Hear ye the word of the Lord, all ye men
of Juda, that enter in at these gates, to adore the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Make your
ways and your doings good: and I will dwell with you in this
place.</span></li>
<li><span>Trust not in lying words, saying: The temple of the Lord,
the temple of the Lord, it is the temple of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>For if you will order well your ways, and your doings: if
you will execute judgement between a man and his
neighbor,</span></li>
<li><span>If you opress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the
widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, and walk not
after strange gods to your own hurt,</span></li>
<li><span>I will dwell with you in this place: in the land, which I
gave to your fathers from the beginning and for
evermore.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold you put your trust in lying words, which shall not
profit you:</span></li>
<li><span>To steal, to murder, to commit adultery, to swear
falsely, to offer to Baalim, and to go after strange gods, which
you know not.</span></li>
<li><span>And you have come, and stood before me in this house, in
which my name is called upon, and have said: We are delivered,
because we have done all these abominations.</span></li>
<li><span>Is this house then, in which my name hath been called
upon, in your eyes become a den of robbers? I, I am he: I have seen
it, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Go ye to my place in Silo, where my name dwelt from the
beginning: and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people
Israel:</span></li>
<li><span>And now, because you have done all these works, saith the
Lord: and I have spoken to you rising up early, and speaking, and
you have not heard: and I have called you, and you have not
answered:</span></li>
<li><span>I will do to this house, in which my name is called upon,
and in which you trust, and to the places which I have given you
and your fathers, as I did to Silo.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will cast you away from before my face, as I have
cast away all your brethren, the whole seed of Ephraim.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore, do not thou pray for this people, nor take to
thee praise and supplication for them: and do not withstand me: for
I will not hear thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Juda, and in
the streets of Jerusalem?</span></li>
<li><span>The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire
and the women knead the dough, to make cakes to the queen of
heaven, and to offer libations to strange gods, and to provoke me
to anger.</span></li>
<li><span>Do they provoke me to anger, saith the Lord? Is it not
themselves, to the confusion of their contenance?</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Behold my wrath and my
indignation was enkindled against this place, upon men and upon
beasts, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruits of the
land, and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Add your
burnt offerings to your sacrifices, and eat ye the
flesh.</span></li>
<li><span>For I spoke not to your fathers, and I commanded them
not, in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt,
concerning the matter of burnt offerings and
sacrifices.</span></li>
<li><span>But this thing I commanded them, saying: Hearken to my
voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people: and walk
ye in all the way that I have commanded you, that it may be well
with you.</span></li>
<li><span>But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear: but
walked in their own will, and in the perversity of their wicked
heart: and went backward and not forward,</span></li>
<li><span>From the day that their fathers came out of the land of
Egypt, even to this day. And I have sent to you all my servants the
prophets from day to day, rising up early and sending.</span></li>
<li><span>And they have not hearkened to me: nor inclined their
ear: but have hardened their neck, and have done worse than their
fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt speak to them all these words, but they
will not hearken to thee: and thou shalt call them, but they will
not answer thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt say to them: This is a nation which hath
not hearkened to the voice of the Lord their God, nor received
instruction: Faith is lost, and is carried away out of their
mouth.</span></li>
<li><span>Cut off thy hair, and cast it away: and take up a
lamentation on high: for the Lord hath rejected and forsaken the
generation of his wrath,</span></li>
<li><span>Because the children of Juda have done evil in my eyes,
saith the Lord. They have set their abominations in the house in
which my name is called upon, to pollute it;</span></li>
<li><span>And they have built the high places of Topeth, which is
in the valley of the son of Ennom, to burn their sons, and their
daughters in the fire: which I commanded not, nor thought on in my
heart.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore behold the days shall come, saith the Lord, and
it shall no more be called Topeth, nor the valley of the son of
Ennom: but the valley of slaughter, and they shall bury in Topeth,
because there is no place.</span></li>
<li><span>And the carcasses of this people shall be meat for the
fowls of the air, and for the beasts of the earth, and there shall
be non to drive them away.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will cause ot cease out of the cities of Juda, and
out of the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of joy, and the coice of
gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride:
for the land shall be desolate.</span></li>

<li><span>At that time, saith the Lord, they shall cast out the
bones of the kings of Juda, and the bones of the princes thereof,
and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, out of their graves.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall spread them abroad to the sun, and the
moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom
they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they
have sought, and adored: they shall not be gathered, and they shall
not be buried: they shall be as dung upon the face of the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And death shall be chosen rather than life by all that
shall remain of this wicked kindred in all places, which are left,
to which I have cast them out, saith the Lord of hosts.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord: Shall
not he that falleth, rise again? and he that is turned away, shall
he not turn again?</span></li>
<li><span>Why then is this people in Jerusalem turned away with a
stubborn revolting? they have laid hold on lying, and have refused
to return.</span></li>
<li><span>I attended, and hearkened; no man speaketh what is good,
there is none that doth penance for his sin, saying: What have I
done? They are all turned to their own course, as a horse rushing
to the battle.</span></li>
<li><span>The kite in the air hath known her time: the turtle, and
the swallow, and the stork have observed the time of their coming:
but my people have not known the judgment of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>How do you say: We are wise, and the law of the Lord is
with us? Indeed the lying pen of the scribes hath wrought
falsehood.</span></li>
<li><span>The wise men are confounded, they are dismayed, and
taken: for they have cast away the word of the Lord, and there is
no wisdom in them.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore I will give their women to strangers, their
fields to others for an inheritance: because from the least even to
the greatest all follow covetousness: from the prophet even to the
priest, all deal deceitfully.</span></li>
<li><span>And they healed the breach of the daughter of my people
disgracefully, saying Peace, peace: when there was no
peace.</span></li>
<li><span>They are confounded, because they have committed
abomination: yea rather they are not confounded with confusion, and
they have not know how to blush: therefore shall they fall among
them that fall; in the time of their visitation they shall fall,
saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Gathering I will gather them together, saith the Lord,
there is no grape on the vines, and there are no figs on the fig
tree, the leaf is fallen: and I have given them the things that are
passed away.</span></li>
<li><span>Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us
enter into the fenced city, and let us be silent there: for the
Lord our God hath put us to silence, and hath given us water of
gall to drink: for we have sinned against the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>We looked for peace and no good came: for a time of
healing, and behold fear.</span></li>
<li><span>The snorting of his horse was heard from Dan, all the
land was moved at the sound of the neighing of his warriors: and
they came and devoured the land, and all that was in it: the city
and its inhabitants.</span></li>
<li><span>For behold I will send among you serpents, basilisks,
against which there is no charm: and they shall bite you, saith the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>My sorrow is above sorrow, my heart mourneth within
me.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold the voice of the daughter my people from a far
country: Is not the Lord in Sion, or is not her king in her? why
then have they provoked me to wrath with their idols, and strange
vanities?</span></li>
<li><span>The harvest is passed, the summer is ended, and we are
not saved.</span></li>
<li><span>For the affliction of the daughter of my people I am
afflicted, and made sorrowful, astonishment hath taken hold on

daughter of my people.</span></li>
<li><span>Who will give me in the wilderness a lodging place of
wayfaring men, and I will leave my people, and depart from them?
because they are all adulterers, an assembly of
transgressors.</span></li>
<li><span>And they have bent their tongue, as a bow, for lies, and
not for truth: they have strengthened themselves upon the earth,
for they have proceeded from evil to evil, and me they have not

<li><span>Let every man take heed of his neighbor, and let his not
trust in any brother of his: for every brother will utterly
supplant, and every friend will walk deceitfully.</span></li>
<li><span>And a man shall mock his brother, and they will not speak

<li><span>For the mountains I will take up weeping and lamentation,
and for the beautiful places of the desert, mourning: because they
are burnt up, for that there is not a man that passeth through
them: and they have not heard the voice of the owner: from the fowl
of the air to the beasts they are gone away and
departed.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will make Jerusalem to be heaps of sand, and dens
of dragons: and I will make the cities of Juda desolate, for want
of an inhabitant.</span></li>
<li><span>Who is the wise man, that may understand this, and to
whom the word of the mouth of the Lord may come that he may declare
this, why the land hath perished, and is burnt up like a
wilderness, which none passeth through?</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said: Because they have forsaken my law,
which I gave them, and have not heard my voice, and have not walked
in it.</span></li>
<li><span>But they have gone after the perverseness of their own
heart, and after Baalim, which their fathers taught
them.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel:
Behold I will feed this people with wormwood, and give them water
of gall to drink.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will scatter them among the nations, which they and
their fathers have not known: and I will send the sword after them
till they be consumed.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Consider
ye, and call for the mourning women, and let them come: and send to
them that are wise women, and let them make haste:</span></li>
<li><span>Let them hasten and take up a lamentation for us: let our
eyes shed tears, and our eyelids run down with waters.</span></li>
<li><span>For a voice of wailing is heard out of Sion: How are we
wasted and greatly confounded? because we have left the land,
because our dwellings are cast down.</span></li>
<li><span>Hear therefore, ye women, the word of the Lord: and let
your ears receive the word of his mouth: and teach your daughters
wailing: and every one her neighbor mourning.</span></li>
<li><span>For death is come up through our windows, it is entered
into our houses to destroy the children from without, the young men
from the streets.</span></li>
<li><span>Speak: Thus saith the Lord: Even the carcass of man shall
fall as dung upon the face of the country, and as grass behind the
back of the mower, and there is none to gather it.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: Let not the wise man glory in his
wisdom, and let not the strong man glory in his strength, and let
not the rich man glory in his riches:</span></li>
<li><span>But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he
understandeth and knoweth me, for I am the Lord that exercise
mercy, and judgment, and justice in the earth: for these things
please me, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, and I will visit
upon every one that hath the foreskin circumcised.</span></li>
<li><span>Upon Egypt, and upon Juda, and upon Edom, and upon the
children of Ammon, and upon Moab, and upon all that have their hair

<li><span>For the laws of the people are vain: for the works of the
hand of the workman hath cut a tree out of the forest with an
axe.</span></li>
<li><span>He hath decked it with silver and gold: he hath put it
together with nails and hammers, that it may not fall
asunder.</span></li>
<li><span>They are framed after the likeness of a palm tree, and
shall not speak: they must be carried to be removed, because they
cannot go. Therefore, fear them not, for they can neither do evil
nor good.</span></li>
<li><span>There is none like to thee, O Lord: thou art great and
great is thy name in might.</span></li>
<li><span>Who shall fear thee, O king of nations? for thine is the
glory: among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their
kingdoms there is none like unto thee.</span></li>
<li><span>They shall all proved together to be senseless and
foolish: the doctrine of their vanity is wood.</span></li>
<li><span>Silver spread into plates is brought from Tharsis, and
gold from Ophaz: the work of the artificer, and of the hand of the
coppersmith: violet and purple is their clothing: all these things
are the work of artificers.</span></li>
<li><span>But the Lord is the true God: he is the living God, and
the everlasting king, at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the
nations shall not be able to abide his threatening.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus then shall you say to them: The gods that have not
made heaven and earth, let them perish from the earth, and from
among those places that are under heaven.</span></li>
<li><span>He that maketh the earth by his power, that prepareth the
world by his wisdom, and stretcheth out the heavens by his
knowledge.</span></li>
<li><span>At his voice he giveth a multitude of waters in the
heaven, and lifteth up the clouds from the ends of the earth: he
maketh lightnings for rain, and bringeth for the wind out of his
treasures.</span></li>
<li><span>Every man is become a fool for knowledge every artist is
confounded in his graven idol: for what he hath cast is false, and
there is no spirit in them.</span></li>
<li><span>They are vain things and a ridiculous work: in the time
of their visitation they shall perish.</span></li>
<li><span>The portion of Jacob is not like these: for it is he who
formed all things: and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: the
Lord of hosts is his name.</span></li>
<li><span>Gather up thy shame out of the land, thou that dwellest
in a siege.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord: Behold I will cast away far off
the inhabitants of the land at this time: and I will afflict them,
so that they may be found.</span></li>
<li><span>Woe is me for my destruction, my wound is very grievous.
But I said: Truly this is my own evil, and I will bear
it.</span></li>
<li><span>My tabernacle is laid waste, all my cords are broken: my
children are gone out from me, and they are not: there is none to
stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my
curtains.</span></li>
<li><span>Because the pastors have done foolishly, and have not
sought the Lord: therefore have they not understood, and all their
flock is scattered.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold the sound of a noise cometh, a great commotion out
of the land of the north: to make the cities of Juda a desert, and
a dwelling for dragons.</span></li>
<li><span>I know, O Lord, that the way of a man is not his: neither
is it in a man to walk, and to direct his steps.</span></li>
<li><span>Correct me, O Lord, but yet with judgement: and not in
fury, lest thou bring me to nothing.</span></li>
<li><span>Pour out thy indignation upon the nations that have not
known thee, and upon the provinces that have not called upon thy
name: because they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and
consumed him, and have destroyed his glory.</span></li>

them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying: Hear
ye my voice, and do all things that I command you: and you shall be
my people, and I will be your God:</span></li>
<li><span>That I may accomplish the oath which I swore to your
fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is

<li><span>And the Lord said to me: Proclaim aloud all these words
in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying:
Hear ye the words of the covenant, and do them:</span></li>

<li><span>For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods,
O Juda: and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem
thou hast set up altars of confusion, altars to offer sacrifice to
Baalim.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore, do not thou pray for this people, and do not
take up praise and prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the
time of their cry to me, in the time of their
affliction.</span></li>
<li><span>What is the meaning that my beloved hath wrought muck
wickedness in my house? shall the holy flesh take away from thee
thy crimes, in which thou hast boasted?</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord called thy name, a plentiful olive tree, fair,
fruitful, and beautiful: at the noise of a word, a great fire was
kindled in it and the branches thereof are burnt.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord of hosts that planted thee, hath pronounced
evil against thee: for the evils of the house of Israel, and the
house of Juda, which they have done to themselves, to provoke me,
offering sacrifice to Baalim.</span></li>
<li><span>But thou, O Lord, hast shewn me, and I have known: then
thou shewedst me their doings.</span></li>
<li><span>And I was as a meek lamb, that is carried to be a victim:
and I knew not that they had devised counsels against me, saying:
Let us put wood on his bread, and cut him off from the land of the
living, and let his name be remembered no more.</span></li>
<li><span>But thou, O Lord of Sabaoth, who judgest justly, and
triest the reins and hearts, let me see thy revenge on them: for to
thee I have revealed my cause.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord to the men of Anathoth, who
seek thy life, and say: Thou shalt not prophesy in the name of the
Lord, and thou shalt not die in our hands.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts: Behold I will
visit upon them: and their young men shall die by the sword, their
sons and their daughters shall die by famine.</span></li>
<li><span>And there shall be no remains of them: for I will bring
in evil upon the men of Anathoth, the year of their
visitation.</span></li>

<li><span>Thou indeed, O Lord, art just, if I plead with thee, but
yet I will speak what is just to thee: Why doth the way of the
wicked prosper: why is it well with all them that transgress, and
do wickedly?</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast planted them, and they have taken root: they
prosper and bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and
far from their reins.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou, O Lord, hast known me, thou hast seen me, and
proved my heart with thee: gather them together as sheep for a
sacrifice, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.</span></li>
<li><span>How long shall the land mourn, and the herb of every
field wither for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? The
beasts and the birds are consumed: because they have said: He shall
not see our last end.</span></li>
<li><span>If thou hast wearied with running with footmen, how canst
thou contend with horses? and if thou hast been secure in a land of
peace, what wilt thou do in the swelling of the Jordan?</span></li>
<li><span>For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even
they have fought against thee, and have cried after thee with full
voice: believe them not when they speak good things to
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>I have forsaken my house, I have left my inheritance: I
have given my dear soul into the land of her enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>My inheritance is become to me as a lion in the wood: is
hath cried out against me, therefore have I hated it.</span></li>
<li><span>Is my inheritance to me as a speckled bird? Is it as a
bird died throughout? come ye, assemble yourselves, all the beasts
of the earth, make haste to devour.</span></li>
<li><span>Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have
trodden my portion under foot: they have changed my delightful
portion into a desolate wilderness.</span></li>
<li><span>They have laid it waste, and it hath mourned for me. With
desolation is all the land made desolate; because there is none
that considereth in the heart.</span></li>
<li><span>The spoilers are come upon all the ways of the
wilderness, for the sword of the Lord shall devour from one end of
the land to the other end thereof: there is no peace for all
flesh.</span></li>
<li><span>They have sown wheat, and reaped thorns: they have
received an inheritance, and it shall not profit them: you shall be
ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce wrath of the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord against all my wicked neighbors, that
touch the inheritance that I have shared out to my people Israel:
Behold I will pluck them out of their land, and I will pluck the
house of Juda out of the midst of them.</span></li>
<li><span>And when I shall have plucked them out, I will return,
and have mercy on them: and I will bring them back, every man to
his inheritance, and every man to his land.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall come to pass, if they will be taught, and
will learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name: The Lord
liveth, as they have taught my people to swear by baal: that they
shall be built up in the midst of my people.</span></li>
<li><span>But if they will not hear, I will utterly pluck out and
destroy that nation, saith the Lord.</span></li>

<li><span>Thus saith the Lord to me: Go, and get thee a linen
girdle, and thou shalt put it about thy loins, and shalt not put it
into water.</span></li>
<li><span>And I got a girdle accoding to the word of the Lord, and
put it about my loins.</span></li>
<li><span>And the word of the Lord came to me the second time,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Take the girdle which thou hast got, which is about thy
loins, and arise, and go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a
hole of the rock.</span></li>
<li><span>And I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as the Lord had
commanded me.</span></li>
<li><span>And it came to pass after many days, that the Lord said
to me: Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take from thence the girdle,
which I commanded thee to hide there.</span></li>
<li><span>And I went to the Euphrates, and digged, and took the
girdle out of the place where I had hid it: and behold the girdle
was rotten, so that it was fit for no use.</span></li>
<li><span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: after this manner will I make the
pride of Juda, and the great pride of Jerusalem to rot.</span></li>
<li><span>This wicked people, that will not hear my words, and that
walk in the perverseness of their heart, and have gone after
strange gods to serve them, and to adore them: and they shall be as
this girdle which is fit for no use.</span></li>
<li><span>For as the girdle sticketh close to the loins of a man,
so have I brought close to me all of the house of Israel, and all
the house of Juda, saith the Lord: that they might be my people,
and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would
not hear.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt speak therefore to them this word: Thus saith
the Lord God of Israel: Every bottle shall be filled with wine, and
they shall say to thee: Do we not know that every bottle shall be
filled with wine?</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord: Behold I
will fill all the inhabitants of this land, and the kings of the
race of David that sit upon his throne, and the priests, and the
prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. with
drunkenness.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will scatter them every man from his brother, and
fathers and sons in like manner, saith the Lord: I will not spare,
and I will not pardon: nor will I have mercy, but to destroy
them.</span></li>
<li><span>Hear ye, and give ear: Be not proud, for the Lord hath
spoken.</span></li>
<li><span>Give ye glory to the Lord your God, before it be dark,
and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains: you shall
look for light, and he will turn it into the shadow of death, and
into darkness.</span></li>
<li><span>But if you will not hear this, my soul shall weep in
secret for your pride: weeping it shall weep, and my eyes shall run
down the tears, because the flock of the Lord is carried away
captive.</span></li>
<li><span>Say to the king, and to the queen: Humble yourselves, sit
down: for the crown of your glory is come down from your
head.</span></li>
<li><span>The cities of the south are shut up, and there is none to
open them: all Juda is carried away captive with an entire
captivity.</span></li>
<li><span>Lift up your eyes, and see, you that come from the north:
where is the flock that is given thee, thy beautiful
cattle?</span></li>
<li><span>What wilt thou say when he shall visit thee? for thou
hast taught them against thee, and instructed them against thy own
head: shall not sorrows lay hold on thee, as a woman in
labour?</span></li>
<li><span>And if thou shalt say in thy heart: Why are these things
come upon me? For the greatness of thy iniquity, thy nakedness is
discovered, the soles of thy feet are defiled.</span></li>
<li><span>If the Ethiopian can change his skin, or the leopard his
spots: you may also do well, when you have learned
evil.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will scatter them as stubble, which is carried away
by the wind in the desert.</span></li>
<li><span>This is thy lot, and the portion of thy measure from me,
saith the Lord, because thou hast forgotten me, and hast trusted in
falsehood.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore I have also bared my thighs against thy face,
and thy shame hath appeared.</span></li>
<li><span>I have seen thy adulteries, and thy neighing, the
wickedness of thy fornication: and thy abominations, upon the hills
in the field. Woe to thee, Jerusalem, wilt thou not be made clean

<li><span>The Word of the Lord that came to Jeremias concerning the
words of the drought.</span></li>
<li><span>Judea hath mourned, and the gates thereof are fallen, and
are become obscure on the ground, and the cry of Jerusalem is gone
up.</span></li>
<li><span>The great ones sent their inferiors to the water: they
came to draw, they found no water, they carried back their vessels
empty: they were confounded and afflicted, and covered their
heads.</span></li>
<li><span>For the destruction of the land, because there came no
rain upon the earth, the husbandmen were confounded, they covered
their heads.</span></li>
<li><span>Yea, the hind also brought forth in the field, and left
it, because there was no grass.</span></li>
<li><span>And the wild asses stood upon the rocks, they snuffed up
the wind like dragons, their eyes failed, because there was no
grass.</span></li>
<li><span>If our iniquities have testified against us, O Lord, do
thou it for thy name's sake, for our rebellions are many, we have
sinned against thee.</span></li>
<li><span>O expectation of Israel, the Saviour thereof in time of
trouble: why wilt thou be a stranger in the land, and as a
wayfaring man turning in to lodge?</span></li>
<li><span>Why wilt thou be as a wandering man, as a mighty man that
cannot save? but thou, O Lord, art among us, and thy name is called
upon by us, forsake us not.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord to his people, that have loved to
move their feet, and have not rested, and have not pleased the
Lord: He will now remember their iniquities, and visit their
sins.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to me: Pray not for this people for
their good.</span></li>
<li><span>When they fast I will not hear their prayers: and if they
offer holocausts and victims, I will not receive them: for I will
consume them by the sword, and by famine, and by the
pestilence.</span></li>
<li><span>And I said: Ah, ah, ah, O Lord God, the prophets say to
them: You shall not see the sword, and there shall be no famine
among you, but he will give you true peace in this
place.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to me: The prophets prophesy falsely in
my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, nor have I
spoken to them: they prophesy unto you a lying vision, and
divination and deceit, and the seduction of their own
heart.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets
that prophecy in my name, whom I did not send, that say: Sword and
famine shall not be in this land: By sword and famine shall those
prophets be consumed.</span></li>
<li><span>And the people to whom they prophecy, shall be cast out
in the streets of Jerusalem because of the fanmine and the sword,
and there shall be none to bury them: they and their wives, their
sons and their daughters, and I will pour out their wickedness upon
them.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt speak this word to them: Let my eyes shed
down tears night and day, and let them not cease, because the
virgin daughter of my people is afflicted with a great affliction,
with an exceeding grievous evil.</span></li>
<li><span>If I go forth into the fields, behold the slain with the
sword: and if I enter into the city, behold them that are consumed
with famine. The prophet also and the priest are gone into a land
which they knew not.</span></li>
<li><span>Hast thou utterly cast away Juda, or hath thy soul
abhorred Sion? why then hast thou struck us, so that there is no
healing for us? we have looked for peace, and there is no good: and
for the time of healing, and behold trouble.</span></li>
<li><span>We acknowledge, O Lord, our wickedness, the iniquities of
our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Give us not to be a reproach, for thy name's sake, and do
not disgrace in us the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy
covenant with us.</span></li>
<li><span>Are there any among the graven things of the Gentiles
that can send rain? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou
the Lord our God, whom we have looked for? for thou hast made all
these things.</span></li>

<li><span>And the Lord said to me: If Moses and Samuel shall stand
before me, my soul is not towards this people: cast them out from
my sight, and let them go forth.</span></li>
<li><span>And if they shall say unto thee: Whither shall we go
forth? thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord: Such as are for
death, to death: and such as are to the sword, to the sword: and
such as are for famine, to famine: and such as are to captivity, to
captivity.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will visit them with four kinds, saith the Lord:
The sword to kill, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the air,
and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will give them up to the rage of all the kingdoms
of the earth: because of Manasses the son of Ezechias the king of
Juda, for all that he did in Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>For who shall have pity on thee, O Jerusalem? or who
shall bemoan thee? or who shall go to pray for thy
peace?</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast forsaken me, saith the Lord, thou art gone
backward: and I will stretch out my hand against thee, and I will
destroy thee: I am weary of entreating thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will scatter them with a fan in the gates of the
land: I have killed and destroyed my people, and yet they are not
returned form their ways.</span></li>
<li><span>Their widows are multiplied unto me above the sand of the
sea: I have brought upon them against the mother of the young man a
spoiler at noonday: I have cast a terror on a sudden upon the
cities.</span></li>
<li><span>She that hath borne seven is become weak, her soul hath
fainted away: her sun is gone down, while it was yet day: she is
confounded, and ashamed: and the residue of them I will give up to
the sword in the sight of their enemies, saith the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Woe is me, my mother: why hast thou borne me a man of
strife, a man of contention to all the earth? I have not lent on
usury, neither hath any man lent to me on usury: yet all curse
me.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord saith to me: Assuredly it shall be well with thy
remnant, assuredly I shall help thee in the time of affliction, and
in the time of tribulation against the enemy.</span></li>
<li><span>Shall iron be allied with the iron from the north, and
the brass?</span></li>
<li><span>Thy riches and thy treasures I will give unto spoil for
nothing, because of all thy sins, even in all thy
borders.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will bring thy enemies out of a land, which thou
knowest not: for a fire is kindled in my rage, it shall burn upon
you.</span></li>
<li><span>O Lord, thou knowest, remember me, and visit me, and
defend me from them that persecute me, do not defend me in thy
patience: know that for thy sake I have sufferred
reproach.</span></li>
<li><span>Thy words were found, and I did eat them, and thy word
was to me a joy and gladness of my heart: for thy name is called
upon me, O Lord God of hosts.</span></li>
<li><span>I sat not in the assembly of jesters, nor did I make a
boast of the presence of thy hand: I sat alone, because thou hast
filled me with threats.</span></li>
<li><span>Why is my sorrow become perpetual, and my wound desperate
so as to refuse to be healed? it is become to me as the falsehood
of deceitful waters that cannot be trusted.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord: If thou wilt be converted,
I will convert thee, and thou shalt stand before my face; and if
thou wilt separate the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my
mouth: they shall be turned to thee, and thou shalt not be turned
to them.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will make thee to this people as a strong wall of
brass: and they shall fight against thee, and shall not prevail:
for I am with thee to save thee, and to deliver thee, saith the
Lord.</span></li>

and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the mighty.</span></li>

<li><span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have
thee sons and daughters in this place.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord concerning the sons and
daughters, that are born in this place, and concerning their
mothers that bore them: and concerning their fathers, of whom they
were born in this land:</span></li>
<li><span>They shall die by the death of grievous illnesses: they

as dung upon the face of the earth: and they shall be consumed with

<li><span>Both the great and the little shall die in the land: they
shall not be buried nor lamented, and men shall not cut themselves,
nor make themselves bald for them.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall not break bread among them to him that

Behold I will take away out of this place in your sight, and in
your days the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice
of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.</span></li>
<li><span>And when thou shalt tell this people all these words, and
they shall say to thee: Wherefore hath the Lord pronounced against
us all this great evil? what is our iniquity? and what is our sin,
that we have sinned against the Lord our God?</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt say to them: Because your fathers forsook me,
saith the Lord: and went after strange gods, and served them, and
adored them: and they forsook me, and kept not my law.</span></li>
<li><span>And you also have done worse than your fathers: for
behold every one of you walketh after the perverseness of his evil
heart, so as not to hearken to me.</span></li>

which you know not, nor you fathers: and there you shall serve
strange gods day and night, which shall not give you any
rest.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore behold the days come, saith the Lord, when it
shall be said no more: The Lord liveth, that brought for the
children of Israel out of the land of Egypt:</span></li>
<li><span>But, the Lord liveth, that brought the children of Israel
out of the land of the north, and out of all the lands to which I
cast them out: and I will bring them again into their land, which I
gave to their fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I will send many fishers, saith the Lord, and they
shall fish them: and after this I will send them many hunters, and
they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and
out of the holes of the rocks.</span></li>
<li><span>For my eyes are upon all their ways: they are not hid
from my face, and their iniquity hath not been hid from my

<li><span>And I will repay first their double iniquities, and their
sins: because they have defiled my land with the carcasses of their
idols, and they have filled my inheritance with their
abominations.</span></li>
<li><span>O Lord, my might, and my strength, and my refuge in the
day of tribulation: to thee the Gentiles shall come from the ends

lies, a vanity which hath not profited them.</span></li>

was doing a work on the wheel.</span></li>
<li><span>And the vessel was broken which he was making with clay
with his hands: and turning he made another vessel, as it seemed
good in his eyes to make it.</span></li>
<li><span>Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Cannot I do with you as this potter, saith the Lord?
behold as clay is in the hand of the potter, so are you in my hand,
O house of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>I will suddenly speak against a nation, and against a
kingdom, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy
it.</span></li>
<li><span>If that nation against which I have spoken, shall repent
of their evil, I also will repent of the evil that I have thought
to do to them.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will suddenly speak of a nation and of a kingdom,
to build up and plant it.</span></li>
<li><span>If it shall do evil in my sight, that it obey not my
voice: I will repent of the good that I have spoken to do unto
it.</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore tell the men of Juda, and the inhabitants
of Jerusalem, saying: Thus saith the Lord: Behold I frame evil
against you, and devise a device against you: let every man of you
return from his evil way, and make ye your ways and your doings
good.</span></li>
<li><span>And they said: We have no hopes: for we will go after our
own thoughts, and we will do every one according to the
perverseness of his evil heart.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord: Ask among the nations: Who
hath heard such horrible things, as the virgin of Israel hath done
to excess?</span></li>
<li><span>Shall now the snow of Libanus fail from the rock of the
field? or can the cold waters that gush out and run down, be taken
away?</span></li>
<li><span>Because my people have forgotten me, sacrificing in vain,
and stumbling in their ways, in ancient paths, to walk by them in a
way not trodden:</span></li>
<li><span>That their land might be given up to desolation, and to a
perpetual hissing: every one that shall pass by it, shall be
astonished, and wag his head.</span></li>
<li><span>As a burning will I scatter them before the enemy: I will
shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their
destruction.</span></li>
<li><span>And they said: Come, and let us invent devices against
Jeremias: for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel
from the wise, nor the word from the prophet: come, and let us
strike him with the tongue, and let us give no heed to all his
words.</span></li>
<li><span>Give heed to me, O Lord, and hear the voice of my
adversaries.</span></li>
<li><span>Shall evil be rendered for good, because they have digged
a pit for my soul? Remember that I have stood in thy sight, so
speak good for them, and turn away thy indignation from
them.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore deliver up their children to famine, and bring
them into the hands of the sword: let their wives be bereaved of
children and widows: and let their husbands be slain by death: let
their young men be stabbed with the sword in battle.</span></li>
<li><span>Let a cry be heard out of their houses: for thou shalt
bring the robber upon them suddenly: because they have digged a pit
to take me, and have hid snares for my feet.</span></li>
<li><span>But thou, O Lord, knowest all their counsel against me
unto death: forgive not their iniquity, and let not their sin be
blotted out from thy sight: let them be overthrown before thy eyes,
in the time of thy wrath do thou destroy them.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: Go, and take a potter's earthen
bottle, and take of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients
of the priests:</span></li>
<li><span>And go forth into the valley of the son of Ennom, which
is by the entry of the earthen gate: and there thou shalt proclaim
the words that I shall tell thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt say: Hear the word of the Lord, O ye kings
of Juda, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem: Thus saith the Lord of
hosts, the God of Israel: Behold I will bring an affliction upon
this place: so that whoever shall hear it, his ears shall
tingle:</span></li>
<li><span>Because they have forsaken me, and have profaned this
place: and have sacrificed therein to strange gods, whom neither
they nor their fathers knew, nor the kings of Juda: and they have
filled this place with the blood of innocents.</span></li>
<li><span>And they have built the high places of Baalim, to burn
their children with fire for a holocaust to Baalim: which I did not
command, nor speak of, neither did it once come into my
mind.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore behold the days come, saith the Lord, that this
place shall no more be called Topheth, nor the valley of the son of
Ennom, but the valley of slaughter.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will defeat the counsel of Juda and of Jerusalem in
this place: and I will destroy them with the sword in the sight of
their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and
I will give their carcasses to be meat for the fowls of the air,
and for the beasts of the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will make this city an astonishent, and a hissing:
every one that shall pass by it, shall be astonished, and shall
hiss because of all the plagues thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will feed them with the flesh of their sons, and
with the flesh of their daughters: and they shall eat every one the
flesh of his friend in the siege, and in the distress wherewith
their enemies, and they that seek their lives shall straiten
them.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt break the bottle in the sight of the men
that shall go with thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord of hosts:
even so will I break this people, and this city, as the potter's
vessel is broken, which cannot be made whole again: and they shall
be buried in Topheth, because there is no other place to bury
in.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus will I do to this place, saith the Lord, and to the
inhabitants thereof: and I will make this city as
Topheth.</span></li>
<li><span>And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of Juda shall
be unclean as the place of Topheth: all the houses upon whose roots
they have sacrificed to all the host of heaven, and have poured out
drink offerings to strange gods.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Jeremias came from Topheth, whither the Lord had
sent him to prophecy, and he stood in the court of the house of the
Lord, and said to all people:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold I
will bring in upon this city, and upon all the cities thereof all
the evils that I have spoken against it: because they have hardened
their necks, and they might not hear my words.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="20">Jeremias 20</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Now Phassur the son of Emmur, the priest, who was
appointed chief in the house of the Lord, heard Jeremias
prophesying these words.</span></li>
<li><span>And Phassur struck Jeremias the prophet, and put him in
the stocks, that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, in the house
of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And when it was light the next day, Phassur brought
Jeremias out of the stocks. And Jeremias said to him: The Lord hath
not called thy name Phassur, but fear on every side.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord: Behold I will deliver thee up to
fear, thee and all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of
their enemies, and thy eyes shall see it, and I will give all Juda
into the hand of the king of Babylon: and he shall strike them with
the sword.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will give all the substance of this city, and all
its labour, and every precious thing thereof, and all the treasures
of the kings of Juda will I give into the hands of their enemies:
and they shall pillage them, and take them away, and carry them to
Babylon.</span></li>
<li><span>But thou, Phassur, and all that dwell in thy house, shall
go into captivity, and thou shalt go to Babylon, and there thou
shalt die, and there thou shalt be buried, thou and all thy
friends, to whom thou hast prophesied a lie.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast deceived me, O Lord, and I am deceived: thou
hast been stronger than I, and thou hast prevailed. I am become a
laughing-stock all the day, all scoff at me.</span></li>
<li><span>For I am speaking now this long time, crying out against
iniquity, and I often proclaim devistation: and the word of the
Lord is made a reproach to me, and a derision all the
day.</span></li>
<li><span>Then I said: I will not make mention of him, nor speak
any more in his name: and there came in my heart as a burning fire
shut up in my bones, and I was wearied, not being able to bear
it.</span></li>
<li><span>For I heard the reproaches of many, and terror on every
side: Persecute him, and let us persecute him: from all the men
that were my familiars, and continued at my side: if by any means
he may be deceived, and we may prevail against him, and be revenged
on him.</span></li>
<li><span>But the Lord is with me as a strong warrior: therefore
they that persecute me shall fall, and shall be weak: they shall be
greatly confounded, because they have not understood the
everlasting reproach, which never shall be effaced.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou, O Lord of hosts, prover of the just, who seest
the reins and the heart: let me see, I beseech thee, thy vengeance
on them: for to thee I have laid open my cause.</span></li>
<li><span>Sing ye to the Lord, praise the Lord: because he hath
delivered the soul of the poor out of the hand of the
wicked.</span></li>
<li><span>Cursed be the day wherein I was borne: let not the day in
which my mother bore me, be blessed.</span></li>
<li><span>Cursed be the man that brought the tidings to my father,
saying: A man child is born to thee: and made him greatly
rejoice.</span></li>
<li><span>Let that man be as the cities that the Lord hath
overthrown, and hath not repented: let him hear a cry in the
morning, and howling at noontide:</span></li>
<li><span>Who slew me not from the womb, that my mother might have
been my grave, and her womb an everlasting conception.</span></li>
<li><span>Why came I out of the womb, to see labour and sorrow, and
that my days should be spent in confusion?</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="21">Jeremias 21</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord, when king
Sedecias sent unto him Phassur, the son of Melchias, and Sophonias,
the son of Maasias the priest, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Inquire of the Lord for us, for Nabuchodonosor king of
Babylon maketh war against us: if so be the Lord will deal with us
according to all his wonderful works, that he may depart from
us.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jeremias said to them: Thus shall you say to
Sedecias:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: Behold I will
turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, with which you
fight against the king of Babylon, and the Chaldeans, that besiege
you round about the walls: and I will gather them together in the
midst of this city.</span></li>
<li><span>And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched
hand, and with a strong arm, and in fury, and in indignation, and
in great wrath.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will strike the inhabitants of this city, men and
beasts shall die of a great pestilence.</span></li>
<li><span>And after this, saith the Lord, I will give Sedecias the
king of Juda, and his servants, and his people, and such as are
left in this city from the pestilence, and the sword , and the
famine, into the hand of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon, and
into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek
their life, and he shall strike them with the edge of the sword,
and he shall not be moved to pity, nor spare them, nor shew mercy
on them.</span></li>
<li><span>And to this people thou shalt say: Thus saith the Lord:
Behold I set before you the way of life, and the way of
death.</span></li>
<li><span>He that shall abide in this city, shall die by the sword,
and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that shall go out
and flee over to the Chaldeans, that besiege you, shall live, and
his life shall be to him as a spoil.</span></li>
<li><span>For I have set my face against this city for evil, and
not for good, saith the Lord: it shall be given into the hand of
the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.</span></li>
<li><span>And to the house of the king of Juda: Hear ye the word of
the Lord,</span></li>
<li><span>O house of David, this saith the Lord: Judge ye judgement
in the morning, and deliver him that is oppressed by violence out
of the hand of the oppressor: lest my indignation go forth like a
fire, and be kindled, and there be none to quench it, because of
the evil of your ways.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I come to thee that dwelleth in a valley upon a
rock above a plain, saith the Lord: and you say: Who shall strike
us? and who shall enter into our houses?</span></li>
<li><span>But I will visit upon you according to the fruit of your
doings, saith the Lord: and I will kindle a fire in the forest
thereof: and it shall devour all things round about it.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="22">Jeremias 22</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: Go down to the house of the king of
Juda, and there thou shalt speak this word,</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt say: Hear the word of the Lord, O king of
Juda, that sittest upon the throne of David: thou and thy servants,
and thy people, who enter in by these gates.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: Execute judgement and justice, and
deliver him that is oppressed out of the hand of the oppressor: and
afflict not the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, nor
oppress them unjustly: and shed not innocent blood in this
place.</span></li>
<li><span>For if you will do this thing indeed, then shall there
enter in by the gates of this house, kings of the race of David
sitting upon his throne, and riding in chariots and on horses, they
and their servants, and their people.</span></li>
<li><span>But if you will not hearken to these words: I swear by
myself, saith the Lord, that this house shall become a
desolation.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord to the house of the king of Juda:
Thou art to me Galaad the head of Libanus: yet surely I will make
thee a wilderness, and cities not habitable.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will prepare against thee the destroyer and his
weapons: and they shall cut down thy chosen cedars, and shall cast
them headlong into the fire.</span></li>
<li><span>And many nations shall pass by this city: and they shall
say every man to his neighbor: Why hath the Lord done so to this
great city?</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall answer: Because they have forsaken the
covenant of the Lord their God, and have adored strange gods, and
served them.</span></li>
<li><span>Weep not for him that is dead, nor bemoan him with your
tears: lament him that goeth away, for he shall return no more, nor
see his native country.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord to Sellum the son of Josias the
king of Juda, who reigned instead of his father, who went forth out
of this place: He shall return hither no more:</span></li>
<li><span>But in the place, to which I have removed him, there
shall he die, and he shall not see this land any more.</span></li>
<li><span>Woe to him that buildeth up his house by injustice, and
his chambers not in judgement: that will oppress his friend without
cause, and will not pay him his wages.</span></li>
<li><span>Who saith: I will build me a wide house and large
chambers: who openeth to himself windows, and maketh roofs of
cedar, and painteth them with vermilion.</span></li>
<li><span>Shalt thou reign, because thou comparest thyself to the
cedar? did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and
justice, and it was then well with him?</span></li>
<li><span>He judged the cause of the poor and needy for his own
good: was it not therefore because he knew me, saith the
Lord?</span></li>
<li><span>But thy eyes and thy heart are set upon covetousness, and
upon shedding innocent blood, and upon oppression, and running
after evil works.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning Joakim the son
of Josias king of Juda: They shall not mourn for him, Alas, my
brother, and Alas, sister: they shall not lament for him, Alas, my
Lord, or, Alas, the noble one.</span></li>
<li><span>He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, rotten and
cast forth without the gates of Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>Go up to Libanus, and cry: and lift up thy voice in
Basan, and cry to them that pass by, for all thy lovers are
destroyed.</span></li>
<li><span>I spoke to thee in thy properity: and thoiu saidst: I
will not hear: this hath been thy way from thy youth, because thou
hast not heard my voice.</span></li>
<li><span>The wind shall feed all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall
go into captivity: and then shalt thou be confounded, and ashamed
of all thy wickedness.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou that sittest in Libanus, and makest thy nest in the
cedars, how hast thou mourned when sorrows came upon thee, as the
pains of a woman in labour?</span></li>
<li><span>As I live, saith the Lord, if Jechonias the son of Joakim
the king of Juda were a ring on my right hand, I would pluck him
thence.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy
life, and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest, and into
the hand of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and into the hand of
the Chaldeans.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will send thee, and thy mother that bore thee, into
a strange country, in which you were not born, and there you shall
die:</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall not return into the land, whereunto they
lift up their mind to return thither.</span></li>
<li><span>Is this man Jechonias an earthen and a broken vessel? is
he a vessel wherein there is no pleasure? why are they cast out, he
and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know
not?</span></li>
<li><span>O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: Write this man barren, a man that
shall not prosper in his days: for there shall not be a man of his
seed that shall sit upon the throne of David, and have power any
more in Juda.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>Woe to the pastors, that destroy and tear the sheep of my
pasture, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord the God of Israel to the
pastors that feed my people: You have scattered my flock, and
driven them away, and have not visited them: behold I will visit
upon you for the evil of your doings, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will gather together the remnant of my flock, out
of all the lands into which I have cast them out: and I will make
them return to their own fields, and they shall increase and be
multiplied.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will set up pastors over them, and they shall feed
them: they shall fear no more, and they shall not be dismayed: and
none shall be wanting of their number, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will raise up
to David a just branch: and a king shall reign, and shall be wise,
and shall execute judgement and justice in the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>In those days shall Juda be saved, and Israel shall dwell
confidently: and this is the name that they shall call him: the
Lord our just one.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore behold the days to come, saith the Lord, and
they shall say no more: The Lord liveth, who brought up the
children of Israel out of the land of Egypt:</span></li>
<li><span>But the Lord liveth, who hath brought out, and brought
hither the seed of the house of Israel from the land of the north,
and out of all the lands, to which I had cast them forth: and they
shall dwell in their own land.</span></li>
<li><span>To the prophets: My heart is broken within me, all my
bones tremble: I am become as a drunken man, and as a man full of
wine, at the presence of the Lord, and at the presence of his holy
words.</span></li>
<li><span>Because the land is full of adulterers, because the land
hath mourned by reason of cursing, the fields of the desert are
dried up: and their course is become evil, and their strength
unlike.</span></li>
<li><span>For the prophet and the priest are defiled: and in my
house I have found their wickedness, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore their way shall be as a slippery way in the
dark: for they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will
bring evils upon them, the year of their visitation, saith the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria: they
prophesied in Baal, and deceived my people Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And I have seen the likeness of adulterers, and the way
of lying in the peophets of Jerusalem: and they strengthened the
hand of the wicked, that no man should return from his evil doings:
that are all become unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof
as Gamorrha.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts to the prophets:
Behold I will feed them with wormwood, and I will give them gall to
drink: for from the prophets of Jerusalem corruption has gone forth
into all the land.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Hearken not to the words of
the prophets that prophesy to you, and deceive you: they speak a
vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>They say tothem that blaspheme me: The Lord hath said:
You shall have peace: and to every one that walketh in the
perverseness of his own heart, they have said: No evil shall come
to you.</span></li>
<li><span>For who hath stood in the counsel of the Lord, and hath
seen and heard his word? Who hath considered his word and heard
it?</span></li>
<li><span>Behold the whirlwind of the Lord's indignation shall come
forth, and a tempest shall break out and come upon the head of the
wicked.</span></li>
<li><span>The wrath of the Lord shall not return till he execute
it, and till he accomplish the thought of his heart: in the latter
days you shall understand his counsel.</span></li>
<li><span>I did not send prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken
to them, yet they prophesied.</span></li>
<li><span>If they stood in my counsel, and had made my words known
to my people, I should have turned them from their evil way and
from their wicked doings.</span></li>
<li><span>Am I, think ye, a God at hand, saith the Lord, and not a
God afar off?</span></li>
<li><span>Shall a man be hid in secret places, and I not see him,
saith the Lord? do not I fill heaven and earth, saith the
Lord?</span></li>
<li><span>I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesylies in
my name, and say: I have dreamed, I have dreamed.</span></li>
<li><span>How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that
prophesy lies, and that prophesy the delusions of their own
heart?</span></li>
<li><span>Who seek to make my people forget my name through their
dreams, which they tell every man to his neighbor: as their fathers
forgot my name for Baal.</span></li>
<li><span>The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream: and
he that hath my word, let him speak my word with truth: what hath
the chaff to do with the wheat, saith the Lord?</span></li>
<li><span>Are not my words as a fire, saith the Lord: and as a
hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore behold I am against the prophets, saith the
Lord: who steal my words every one from his neighbor.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I am against the prophets, saith the Lord: who use
their tongues, and say: The Lord saith it.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I am against the prophets that have lying dreams,
saith the Lord: and tell them, and cause my people to err by their
lying, and by their wonders: when I sent them not, nor commanded
them, who have not profited this people at all, saith the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>If therefore this people, or the prophet, or the priest
shall ask thee, saying: What is the burden of the Lord? thou shalt
say to them: You are the burden: for I will cast you away, saith
the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people
that shall say: The burden of the Lord: I will visit upon that man,
and upon his house.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus shall you say every one to his neighbor, and to his
brother: What hath the Lord answered? and what hath the Lord
spoken?</span></li>
<li><span>And the burden of the Lord shall be mentioned no more,
for every man's word shall be his burden: for you have perverted
the words of the living God, of the Lord of hosts our
God.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus shalt thou say to the prophet: What hath the Lord
answered thee? and what hath the Lord spoken?</span></li>
<li><span>But if you shall say: The burden of the Lord: therefore
thus saith the Lord: Because you have said this word: The burden of
the Lord: and I have sent to you saying: Say not, Tne burden of the
Lord:</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore behold I will take you away carrying you, and
will forsake you, and the city which I gave to you, and to your
fathers, out of my presence.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a
perpetual shame which shall never be forgotten.</span></li>

<li><span>The Lord shewed me: and behold two baskets full of figs,
set before the temple of the Lord: after that Nabuchodonosor king
of Babylon had carried away Jechonias the son of Joakim the king of
Juda, and his chief men, and the craftsmen, and engravers of
Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.</span></li>
<li><span>One basket had very good figs, like the figs of the first
season: and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be
eaten, because they were bad.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to me: What seest thou, Jeremias? And I
said: Figs, the good figs, very good: and the bad figs, very bad,
which cannot be eaten because they are bad.</span></li>
<li><span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Like these good
figs, so will I regard the captives of Juda, whom I have sent forth
out of this place into the land oif the Chaldeans, for their own
good.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will set my eyes upon them to be pacified, and I
will bring them again into this land: and I will be their God: and
I will build them up, and not pull them down: and I will plant
them, and not pluck them up.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the
Lord: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: because
they shall return to me with their whole heart.</span></li>
<li><span>And as the very bad figs, that cannot be eaten, because
they are bad: thus saith the Lord: So will I give Sedecias the king
of Juda, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that have
remained in this city, and that dwell in the land of
Egypt.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will deliver them up to vexation, and affliction,
to all the kingdoms of the earth: to be a reproach, and a byword,
and a proverb, and to be a curse in all places, to which I have
cast them out.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will send among them the sword, and the famine, and
the pestilence: till they be consumed out of the land which I gave
to them, and their fathers.</span></li>

<li><span>The word that came to Jeremias concerning all the people
of Juda, in the fourth year of Joakim the son of Josias king of
Juda, (the same is the first year of Nabuchodonosor king of
Babylon,)</span></li>
<li><span>Which Jeremias the prophet spoke to all the people of
Juda, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>From the thirteenth year of Josias the son of Ammon king
of Juda until this day: this is the three and twentieth year, the
word of the Lord hath come to me, and I have spoken to you, rising
before day, and speaking, and you have not hearkened.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord hath sent to you all his servants the
prophets, rising early, and sending, and you have not hearkened,
nor inclined your ears to hear.</span></li>
<li><span>When he said: Return ye, every one from his evil way, and
from your wicked devices, and you shall dwell in the land which the
Lord hath given to you, and your fathers for ever and
ever.</span></li>
<li><span>And go not after strange gods to serve them, and adore
them: nor provoke me to wrath by the works of your hands, and I
will not afflict you.</span></li>
<li><span>And you have not heard me, saith the Lord, that you might
provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, to your own
hurt.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts: Because you have
not heard my words:</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I will send, and take all the kindreds of the
north, saith the Lord, and Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon my
servant: and I will bring them against this land, and against the
inhabitants thereof, and against all the nations that are round
about it: and I will destroy them, and make them an astonishment
and a hissing, and perpetual desolations.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will take away from them the voice of mirth, and
the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice
of the bride, the sound of the mill, and the light of the
lamp.</span></li>
<li><span>And all this land shall be a desolation, and an
astonishment: and all these nations shall serve the king of Babylon
seventy years.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the seventy years shall be expired, I will
punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the Lord, for
their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans: and I will make it
perpetual desolations.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will bring upon the land all my words, that I have
spoken against it, all that is written in this book, all that
Jeremias hath prophesied against all nations:</span></li>
<li><span>For they have served them, whereas they were many
nations, and great kings: and I will repay them according to their
deeds, and according to the works of their hands.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Take
the cup of wine of this fury at my hand: and thou shalt make all
nations to drink thereof, unto which I shall send thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall drink, and be troubled, and be mad because
of the sword, which I shall send among them.</span></li>
<li><span>And I took the cup at the hand of the Lord, and I
presented it to all the nations to drink of it, to which the Lord
sent me:</span></li>
<li><span>To wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Juda, and the kings
thereof, and the princes thereof: to make them a desolation, and an
astonishment, and a hissing, and a curse, as it is at this
day.</span></li>
<li><span>Pharao the king of Egypt, and his servants, and his
princes, and all his people,</span></li>
<li><span>And all in general: all the kings of the land of Ausitis,
and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ascalon, and
Gaza, and Accaron, and the remnant of Azotus.</span></li>
<li><span>And Edom, and Moab, and the children of
Ammon.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Sidon:
and the kings of the land of the islands that are beyond the
sea.</span></li>
<li><span>And Dedan, and Thema, and Buz, and all that have their
hair cut round.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the
west, that dwell in the desert.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the kings of Zambri, and all the kings of Elam,
and all the kings of Medes:</span></li>
<li><span>And all the kings of the north far and near, every one
against his brother: and all the kingdoms of the earth, which are
upon the face thereof: and the king of Sesac shall drink after
them.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord of hosts
the God of Israel: Dring ye, and be drunken, and vomit: and fall,
and rise no more, because of the sword, which I shall send among
you.</span></li>
<li><span>And if they refuse to take the cup at thy hand to drink,
thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Drinking you
shall drink:</span></li>
<li><span>For behold I begin to bring evil on the city wherein my
name is called upon: and shall you be as innocent and escape free?
you shall not escape free: for I will call for the sword upon all
the inhabitants of the earth, saith the Lord of hosts.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt prophesy unto them all these words, and
thou shalt say to them: The Lord shall roar from on high, and shall
utter his voice from his holy habitation: roaring he shall roar
upon the place of his beauty: the shout as it were of them that
tread grapes shall be given out against all the inhabitants of the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>The noise is come even to the ends of the earth: for the
Lord entereth into judgement with the nations: he entereth into
judgement with all flesh; the wicked I have delivered up to the
sword, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Behold evil shall go forth
from nation to nation: and a great whirlwind shall go forth from
the ends of the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one
end of the earth even to the other end thereof: they shall not be
lamented, and they shall not be gathered up, nor buried: they shall
lie as dung upon the face of the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>Howl, ye shepherds, and cry: and sprinkle yourselves with
ashes, ye leaders of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and
your dispersion are accomplished, and you shall fall like precious
vessels.</span></li>
<li><span>And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the
leaders of the flock to save themselves.</span></li>
<li><span>A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and a howling of the
principal of the flock: because the Lord hath watsed their
pastures.</span></li>
<li><span>And the fields of peace have been silent, because of the
fierce anger of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>He has forsaken his covert as the lion, for the land is
laid waste because of the wrath of the dove, and because of the
fierce anger of the Lord.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="26">Jeremias 26</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>In the beginning of the reign of Joakim the son of Josias
king of Juda, came this word from the Lord, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: Stand in the court of the house of
the Lord, and speak to all the cities of Juda, out of which they
come, to adore in the house of the Lord, all the words which I have
commanded thee to to speak unto them: leave not out one
word.</span></li>
<li><span>If so be they will hearken and be converted every one
from his evil way; that I may repent me of the evil that I think to
do unto them for the wickedness of their doings.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord: If you
will not hearken to me to walk in my law, which I have given to
you:</span></li>
<li><span>To give ear to the words of my servants the prophets,
whom I sent to you rising up early: and sending, and you have not
hearkened:</span></li>
<li><span>I will make this house like Silo: and I will make this
city a curse to all the nations of the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And the priests, and the prophets, and all the people
heard Jeremias speaking these words in the house of the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Jeremias made an end of speaking all that the
Lord had commanded him to speak to all the people, the priests, and
the prophets, and all the people laid hold on him, saying: Let him
be put to death.</span></li>
<li><span>Why hath he prophesied in the name of the Lord, saying:
This house shall be like Silo; and this city shall be made
desolate, without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered
together against Jeremias in the house of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And the princes of Juda heard these words: and they went
up from the king's house into the house of the Lord, and sat in the
entry of the new gate of the house of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes,
and to all the people, saying: The judgement of death is for this
man: because he hath prophesied against this city, as you have
heard with your ears.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Jeremias spoke to all the princes, and to all the
people, saying: The Lord sent me to prophesy concerning this house,
and concerning this city all the words you have heard.</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore amend your ways, and your doings, and
hearken to the voice of the Lord your God: and the Lord will repent
of the evil that he hath spoken against you.</span></li>
<li><span>But as for me, behold I am in your hands: do with me what
is good and right in your eyes:</span></li>
<li><span>But know ye, and understand, that if you put me to death,
you will shed innocent blood against your own selves, and against
this city, and the inhabitants thereof. For in truth the Lord sent
me to you, to speak all these words in your hearing.</span></li>
<li><span>Then the princes, and all the people said to the priests,
and to the prophets: There is no judgement of death for this man:
for he hath spoken to us in the name of the Lord our
God.</span></li>
<li><span>And some of the ancients of the land rose up: and they
spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Micheas of Morasthi was a prophet in the days of Ezechias
king of Juda, and he spoke to all the people of Juda, saying: Thus
saith the Lord of hosts: Sion shall be ploughed like a field, and
Jerusalem shall be a heap of stones: and the mountain of the house
the high places of woods.</span></li>
<li><span>Did Ezechias king of Juda, and all Juda, condemn him to
death? did they not fear the Lord, and beseech the face of the
Lord: and the Lord repented of the evil that they had spoken
against them? therefore we are doing a great evil against our
souls.</span></li>
<li><span>There was also a man that prophesied in the name of the
Lord, Urias the son of Semei of Cariathiarim: and he prophesied
against this city, and against this land, according to all the
words of Jeremias.</span></li>
<li><span>And Joakim, and all his men in power, and his princes
heard these words: and the king sought to put him to death. And
Urias heard it, and was afraid, and fled and went into
Egypt.</span></li>
<li><span>And king Joakim sent men into Egypt, Elnathan the son of
Achobor, and men with him into Egypt.</span></li>
<li><span>And they brought Urias out of Egypt: and brought him to
king Joakim, and he slew him with the sword: and he cast his dead
body into the graves of the common people.</span></li>
<li><span>So the hand of Ahicam the son of Saphan was with
Jeremias, that he should not be delivered into the hands of the
people, to put him to death.</span></li>

</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="27">Jeremias 27</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>In the beginning of the reign of Joakim the son of Josias
king of Juda, this word came to Jeremias from the Lord,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord to me: Make thee bands, and chains:
and thou shalt put them on thy neck.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt send them to the of Edom, and to the king
of Moab, and to the king of the children of Ammon, and to the king
of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon: by the hand of the messengers
that are come to Jerusalem to Sedecias the king of
Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt command them to speak to their masters:
Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Thus shall you say
to your masters:</span></li>
<li><span>I made the earth, and the men, and the beasts that are
upon the face of the earth, by my great power, and by my stretched
out arm: and I have given it to whom it seemed good in my
eyes.</span></li>
<li><span>And now I have given all these lands into the hand of
Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon my servant: moreover also the beasts
of the field I have given him to serve him.</span></li>
<li><span>And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his
son's son: till the time come for his land and himself: and many
nations and great kings shall serve him.</span></li>
<li><span>But the nation and kingdom that will not serve
Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and whosoever will not bend his
neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon: I will visit upon that
nation with the sword, and with famine, and with pestilence, saith
the Lord: till I consume them by his hand.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore hearken not to your prophets, and diviners, and
dreamers, and soothsayers, and sorcerers, that say to you: You
shall not serve the king Babylon.</span></li>
<li><span>For they prophesy lies to you: to remove you far from
your country, and east you out, and to make you perish.</span></li>
<li><span>But the nation that shall bend down their neck under the
yoke of the king Babylon, and shall serve him: Will let them remain
in their own land, saith the Lord: and they shall till it, and
dwell in it.</span></li>
<li><span>And I spoke to Sedecias the king of Juda according to all
these words, saying: Bend down your necks under the yoke of the
king of Babylon, and serve him, and his people, and you shall
live.</span></li>
<li><span>Why will you die, thou and thy people by the sword, and
by famine, and by the pestilence, as the Lord hath spoken against
the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?</span></li>
<li><span>Hearken not to the words of the prophets that say to you:
You shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they tell you a
lie.</span></li>
<li><span>For I have not sent them, saith the Lord: and they
prophesy in my name falsely: to drive you out, and that you may
perish, both you, and the prophets that prophesy to
you.</span></li>
<li><span>I spoke also to the priests, and to this people, saying:
Thus saith the Lord: Hearken not to the words of your prophets,
that prophesy to you, saying: Behold the vessels of the Lord shall
now in a short time be brought again from Babylon: for they
prophesy a lie unto you.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore hearken not to them, but serve the king of
Babylon, that you may live. Why should this city be given up to
desolation?</span></li>
<li><span>But if they be prophets, and the word of the Lord be in
them: let them interpose themselves before the Lord of hosts, that
the vessels which were left in the house of the Lord, and in the
house of the king of Juda, and in Jerusalem, may not go to
Babylon.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord of hosts d to the pillars, and to
the sea, and to the bases, and to the rest of the vessels that
remain in this city:</span></li>
<li><span>Which Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon did not take,
when he carried away Jechonias the son of Joakim the king of Juda,
from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the great men of Juda and
Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel, to
the vessels that are left in the house of the Lord, and in the
house of the king of Juda and Jerusalem:</span></li>
<li><span>They shall be carried to Babylon, and there they shall be
until the day of their visitation, saith the Lord: and I will cause
them to be brought, and to be re- stored in this place.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="28">Jeremias 28</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And it came to pass in that year, in the beginning of the
reign of Sedecias king of Juda, in the fourth year, in the fifth
month, that Hananias the son of Azur, a prophet of Gabaon spoke to
me, in the house of the Lord before the priests, and all the
people, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: I have
broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.</span></li>
<li><span>As yet two years of days, and I will cause all the
vessels of the house of the Lord to be brought back into this
place, which Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon took away from this
place, and carried them to Babylon.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will bring back to this place Jechonias the son of
Joakim king of Juda, and all the captives of Juda, that are gone to
Babylon, saith the Lord: for I will break the yoke of the king of
Babylon.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jeremias the prophet said to Hananias the prophet in
the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people
that stood in the house of the Lord:</span></li>
<li><span>And Jeremias the prophet said: Amen, the Lord do so: the
Lord perform thy words, which thou hast prophesied: that the
vessels may be brought again into the house of the Lord, and all
the captives may return out of Babylon to this place.</span></li>
<li><span>Nevertheless hear this word that I speak in thy ears, and
in the ears of all the people:</span></li>
<li><span>The prophets that have been before me, and before thee
from the beginning, and have prophesied concerning many countries,
and concerning great kingdoms, of war, and of affliction, and of
famine.</span></li>
<li><span>The prophet that prophesied peace when his word shall
come to pass, the prophet shall be known, whom the Lord hath sent
in truth.</span></li>
<li><span>And Hananias the prophet took the chain from the neck of
Jeremias the prophet, and broke it.</span></li>
<li><span>And Hananias spoke in the presence of all the people,
saying: Thus saith the Lord: Even so will I break the yoke of
Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon after two full years from off
the neck of all the nations.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jeremias the prophet went his way. And the word of
the Lord came to Jeremias, after that Hananias the prophet had
broken the chain from off the neck of Jeremias the prophet,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Go, and tell Hananias: Thus saith the Lord: Thou hast
broken chains of wood, and thou shalt make for them chains of
iron.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: I
have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, to
serve Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and they shall serve him:
moreover also I have given him the beasts of the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jeremias the prophet said to Hananias the prophet:
Hear now, Hananias: the Lord hath not sent thee, and thou hast made
this people to trust in a lie.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord: Behold I will send thee
away from off the face of the earth: this year shalt thou die: for
thou hast spoken against the Lord.</span></li>

seventh month.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="29">Jeremias 29</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Now these are the words of the letter which Jeremias, the
prophet sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the ancients that
were carried into captivity, and to the priests, and to the
prophets, and to all the people, whom Nabuchodonosor had carried
away from Jerusalem to Babylon:</span></li>
<li><span>After that Jechonias the king, and the queen, and the
eunuchs, and the princes of Juda, and of Jerusalem, and the
craftsman, and the engravers were departed out of Jerusalem
:</span></li>
<li><span>By the hand of Elasa the son of Saphan, and Gamarias the
son of Helcias, whom Sedecias king of Juda sent to Babylon to
Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel, to all
that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried
away from Jerusalem to Babylon:</span></li>
<li><span>Build ye houses, and dwell in them: and plant orchards,
and eat the fruit of them.</span></li>
<li><span>Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters: and take
wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, and let
them bear sons and daughters: and be ye multiplied there, and be
not few in number.</span></li>
<li><span>And seek the peace of the city, to which I have caused
you to be carried away captives; and pray to the Lord for it: for
in the peace thereof shall be your peace.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord of hoses the God of Israel: Let
not your prophets that are in the midst of you, and your diviners
deceive you: and give no heed to your dreams which you
dream:</span></li>
<li><span>For they prophesy falsely to you in my name: and I have
not sent them, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord: When the seventy years shall
begin to be accomplished in Babylon, I will visit you: and I will
perform my good word in your favour, to bring you again to this
place.</span></li>
<li><span>For I know the thoughts that I think towards you, saith
the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of affliction, to give you an
end and patience.</span></li>
<li><span>And you shall call upon me, and you shall go: and you
shall pray to me, and I will hear you.</span></li>
<li><span>You shall seek me, and shall And me: when you shall seek
me with all your heart.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will be found by you, saith the Lord: and I will
bring back your captivity, and I will gather you out of all
nations, and from all the places to which I have driven you out,
saith the Lord: and I will bring you back from the place to which I
caused you to be carried away captive.</span></li>
<li><span>Because you have said: The Lord hath raised us up
prophets in Babylon:</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord to the king that sitteth upon the
throne of David, and to all the people that dwell in this city, to
your brethren that are not gone forth with you into
captivity.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Behold I will send upon
them the sword, and the famine, and the pestilence: and I will make
them like bad figs that cannot be eaten, because they are very
bad.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will persecute them with the sword, and with
famine, and pith the pestilence: and I will give them up unto
affliction to all the kingdoms of the earth: to be a curse, and an
astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach to all the nations to
which I have driven them out:</span></li>
<li><span>Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the
Lord: which I sent to them by my servants the prophets, rising by
night, and sending: and you have not heard, saith the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Hear ye therefore the word of the Lord, all ye of the
captivity, whom I have sent out from Jerusalem to
Babylon.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel, to Achab
the son of Colias, and to Sedecias the son of Maasias, who prophesy
unto you in my name falsely: Behold I will deliver them up into the
hands of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon: and he shall kill them
before your eyes.</span></li>
<li><span>And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the
captivity of Juda, that are in Babylon, saying: The Lord make thee
like Sedecias, and like Achab, whom the king of Babylon fried in
the fire :</span></li>
<li><span>Because they have acted folly in Israel, and have
committed adultery with the wives of their friends, and have spoken
lying words in my name, which I commanded them not: I am the judge
and the witness, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And to Semeias the Nehelamite thou shalt say:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Because
thou hast sent letters in thy name to all the people that are in
Jerusalem, and to Sophonias the son of Maasias the priest, and to
all the priests, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord hath made thee priest in- stead of Joiada the
priest, that thou shouldst be ruler in the house of the Lord, over
every man that raveth and prophesieth, to put him in the stocks,
and into prison.</span></li>
<li><span>And now why hast thou not rebuked Jeremias the
Anathothite, who prophesieth to you?</span></li>
<li><span>For he hath also sent to us in Babylon, saying: It is a
long time: build ye houses, and dwell in them: and plant gardens,
and eat the fruits of them.</span></li>
<li><span>So Sophonias the priest read this letter, in the hearing
of Jeremias the prophet.</span></li>
<li><span>And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Send to all them of the captivity, saying: Thus saith the
Lord to Semeias the Nehelamite: Because Semeias hath prophesied to
you, and I sent him not: and hath caused you to trust in a lie
:</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord: behold I will visit upon
Semeias the Nehelamite, and upon his seed: he shall not have a man
to sit in the midst of this people, and he shall not see the good
that I will do to my people, saith the Lord: because he hath spoken
treason against the Lord.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">

<ol>
<li><span>This is the word that came to Jeremias from the Lord,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, saying: Write
thee all the words that I have spoken to thee, in a
book.</span></li>
<li><span>For behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will
bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Juda, saith the
Lord: and I will cause them to return to the land which I gave to
their fathers, and they shall possess it.</span></li>
<li><span>And these are the words that the Lord hath spoken to
Israel and to Juda:</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord: We have heard a voice of terror
: there is fear and no peace.</span></li>
<li><span>Ask ye, and see if a man bear children ? why then have I
seen every man with his hands on his loins, like a woman in labour,
and all faces are turned yellow?</span></li>
<li><span>Alas, for that day is great, neither is there the like to
it; and it Is the time of tribulation to Jacob, but he shall be
saved out of it.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord of
hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst
his bands: and strangers shall no more rule over him:</span></li>
<li><span>But they shall serve the Lord their God, and David their
king, whom I will raise up to them.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore fear thou not, my servant Jacob, saith the
Lord, neither be dismayed, O Israel: for behold, I will save thee
from a country afar off, and thy seed from the land of their
captivity: and Jacob shall return, and be at rest, and abound with
all good things, and there shall be none whom he may
fear:</span></li>
<li><span>For I am with thee, saith the Lord, to save thee: for I
will utterly consume all the nations, among which I have scattered
thee: but I will not utterly consume thee: but I will chastise thee
in judgment, that thou mayst not seem to thyself
innocent.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord: Thy bruise is incurable, thy
wound is very grievous.</span></li>
<li><span>There is none to judge thy judgment to bind it up : thou
hast no healing medicines.</span></li>
<li><span>All thy lovers have forgotten thee, and will not seek
after thee: for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy,
with a cruel chastisement: by reason of the multitude of thy
iniquities, thy sins are hardened.</span></li>
<li><span>Why criest thou for thy affliction? thy sorrow is
incurable: for the multitude of thy iniquity, and for thy hardened
sins I have done these things to thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured:
and all thy enemies shall be carried into captivity : and they that
waste thee shall be wasted, and all that prey upon thee will I give
for a prey.</span></li>
<li><span>For I will close up thy scar, and will heal thee of thy
wounds, saith the Lord. Because they have called thee, O Sion, an
outcast: This is she that hath none to seek after her.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: Behold I bring back the captivity of
the pavilions of Jacob, and will have pity on his houses, and the
city shall be built in her place, and the temple shall be found
according to the order thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>And out of them shall come forth praise, and the voice of
them that play: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be
made few : and I will glorify them, and they shall not be
lessened.</span></li>
<li><span>And their children shall be as from the beginning, and
their assembly be permanent before me : and I will against all that
afflict them.</span></li>
<li><span>And their leader shall be of themselves: and their prince
shall come forth from the midst of them : and I will bring him
near, and he shall come to me: for who is this that setteth his
heart to approach to me, saith the Lord?</span></li>
<li><span>And you shall be my people: and I will be your
God.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold the whirlwind of the Lord, his fury going forth, a
violent storm, it shall rest upon the head of the
wicked.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord will not turn away the wrath of his indignation,
till he have executed and performed the thought o his heart: in the
latter days you shall understand these things.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>At that time, saith the Lord, I will be the God of all
the families of and they shall be my people.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: The people were left and escaped
from the sword, found grace in the desert: Israel shall to his
rest.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord hath appeared from afar to me. Yea I have loved
thee with everlasting love, therefore have I drawn thee, taking
pity on thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will build thee again, and thou shalt be built, 0
virgin of Israel: thou shalt again be adorned with thy timbrels,
and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make
merry.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt yet plant vineyards in the mountains of
Samaria: the planters shall plant, and they shall not gather the
vintage before the time.</span></li>
<li><span>For there shall be a day, in which the watchmen on mount
Ephraim, shall cry: Arise, and let us go up to Sion to the Lord our
God.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord: Rejoice ye in the joy of Jacob,
and neigh before the head of the Gentiles: shout ye, and sing, and
say: Save, O Lord, thy people, the remnant of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I will bring them from the north country, and will
gather them from the ends of the earth: and among them shall be the
blind, and the lame, the woman with child, and she that is bringing
forth, together, a great company of them returning
hither.</span></li>
<li><span>They shall come with weeping: and I will bring them back
in mercy: and I will bring them through the torrents of waters in a
right way, and they shall not stumble in it: for I am a father to
Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.</span></li>
<li><span>Hear the word of the Lord, O ye nations, and declare it
in the islands that are afar off, and say: He that scattered Israel
will gather him: and he will keep him as the shepherd doth his
flock.</span></li>
<li><span>For the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and delivered him out
of the hand of one that was mightier than he.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall come, and shall give praise in mount Sion:
and they shall flow together to the good things of the Lord, for
the corn, and wine, and oil, and the increase of cattle and herds,
and their soul shall be as a watered garden, and they shall be
hungry no more.</span></li>
<li><span>Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, the young men
and old men together: and I will turn their mourning into joy, and
will comfort them, and make them joyful after their
sorrow.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will fill the soul of the priests with fatness: and
my people shall be filled with my good things, saith the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: A voice was heard on high of
lamentation, of mourning, and weeping, of Rachel weeping for her
children, and refusing to be comforted for them, because they are
not.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: Let thy voice cease from weeping,
and thy eyes from tears: for there is a reward for thy work, saith
the Lord: and they shall return out of the land of the
enemy.</span></li>
<li><span>And here is hope for thy last end, saith the Lord: and
the children shall return to their own borders.</span></li>
<li><span>Hearing I heard Ephraim when he went into captivity: thou
hast chastised me, and I was instructed, as a young bullock
unaccustomed to the yoke. Convert me, and I shall be converted, for
thou art the Lord my God.</span></li>
<li><span>For after thou didst convert me, I did penance: and after
thou didst shew unto me, I struck my thigh: I am confounded and
ashamed, because I have borne the reproach of my youth.</span></li>
<li><span>Surely Ephraim is an honourable son to me, surely he is a
tender child: for since I spoke of him, I will still remember him.
Therefore are my bowels troubled for him: pitying I will pity him,
saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Set thee up a watchtower, make to thee bitterness: direct
thy heart into the right way, wherein thou hast walked: return, O
virgin of Israel, return to these thy cities.</span></li>
<li><span>How long wilt thou be dissolute in deliciousness, O
wandering daughter? for the Lord hath created a new thing upon the
earth: A WOMAN SHALL COMPASS A MAN.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: As yet
shall they say this word in the land of Juda, and in the cities
thereof, when I shall bring back their captivity: The Lord bless
thee, the beauty of justice, the holy mountain.</span></li>
<li><span>And Juda and all his cities shall dwell therein together:
the husbandmen and they that drive the docks.</span></li>
<li><span>For I have inebriated the weary soul: and I have filled
every hungry soul.</span></li>
<li><span>Upon this I was as it were awaked out of a sleep, and I
saw, and my sleep was sweet to me.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold the days come, saith the Lord: and I will sow the
house of Israel and the house of Juda with the seed of men, and
with the seed of beasts.</span></li>
<li><span>And as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to
throw down, and to scatter, and destroy, and afflict: so will I
watch over them, to build up, and to plant them, saith the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>In those days they shall say no more: The fathers have
eaten a sour grape, and the teeth of the children are set on
edge.</span></li>
<li><span>But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man
that shall eat the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on
edge.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold the days shall come, saith the Lord, and I will
make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of
Juda:</span></li>
<li><span>Not according to the covenant which I made with their
fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out
of the land of Egypt: the covenant which they made void, and I had
dominion over them, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the
house of Israel, after those days, saith the Lord: I will give my
law in their bowels, and I will write it in their heart: and I will
be their God, and they shall be my people.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and
every man his brother, saying: Know the Lord: for all shall know me
from the least of them even to the greatest, saith the Lord: for I
will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no
more.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord, who giveth the sun for the light of
the day, the order of the moon and of the stars, for the light of
the night: who stirreth up the sea, and the waves thereof roar, the
Lord of hosts is his name.</span></li>
<li><span>If these ordinances shall fail before me, saith the Lord:
then also the seed of Israel shall fail, so as not to be a nation
before me for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: If the heavens above can be
measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I
also will cast away all the seed of Israel, for all that they have
done, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold the days come, saith the Lord, that the city shall
be built to the Lord from the tower of Hanameel even to the gate of
the corner.</span></li>
<li><span>And the measuring line shall go out farther in his sight
upon the hill Gareb: and it shall compass Goatha,</span></li>
<li><span>And the whole valley of dead bodies and of ashes, and all
the country of death, even to the torrent Cedron, and the corner of
the horse gate towards the east, the Holy of the Lord: it shall not
be plucked up, and it shall not be destroyed any more for
ever.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="32">Jeremias 32</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord in the tenth
year of Sedecias king of Juda: the same is eighteenth year of
Nabuchodonosor.</span></li>
<li><span>At that time the army of the king o Babylon besieged
Jerusalem: and Jeremias the prophet was shut up in the court of the
prison, which was in the house of the king of Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>For Sedecias king of Juda had shut him up, saying: Why
dost thou prophesy, saying: Thus saith the Lord: Behold I will give
this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take
it?</span></li>
<li><span>And Sedecias king of Juda shall not escape out of the
hand of the Chaldeans: but he shall be delivered into the hands of
the king of Babylon: and he shall speak to him mouth to mouth, and
his eyes shall see his eyes.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall lead Sedecias to Babylon: and he shall be
there till I visit him, saith the Lord. But if you will fight
against the Chaldeans, you shall have no success.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jeremias said: The word of the Lord came to me,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Behold, Hanameel the son of Sellum thy cousin shall come
to thee, saying: Buy thee my field, which is in Anathoth, for it is
thy right to buy it, being akin.</span></li>
<li><span>And Hanameel my uncle's son cam to me, according to the
word of the to the entry of the prison, and said me: Buy my held,
which is in in the land of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance
is thins, and thou art next of kin to possess it. And I understood
this was the word of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And I bought the held of my uncle's son, that is in
Anathoth: and I weighed him the money, seven staters, and ten
pieces of silver.</span></li>
<li><span>And I wrote it in a book and sealed it, and took
witnesses: and I weighed him the money in the balances.</span></li>
<li><span>And I took the deed of the purchase that was sealed, and
the stipulations, and the ratifications with the seals that were on
the outside.</span></li>
<li><span>And I gave the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of
Neri the son of Maasias in the sight of Hanameel my uncle's son, in
the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the
purchase, and before all the Jews that sat in the court of the
prison.</span></li>
<li><span>And I charged Baruch before them, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Take
these writings, this deed of the purchase that is sealed up, and
this deed that is open: and put them in an earthen vessel, that
they may continue many days.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel:
Houses, and fields, and vineyards shall be possessed again in this
land.</span></li>
<li><span>And after I had delivered the deed of purchase to Baruch
the son of Neri, I prayed to the Lord, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Alas, alas, alas, 0 Lord God, behold thou hast made
heaven and earth by thy great power, and thy stretched out arm: no
word shall be hard to thee:</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shewest mercy unto thousands, and returnest the
iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after
them: O most mighty, great, and powerful, the Lord of hosts is thy
name.</span></li>
<li><span>Great in counsel and incomprehensible in thought: whose
eyes are open upon all the ways of the children of Adam, to render
unto every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of
his devices.</span></li>
<li><span>Who hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt even
until this day, and in Israel, and amongst men, and hast made thee
a name as at this day.</span></li>
<li><span>And hast brought forth thy people Israel, out of the land
of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and
a stretched out arm, and with great terror.</span></li>
<li><span>And best given them this land which thou didst swear to
their fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and
honey.</span></li>
<li><span>And they came in, and possessed it: but they obeyed not
thy voice, and they walked not in thy law: and they did not any of
those things that thou didst command them to do, and all these
evils are come upon them.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold works are built up against the city to take it:
and the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans, who fight
against it, by the sword, and the famine, and the pestilence: and
what thou hast spoken, is all come to pass, as thou thyself
seest.</span></li>
<li><span>And sayest thou to me, O Lord God: Buy a field for money,
and take witnesses, whereas the city is given into the hands of the
Chaldeans?</span></li>
<li><span>And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I am the Lord the God of all flesh: shall any
thing be hard for me?</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord: Behold I will deliver this
city into the hands of the Chaldeans, and into the hands of the
king of Babylon, and they shall take it.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Chaldeans that fight against this city, shall
come and set it on fire, and burn it, with the houses upon whose
roofs they offered sacrifice to Baal, and poured out drink
offerings to strange gods, to provoke me to wrath.</span></li>
<li><span>For the children of Israel, and the children of Juda,
have continually done evil in my eyes from their youth: the
children of Israel who even till now provoke me with the work of
their hands, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>For this city hath been to me a provocation and
indignation from the day that they built it, until this day, in
which it shall be taken out of my sight.</span></li>
<li><span>Because of all the evil of the children of Israel, and of
the children of Juda, which they have done, provoking me to wrath,
they and their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their
prophets, the men of Juda, and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And they have turned their backs to me, and not their
faces: when I taught them early in the morning, and instructed
them, and they would not hearken to receive
instruction.</span></li>
<li><span>And they have set their idols in the house, in which my
name is called upon, to defile it.</span></li>
<li><span>And they have built the high places of Baal, which are in
the valley of the son of Ennom, to consecrate their sons and their
daughters to Moloch: which I commanded them not, neither entered it
into my heart, that they should do this abomination, and cause Juda
to sin.</span></li>
<li><span>And now, therefore, thus saith the Lord the God of Israel
to this city, whereof you say that it shall be delivered into the
hands of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by famine, and by
pestilence :</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I will gather them together out of all the lands
to which I have cast them out in my anger, and in my wrath, and in
my great indignation: and I will bring them again into this place,
and will cause them to dwell securely.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall be my people, and I will be their
God.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they
may fear me all days : and that it may be well with them, and with
their children after them.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, and
will not cease to do them good: and I will give my fear in their
heart, that they may not revolt from me.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will rejoice over them, when I shall do them good:
and I will plant them in this land in truth, with my whole heart,
and with all my soul.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord: As I have brought upon this
people all this great evil: so will I bring upon them all the good
that I now speak to them.</span></li>
<li><span>And fields shall be purchased in this land: whereof you
say that it is desolate, because there remaineth neither man nor
beast, and it is given into the hands of the Chaldeans.</span></li>
<li><span>Fields shall be bought for money, and deeds shall be
written, and sealed, and witnesses shall be taken, in the land of
Benjamin, and round about Jerusalem, in the cities of Juda, and in
the cities on the mountains, and in the cities of the plains, and
in the cities that are towards the south: for I will bring their
captivity, saith the Lord.</span></li>

<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="33">Jeremias 33</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias the second
time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord, who will do, and will form it, and
prepare it, the Lord is his name.</span></li>
<li><span>Cry to me and I will hear thee: and I will shew thee
great things, and sure things which thou knowest not.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord the God of Israel to the houses
of this city, and to the houses of the king of Juda, which rue
destroyed, and to the bulwarks, and to the sword.</span></li>
<li><span>Of them that come to fight with the Chaldeans, and to
fill them with the dead bodies of the men whom I have slain in my
wrath, and in my indignation, hiding my face from this city because
of all their wickedness.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I will close their wounds and give them health,
and I will cure them: and I will reveal to them the prayer of peace
and truth.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will bring back the captivity of Juda, and the
captivity of Jerusalem: and I will build them as from the
beginning.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby
they have sinned against me: and I will forgive all their
iniquities, whereby they have sinned against me, and despised
me.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall be to me a name, and a joy, and a praise,
and a gladness before all the nations of the earth, that shall hear
of all the good things which I will do to them: and they shall fear
and be troubled for all the good things, and for all the peace that
I will make for them.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: There shall be heard again in this
place (which you say is desolate, because there is neither man nor
beast: in the cities of Juda, and without Jerusalem, which are
desolate without man, and without inhabitant, and without
beast)</span></li>
<li><span>The voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of
the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that
shall say: Give ye glory to the Lord of hosts, for the Lord is
good, for his mercy endureth for ever: and of them that shall bring
their vows into the house of the Lord: for I will bring back the
captivity of the land as at the first, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: There shall be again in
this place that is desolate without man, and without beast, and in
all the cities thereof, an habitation of shepherds causing their
flocks to lie down.</span></li>
<li><span>And in the cities on the mountains, and in the cities of
the plains, and in the cities that are towards the south: and in
the land of Benjamin, and round about Jerusalem, and in the cities
of Juda shall the flocks pass again under the hand of him that
numbereth them, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold the days come, saith the Lord, that I will perform
the good word that I have spoken to the house of Israel, and to the
house of Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>In those days, and at that time, I will make the bud of
justice to spring forth unto David, and he shall do judgment and
justice in the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>In those days shall Juda be saved, and Jerusalem shall
dwell securely: and this is the name that they shall call him, The
Lord our just one.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord: There shall not be cut off from
David a man to sit upon the throne of the house of
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Neither shall there be cut off from the priests and
Levites a man before my face to offer holocausts, and to burn
sacrifices, and to kill victims continually:</span></li>
<li><span>And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: If my covenant with the day can be
made void, and my covenant with the night, that there should not be
day and night in their season:</span></li>
<li><span>Also my covenant with David my servant may be made void,
that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne, and with
the Levites and priests my ministers.</span></li>
<li><span>As the stars of heaven cannot be numbered, nor the sand
of the sea be measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my
servant, and the Levites my ministers.</span></li>
<li><span>And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Hast thou not seen what this people hath spoken, saying:
The two families which the Lord had chosen, are cast off: and they
have despised my people, so that it is no more a nation before
them?</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: If I have not set my covenant
between day and night, and laws to heaven and earth:</span></li>
<li><span>Surely I will also cast; off the seed of Jacob, and of
David my servant, so as not to take any of his seed to be rulers of
the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will bring back their
captivity, and will have mercy on them.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord, (when
Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the
kingdoms of the earth, that were under the power of his hand, and
all the people fought against Jerusalem and against all the cities
thereof,) saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel: Go, and speak to
Sedecias king of Juda, and say to him: Thus saith the Lord: Behold
I will deliver this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and
he shall burn it with fire.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt not escape out of his hand: but thou shalt
surely be taken, and thou shalt be delivered into his hand: and thy
eyes shall see the eyes of the king of Babylon, and his mouth shall
speak with thy mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.</span></li>
<li><span>Yet hear the word of the Lord, O Sedecias king of Juda:
Thus saith the Lord to thee: Thou shalt not die by the
sword.</span></li>
<li><span>But thou shalt die in peace, and according to the
burnings of thy fathers, the former kings that were before thee, so
shall they burn thee: and they shall mourn for thee, saying: Alas,
Lord: for I have spoken the word, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jeremias the prophet spoke all these words to
Sedecias the king of Juda in Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And the army of the king of Babylon fought against
Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Juda that were left,
against Lachis, and against Azecha: for these remained of the
cities of Juda, fenced cities.</span></li>
<li><span>The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord, after that
king Sedecias had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem
making a proclamation:</span></li>
<li><span>That every man should let his manservant, and every man
his maidservant, being a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, go free: and
that they should not lord it over them, to wit, over the Jews their
brethren.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the princes, and all the people who entered into
the covenant, heard that every man should let his manservant, and
every man his maidservant go free, and should no more have dominion
over them: and they obeyed, and let them go free.</span></li>
<li><span>But afterwards they turned: and brought back again their
servants and their handmaids, whom they had let go free, and
brought them into subjection as menservants and
maidservants.</span></li>
<li><span>And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias from the Lord,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: I made a covenant
with your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of
Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>At the end of seven years, let ye go every man his
brother being a Hebrew, who hath been sold to thee, so he shall
serve thee six years: and thou shalt let him go free from thee: and
your fathers did not hearken to me, nor did they incline their
ear.</span></li>
<li><span>And you turned to day, and did that which was right in my
eyes, in proclaiming liberty every one to his brother: and you made
a covenant in my sight, in the house upon which my name is
invocated.</span></li>
<li><span>And you are fallen back, and have defiled my name: and
you have brought back again every man his manservant, and every man
his maidservant, whom you had let go free, and set at liberty: and
you have brought them into subjection to be your servants and
handmaids.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord: You have not hearkened to
me, in proclaiming liberty every man to his brother and every man
to his friend: behold I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the Lord,
to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine: and I will
cause you to be removed to all the kingdoms of the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will give the men that have transgressed my
covenant, and have not performed the words of the covenant which
they agreed to in my presence, when they cut the calf in two and
passed between the parts thereof:</span></li>
<li><span>The princes of Juda, and the princes of Jerusalem, the
eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land that
passed between the parts of the calf:</span></li>
<li><span>And I will give them into the hands of their enemies, and
into the hands of them that seek their life : and their dead bodies
shall be for meat to the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And Sedecias the king of Juda, and his princes, I will
give into the hands of their enemies, and into the hands of them
that seek their lives, and into the hands of the armies of the king
of Babylon, which are gone from you.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I will command, saith the Lord, and I will bring
them again to this city, and they shall fight against it, and take
it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Juda a
desolation, without an inhabitant.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord in the days
of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Go to the house of the Rechabites: and speak to them, and
bring them into the house of the Lord, into one of the chambers of
the treasures, and thou shalt give them wine to drink.</span></li>
<li><span>And I took Jezonias the son of Jeremias the son of
Habsanias, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house
of the Rechabites.</span></li>
<li><span>And I brought them into the house of the Lord, to the
treasure house of the sons of Hanan, the son of Jegedelias the man
of God, which was by the treasure house of the princes, above the
treasure of Maasias the son of Sellum, who was keeper of the
entry.</span></li>
<li><span>And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites
pots full of wine, and cups: and I said to them: Drink ye
wine.</span></li>
<li><span>And they answered : We will not drink wine: because
Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying: You
shall drink no wine, neither you, nor your children, for
ever:</span></li>
<li><span>Neither shall ye build houses, nor sow seed, nor plant
vineyards, nor have any: but you shall dwell in tents all your
days, that you may live many days upon the face of the earth, in
which you are strangers.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of
Rechab, our father, in all things that he commanded us: so as to
drink no wine all our days: neither we, nor our wives, nor our
sons, nor our daughters:</span></li>
<li><span>Nor to build houses to dwell in, nor to have vineyard, or
field, or seed:</span></li>
<li><span>But we have dwelt in tents, and have been obedient
according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.</span></li>
<li><span>But when Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came up to our
land, we said: Come, let us go into Jerusalem from the face of the
army of the Chaldeans, and from the face of the army of Syria: and
we have remained in Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Go, and
say to the men of Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: Will
you not receive instruction, to obey my words, saith the Lord
?</span></li>
<li><span>The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, by which he
commanded his sons not to drink wine, have prevailed: and they have
drunk none to this day, because they have obeyed the commandment of
their father: but I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking,
and you have not obeyed me.</span></li>
<li><span>And I have sent to you all my servants the prophets,
rising early, and sending and saying: Return ye every man from his
wicked way, and make your ways good: and follow not strange gods,
nor worship them, and you shall dwell in the land, which I gave you
and your fathers: and you have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened
to me.</span></li>
<li><span>So the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have constantly
kept the commandment of their father, which he commanded them: but
this people hath not obeyed me.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel:
Behold I will bring upon Juda, and upon all the inhabitants of
Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them, because
I have spoken to them, and they have not heard: I have called to
them, and they have not answered me.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jeremias said to the house of the Rechabites: Thus
saith the Lord of hosts the Cod of Israel: Because you have obeyed
the commandment of Jonadab your father, and have kept all his
precepts, and have done all that he commanded you:</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord of host the God of Israel:
There shall not be wanting a man of the race of Jonadab the son of
Rechab, standing before me for ever.</span></li>

<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="36">Jeremias 36</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And it came to pass in the fourth year of Joakim the son
of Josias king of Juda, that this word came to Jeremias by the
Lord, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Take thee a roll of a book, and thou shalt write in it
all the words that I have spoken to thee against Israel and Juda,
and against all the nations from the day that I spoke to thee, from
the days of Josias even to this day.</span></li>
<li><span>If so be, when the house of Juda shall hear all the evils
that I purpose to do unto them, that they may return every man from
his wicked way: and I will forgive their iniquity, and their
sin.</span></li>
<li><span>So Jeremias called Baruch the son of Nerias: and Baruch
wrote from the mouth of Jeremias all the words of the Lord, which
he spoke to him, upon the roll of a book.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jeremias commanded Baruch, saying: I am shut up, and
cannot go into the house of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Go thou in therefore, and read out of the volume, which
thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the Lord, in the
hearing of all the people in the house of the Lord on the fasting
day: and also thou shalt read them in the hearing of all Juda that
come out of their cities:</span></li>
<li><span>If so be they may present their supplication before the
Lord, and may return every one from his wicked way: for great is
the wrath and indignation which the Lord hath pronounced against
this people.</span></li>
<li><span>And Baruch the son of Nerias did according to all that
Jeremias the prophet had commanded him, reading out of the volume
the words of the Lord in the house of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And it came to pass in the fifth year of Joakim the son
of Josias king of Juda, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a
fast before the Lord to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the
people that were come together out of the cities of Juda to
Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And Baruch read out of the volume the words of Jeremias
in the house of the Lord, in the treasury of Gamarias the son of
Saphan the scribe, in the upper court, in the entry of the new gate
of the house of the Lord, in the hearing of all the
people.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Micheas the son of Gamarias the son of Saphan
had heard out of the book all the words of the Lord,</span></li>
<li><span>He went down into the king's house to the secretary's
chamber: and behold all the princes sat there, Elisama the scribe,
and Dalaias the son of Semeias, and Elnathan the son of Achobor,
and Gamarias the son of Saphan, and Sedecias the son of Hananias,
and all the princes.</span></li>
<li><span>And Micheas told them all the words that he had heard
when Baruch read out of the volume in the hearing of the
people.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore all the princes sent Judi the son of Nathanias,
the son of Selemias, the son of Chusi, to Baruch, saying: Take in
thy hand the volume in which thou hast read in the hearing of the
people, and come. So Baruch the son of Nerias took the volume in
his hand, and came to them.</span></li>
<li><span>And they said to him: Sit down and read these things in
our hearing. And Baruch read in their hearing.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they had heard all the words, they looked upon
one another with astonishment, and they said to Baruch: We must
tell the king all these words.</span></li>
<li><span>And they asked him, saying: Tell us how didst thou write
all these words from his mouth.</span></li>
<li><span>And Baruch said to them: With his mouth he pronounced all
these words as if he were reading to me: and I wrote in a volume
with ink.</span></li>
<li><span>And the princes said to Baruch: Go, and hide thee, both
thou and Jeremias, and let no man know where you are.</span></li>
<li><span>And they went in to the king into the court: but they
laid up the volume in the chamber of Elisama the scribe: and they
told all the words in the hearing of the king.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king sent Judi that he should take the volume:
who bringing it out of the chamber of Elisama the scribe, read it
in the hearing of the king, and of all the princes that stood about
the king.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the king sat in the winter house, In the ninth month:
and there was a hearth before him full of burning
coals.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Judi had read three or four pages, he cut it
with the penknife, and he cast it into the Are, that was upon the
hearth, till all the volume was consumed with the fire that was on
the hearth.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king and all his servants that heard all these
words were not afraid, nor did they rend their
garments.</span></li>
<li><span>But yet Elnathan, and Dalaias, and Gamarias spoke to the
king, not to burn. the book: and he heard them not.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king commanded Jeremiel the son of Amelech, and
Saraias the son of Ezriel, and Selemias the son of Abdeel, to take
up Baruch the scribe, and Jeremias the prophet: but the Lord hid
them.</span></li>
<li><span>And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias the prophet,
after that the king had burnt the volume, and the words that Baruch
had written from the mouth of Jeremias, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Take thee again another volume: and write in it all the
former words that were in the first volume which Joakim the king of
Juda hath burnt.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt say to Joakim the king of Juda: Thus saith
the Lord: Thou hast burnt that volume, saying: Why hast thou
written therein, and said: The king of Babylon shall come speedily,
and shall lay waste this land: and shall cause to cease from thence
man and beast?</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord against Joakim the king of
Juda: He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his
dead body shall be cast out to the heat by day, and to the frost by
night.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will punish him, and his seed and his servants, for
their iniquities, and I will bring upon them, and upon the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Juda all the evil
that I have pronounced against them, but they have not
heard.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jeremias took another volume, and gave it to Baruch
the son of Nerias the scribe: who wrote in it from the mouth of
Jeremias all the words of the book which Joakim the king of Juda
had burnt with fire: and there were added besides many more words
than had been before.</span></li>

<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="37">Jeremias 37</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Now king Sedecias the son of Josias reigned instead of
Jechonias the son of Joakim: whom Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon
made king in the land of Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the
land did obey the words of the Lord, that he spoke in the hand of
Jeremias the prophet.</span></li>
<li><span>And king Sedecias sent Juchal the son of Selemias, and
Sophonias the son of Maasias the priest to Jeremias the prophet,
saying: Pray to the Lord our God for us.</span></li>
<li><span>Now Jeremias walked freely in the midst of the people r
for they had not as yet cast him into prison. And the army of
Pharao was come out of Egypt: and the Chaldeans that besieged
Jerusalem, hearing these tidings, departed from
Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias the prophet,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Thus shall you say
to the king of Juda, who sent you to inquire of me: Behold the army
of Pharao, which is come forth to help you, shall return into their
own land, into Egypt.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against
this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: Deceive not your souls, saying: The
Chaldeans shall surely depart and go away from us: for they shall
not go away;</span></li>
<li><span>But if you should even beat al: the army of the Chaldeans
that fight against you, and there should be left of them some
wounded men: they shall rise up, every man from his tent, and burn
this city with Are.</span></li>
<li><span>Now when the army of the Chaldeans was gone away from
Jerusalem, because of Pharao's army,</span></li>
<li><span>Jeremias went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land
of Benjamin: and to divide a possession there in the presence of
the citizens.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he was come to the gate of Benjamin, the captain
of the gate, who I was there in his turn, was one named Jerias, the
son of Selemias, the son of Hananias: and he took hold of Jeremias
the prophet, saying: Thou art fleeing to the Chaldeans.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jeremias answered: It is not so, I am not fleeing to
the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Jerias took Jeremias
and brought him to the princes.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore the princes were angry with Jeremias, and they
beat him, and cast him into the prison that was in the house of
Jonathan the scribe: for he was chief over the prison.</span></li>
<li><span>So Jeremias went into the house of the prison, and into
the dungeon: and Jeremias remained there many days.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Sedecias the king, sending, took him: and asked him
secretly in his house, and said: Is there, thinkest thou, any word
from the Lord? And Jeremias said: There is. And he said: Thou shalt
be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jeremias said to king Sedecias: In what have I
offended against thee, or thy servants, or thy people, that thou
hast cast me into prison?</span></li>
<li><span>Where are your prophets that prophesied to you, and said:
The king of Babylon shall not come against you, and against this
land?</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore hear, I beseech thee, my lord the king: let
my petition be accepted in thy sight: and send me not back into the
house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.</span></li>
<li><span>Then king Sedecias commanded that Jeremias should be
committed into the entry of the prison: and that they should give
him daily a piece of bread, beside broth, till all the bread in the
city were spent: and Jeremias remained in the entry of the
prison.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="38">Jeremias 38</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Now Saphatias the son of Mathan, and Gedelias the son of
Phassur, and Juchal the son of Selemias, and Phassur the son of
Melchias heard the words that Jeremias spoke to all the people,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: Whosoever shell remain in this city,
shall die by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence : but he
that shall go forth to the Chaldeans, shall live, and his life
shall be safe, and he shall live.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: This city shall surely be delivered
into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he shall take
it.</span></li>
<li><span>And the princes said to the king: We beseech thee that
this man may be put to death: for on purpose he weakeneth the hands
of the men of war, that remain in this city, and the hands of the
people, speaking to them according to these words: for this man
seeketh not peace to this people, but evil.</span></li>
<li><span>And king Sedecias said: Behold he is in your hands: for
it is not lawful for the king to deny you any thing.</span></li>
<li><span>Then they took Jeremias and cast him into the dungeon of
Melchias the son of Amelech, which was in the entry of the prison:
and they let down Jeremias by ropes into the dungeon, wherein there
was no water, but mire. And Jeremias sunk into the
mire.</span></li>
<li><span>Now Abdemelech the Ethiopian, an eunuch that was in the
king's house, heard that they had put Jeremias in the dungeon: but
the king was sitting in the gate of Benjamin.</span></li>
<li><span>And Abdemelech went out of the king's house, and spoke to
the king, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that
they have done against Jeremias the prophet, casting him into the
dungeon to die there with hunger, for there is no more bread in the
city.</span></li>
<li><span>Then the king commanded Abdemelech the Ethiopian, saying:
Take from hence thirty men with thee, end draw up Jeremias the
prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.</span></li>
<li><span>So Abdemelech taking the men with him, went into the
king's house that was under the storehouse: and he took from thence
old rags, and old rotten things, and he let them down by cords to
Jeremias into the dungeon.</span></li>
<li><span>And Abdemelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremias: Put these
old rags and these rent and rotten things under thy arms, and upon
the cords: and Jeremias did so.</span></li>
<li><span>And they drew up Jeremias with the cords, and brought him
forth out of the dungeon. And Jeremias remained in the entry of the
prison.</span></li>
<li><span>And king Sedecias sent, and took Jeremias the prophet to
him to the third gate, that was in the house of the Lord: and the
king said to Jeremias: I will ask thee a thing, hide nothing from
me.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Jeremias said to Sedecias: If I shall declare it to
thee, wilt thou not put me to death? and if I give thee counsel,
thou wilt not hearken to me.</span></li>
<li><span>Then king Sedecias swore to Jeremias, in private, saying:
As the Lord liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to
death, nor will I deliver thee into the hands of these men that
seek thy life.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jeremias said to Sedecias: Thus saith the Lord of
hosts the God of Israel: If thou wilt take a resolution and go out
to the princes of the king of Babylon, thy soul shall live, and
this city shall not be burnt with fire: and thou shalt be safe, and
thy house.</span></li>
<li><span>But if thou wilt not go out to the princes of the king of
Babylon, this city shall be delivered into the hands of the
Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire: and thou shalt not
escape out of their hands.</span></li>
<li><span>And king Sedecias said to Jeremias: I am afraid because
of the Jews that are fled over to the Chaldeans: lest I should be
delivered into their hands, and they should abuse me.</span></li>
<li><span>But Jeremias answered: They shall not deliver thee:
hearken, I beseech thee, to the word of the Lord, which I speak to
thee, and it shall be well with thee, and thy soul shall
live.</span></li>
<li><span>But if thou wilt not go forth, this is the word which the
Lord hath shewn me:</span></li>
<li><span>Behold all the women that are left in the house of the
king of Juda, shall be brought out to the princes of the king of
Babylon: and they shall say: Thy men of peace have deceived thee,
and have prevailed against thee, they have plunged thy feet in the
mire, and in a slippery place, and they have departed from
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And all thy wives, and thy children shall be brought out
to the Chaldeans, and thou shalt not escape their hands, but thou
shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and he shall
burn this city with fire.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Sedecias said to Jeremias: Let no man know these
words, and thou shalt not die.</span></li>
<li><span>But if the princes shall hear that I have spoken with
thee, and shall come to thee, and say to thee: Tell us what thou
hast said to the king, hide it not from us, and we will not kill
thee: and also what the king said to thee:</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt say to them: I presented my supplication
before the king, that he would not command me to be carried back
into the house of Jonathan, to die there.</span></li>
<li><span>So all the princes came to Jeremias, and asked him: and
he spoke to them according to all the words that the king had
commanded him: and they left him: for nothing had been
heard.</span></li>
<li><span>But Jeremias remained in the entry of the prison, until
the day that Jerusalem was taken: and it came to pass that
Jerusalem was taken.</span></li>

<li><span>In the ninth year of Sedecias king of Juda, in the tenth
month, came Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and all his army to
Jerusalem, and they besieged it.</span></li>
<li><span>And in the I eleventh year of Sedecias, in the fourth
month, the fifth day of the month, the city was opened.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and
sat in the middle gate: Neregel, Sereser, Semegarnabu, Sarsachim,
Rabsares, Neregel, Serezer, Rebmag, and all the rest of the princes
of the king of Babylon.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Sedecias the king of Juda and all the men of war
saw them, they fled: and they went forth in the night out of the
city by the way of the king's garden, and by the gate that was
between the two walls, and they went; out to the way of the
desert.</span></li>
<li><span>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them: and
they took Sedecias in the plain of the desert of Jericho, and when
they had taken him, they brought him to Nabuchodonosor king of
Babylon to Reblatha, which is in the land of Emath: and he gave
judgment upon him.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Sedecias, in
Reblatha, before his eyes: and the king of Babylon slew all the
nobles of Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>He also put out the eyes of Sedecias: and bound him with
fetters, to be carried to Babylon.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Chaldeans burnt the king's house, and the houses
of the people with fire, and they threw down the wall of
Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And Nabuzardan the general of the army carried away
captive to Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the
city, and the fugitives that had gone over to him, and the rest of
the people that remained.</span></li>
<li><span>But Nabuzardan the general left some of the poor people
that had nothing at all, in the land of Juda, and he gave them
vineyards, and cisterns at that time.</span></li>
<li><span>Now Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had given charge to
Nabuzardan the general concerning Jeremias, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Take him, and set thy eyes upon him, and do him no harm:
but as he hath a mind, so do with him.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore Nabuzardan the general sent, and Nabusezban,
and Rabsares, and Neregel, and Sereser, and Rebmag, and all the
nobles of the king of Babylon,</span></li>
<li><span>Sent, and took Jeremias out of the court of the prison,
and committed him to Codolias the son of Ahicam the son of Saphan,
that he might go home, and dwell among the people.</span></li>
<li><span>But the word of the Lord came to Jeremias, when he was
yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying: Go, and tell
Abdemelech the Ethiopian, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Behold I
will bring my words upon this city unto evil, and not unto good:
and they shall be accomplished in thy sight in that
day.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will deliver thee in that day, saith the Lord: and
thou shalt not be given into the hands of the men whom thou
fearest:</span></li>
<li><span>But delivering, I will deliver thee, and thou shalt not
fall by the sword : but thy life shall be saved for thee, because
thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the Lord.</span></li>

<li><span>The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord, after that
Nabuzardan the general had let him go from Rama, when he had taken
him, being bound with chains, among all them that were carried away
from Jerusalem and Juda, and were carried to Babylon.</span></li>
<li><span>And the general of the army taking Jeremias, said to him:
The Lord thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this
place,</span></li>
<li><span>And he hath brought it : and the Lord hath done as he
hath said: because you have sinned against the Lord, and have not
hearkened to his voice, and this word is come upon you.</span></li>
<li><span>Now then behold I have loosed thee this day from the
chains which were upon thy hands: if it please thee to come with me
to Babylon, come : and I will set my eyes upon thee: but if it do
not please thee to come with me to Babylon, stay here: behold all
the land is before thee, as thou shalt choose, and whither it shall
please thee to go, thither go.</span></li>
<li><span>And come not with me: but dwell with Godolias the son of
Ahicam the son of Saphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made
governor over the cities of Juda: dwell therefore with him in the
midst of the people: or whithersoever it shall please thee to go,
go. And the general of the army gave him victuals and presents, and
let him go.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jeremias went to Godolias the son of Ahicam to
Masphath: and dwelt with him in the midst of the people that were
left in the land.</span></li>
<li><span>And when all the captains of the army that were scattered
through the countries, they and their companions, had heard that
the king of Babylon had made Godolias the son of Ahicam governor of
the country, and that he had committed unto him men and women, and
children, and of the poor of the land, them that had not been
carried away captive to Babylon:</span></li>
<li><span>They came to Godolias to Masphath: and Ismahel the son of
Nathanias, and Johanan, and Jonathan, the sons of Caree, and Sareas
the son of Thanehumeth, and the children of Ophi, that were of
Netophathi, and Jezonias the son of Maachati, they and their
men.</span></li>
<li><span>And Godolias the son of Ahicam the son of Saphan swore to
them and to their companions, saying: Fear not to serve the
Chaldeass: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it
shall be well with you.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I dwell in Masphath, that I may answer the
commandment of the Chaldeans that are sent to us: but as for you,
gather ye the vintage, and the harvest, and the oil, and lay it up
in your vessels, and abide in your cities which you
hold.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the
children of Ammon, and in Edom, and in all the countries, when they
heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judea, and
that he had made Godolias the son of Ahicam the son of Saphan ruler
over them:</span></li>
<li><span>All the Jews, I say, returned out of all the places to
which they had fled, and they came into the land of Juda to
Godolias to Masphath: and they gathered wine, and a very great
harvest.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Johanan the son of Caree, and all the captains of
the army, that had been scattered about in the countries, came to
Godolias to Masphath.</span></li>
<li><span>And they said to him: Know that Baalis the king of the
children of Ammon hath sent Ismahel the son of Nathanias to kill
thee. And Godolias the son of Ahicam believed them not.</span></li>
<li><span>But Johanan the son of Caree, spoke to Oodolias privately
in Masphath, saying: I will go, and I will kill Ismahel the son of
Nathanias, and no man shall know it, lest he kill thee, and all the
Jews be scattered, that are gathered unto thee, and the remnant of
Juda perish.</span></li>
<li><span>And Codolias the son of Ahicam said to Johanan the son of
Cares: Do not this thing: for what thou sayst of Ismahel is
false.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="41">Jeremias 41</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ismahel
the son of Nathanias, the son of Elisama of the royal blood, and
the nobles of the king, and ten men with him, came to Godolias the
son of Ahicam into Masphath: and they ate bread there together in
Masphath.</span></li>
<li><span>And Ismahel the son of Nathanias arose, and the ten men
that were with him, and they struck Godolias the son of Ahicam, the
son of Saphan with the sword, and slew him whom the king of Babylon
had made governor over the land.</span></li>
<li><span>Ismahel slew also all the Jews that were with Godolias in
Masphath, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the
soldiers.</span></li>
<li><span>And on the second day after he had killed Godolias, no
man yet knowing it,</span></li>
<li><span>There came some from Sichem, and from Silo, and from
Samaria, fourscore men, with their beards shaven, and their clothes
rent, and mourning: and they had offerings and incense in their
hand, to offer in the house of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And Ismahel the son of Nathanias went forth from Masphath
to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and when he had met
them, he said to them: Come to Godolias, the son of
Ahicam.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they were come to the midst of the city, Ismahel
the son of Nathanias, slew them, and cast them into the midst of
the pit, he and the men that were with him.</span></li>
<li><span>But ten men were found among them, that said to Ismahel :
Kill us not: for we have stores in the field, of wheat, and barley,
and oil, and honey. And he forbore, and slew them not with their
brethren.</span></li>
<li><span>And the pit into which Ismahel cast all the dead bodies
of the men whom he slew because of Godolias, is the same that king
Asa made, for fear of Baasa the king of Israel: the same did
Ismahel the son of Nathanias fill with them that were
slain.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Ismahel carried away captive all the remnant of the
people that were in Masphath : the king's daughters, and all the
people that remained in Masphath: whom Nabuzardan the general of
the army had committed to Godolias the son of Ahicam. And Ismahel
the son of Nathanias took them, and he departed, to go over to the
children of Ammon.</span></li>
<li><span>But Johanan the son of Caree, and all the captains of the
fighting men that were with him, heard of the evil that Ismahel the
son of Nathanias had done.</span></li>
<li><span>And taking all the men, they went out to fight against
Ismahel the son of Nathanias, and they found him by the great
waters that are in Gabaon.</span></li>
<li><span>And when all the people that were with Ismahel, had seen
Johanan the son of Caree, and all the captains of the fighting men
that were with him, they rejoiced.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the people whom Ismahel had taken, went back to
Masphath: and they returned and went to Johanan the son of
Caree.</span></li>
<li><span>But Ismahel the son of Nathanias fled with eight men,
from the face of Johanan, and went to the children of
Ammon.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Johanan the son of Caree, and all the captains of
the soldiers that were with him, took all the remnant of the people
whom they had recovered from Ismahel the son of Nathanias, from
Masphath, after that he had slain Godolias the son of Ahicam:
valiant men for war, and the women, and the children, and the
eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gabaon:</span></li>
<li><span>And they departed, and sat as sojourners in Chamaam,
which is near Bethlehem: in order to go forward, and enter into
Egypt,</span></li>
<li><span>From the face of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of
them, because Ismahel the son of Nathanias had slain Godolias the
son of Ahicam, whom the king of Babylon had made governor in the
land of Juda.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>Then all the captains of the warriors, and Johanan the
son of Caree, and Jezonias the son of Osaias, and the rest of the
people from the least to the greatest came near:</span></li>
<li><span>And they said to Jeremias the prophet: Let our
supplication fall before thee: and pray thou for us to the Lord thy
God for all this remnant, for we are left but a few of many, as thy
eyes do behold us.</span></li>
<li><span>And let the Lord thy God shew us the way by which we may
walk, and the thing that we must do.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jeremias the prophet said to them: I have heard you:
behold I will pray to the Lord your God according to your words:
and whatsoever thing he shall answer me, I will declare it to you:
and I will hide nothing from you.</span></li>
<li><span>And they said to Jeremias: The Lord be witness between us
of truth and faithfulness, if we do not according to every thing
for which the Lord thy God shall send thee to us.</span></li>
<li><span>Whether it be good or evil, we will obey the voice of the
Lord our God, to whom me send thee: that it may be well with us
when we shall hearken to the voice of the Lord our God.</span></li>
<li><span>Now after ten days, the word of the Lord came to
Jeremias.</span></li>
<li><span>And he called Johanan the son of Caree, and all the
captains of the fighting men that were with him, and all the people
from the least to the greatest.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to them: Thus saith the Lord the God of
Israel, to whom you sent me, to present your supplications before
him:</span></li>
<li><span>If you will be quiet and remain in this land, I will
build you up, and not pull you down: I will plane you, and not
pluck you up: for now I am appeased for the evil that I have done
to you.</span></li>
<li><span>Fear not because of the king of Babylon, of whom you are
greatly afraid: fear him not, saith the Lord: for I am with you, to
save you, and to deliver you from his hand.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will shew mercies to you, and will take pity on
you, and will cause you to dwell in your own land.</span></li>
<li><span>But if you say: We will not dwell in this land, neither
will we hearken to the voice of the Lord our God,</span></li>
<li><span>Saying: No, but we will go into the land of Egypt: where
we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor suffer
hunger: and there we will dwell.</span></li>
<li><span>For this now hear the word of the Lord, ye remnant of
Juda: Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: If you set
your faces to go into Egypt, and enter in to dwell
there:</span></li>
<li><span>The sword which you fear, shall overtake you there in the
land of Egypt: and the famine, whereof you are afraid, shall cleave
to you in Egypt, and there you shall die.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt, to
dwell there, shall die by the sword, and by famine, and by
pestilence: none of them shall remain, nor escape from the face of
the evil that I will bring upon them.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: As
my anger and my indignation hath been kindled against the
inhabitants of Jerusalem: so shall my indignation be kindled
against you, when you shall enter into Egypt, and you shall be an
execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach: and
you shall see this place no more.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the word of the Lord concerning you, O ye remnant
of Juda: Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have adjured
you this day.</span></li>
<li><span>For you have deceived your own souls: for you sent me to
the Lord our God, saying: Pray for us to the Lord our God, and
according to all that the Lord our God shall say to thee, so
declare unto us, and we will do it.</span></li>
<li><span>And now I have declared it to you this day, and ;you have
not obeyed the voice of the Lord your God, with regard to all the
things for which he hath sent me to you.</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore know certainly that you shall die by the
sword, and by famine, and by pestilence in the place to which you
desire to go to dwell there.</span></li>

<li><span>And it came to pass, that when Jeremias had made an end

words:</span></li>
<li><span>Azarias the son of Osaias, and Johanan the son of Caree,
and all the proud men, made answer, saying to Jeremias: Thou
tellest a lie: the Lord our God hath not sent thee, saying: Go not
into Egypt, to dwell there.</span></li>
<li><span>But Baruch the son of Nerias setteth thee on against us,
to deliver us into the hands of the Chaldeans, to kill us, and to
cause us to be carried away captives to Babylon.</span></li>
<li><span>So Johanan the son of Caree, and all the captains of the
soldiers, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the Lord, to
remain in the land of Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>But Johanan the son of Caree, and all the captains of the
soldiers took all the remnant of Juda, that were returned out of
all nations, to which they had before been scattered, to dwell in
the land of Juda:</span></li>
<li><span>Men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters,
and every soul, which Nabuzardan the general had left with Godolias
the son of Ahicam the son of Saphan, and Jeremias the prophet, and
Baruch the son of Nerias.</span></li>
<li><span>And they went Into the land of Egypt, for they obeyed not

<li><span>And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias in Taphnis,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Take great stones in thy hand, and thou shalt hide them
in the vault that is under the brick wall at the gate of Pharao's
house in Taphnis: in the sight of the men of Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord of hosts

king of Babylon my servant: and I will set his throne over these
stones which I have hid, and he shall set his throne over
them.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall come and strike the land of Egypt: such as
are for death, to death: and such as are for captivity, to
captivity: and such as are for the sword, to the sword.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall kindle a fire in the temples of the gods of
Egypt, and he shall burn them, and he shall carry them away
captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a
shepherd putteth on his garment: and he shall go forth from thence
in peace.</span></li>

that are in the land of Egypt; and the temples of the gods of Egypt
he shall burn with fire.</span></li>

<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="44">Jeremias 44</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>The word that came to Jeremias, concerning all the Jews
that dwelt in the land of Egypt, dwelling in Magdal, and in
Taphnis, and in Memphis, and in the land of Phatures,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: You have
seen all this evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all
the cities of Juda: and behold they are desolate this day, and
there is not an inhabitant in them:</span></li>
<li><span>Because of the wickedness which they have committed, to
provoke me to wrath, and to go and offer sacrifice, and worship
other gods, which neither they, nor you, nor your fathers
knew.</span></li>
<li><span>And I sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising
early, and sending, and saying: Do not commit this abominable
thing, which I hate.</span></li>
<li><span>But they heard not, nor inclined their ear to turn from
their evil ways, and not to sacrifice to strange gods.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore my indignation and my fury was poured forth,
and was kindled in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of
Jerusalem: and they are turned to desolation and waste, as at this
day.</span></li>
<li><span>And now thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel:
Why do you commit this great evil against your own souls, that
there should die of you man and woman, child and suckling out of
the midst of Juda, and no remnant should be left you:</span></li>
<li><span>In that you provoke me to wrath with the works of your
hands, by sacrificing to other gods in the land of Egypt, into
which you are come to dwell there: and that you should perish, and
be a curse, and a reproach to all the nations of the
earth?</span></li>
<li><span>Have you forgotten the evils of your fathers, and the
evils of the kings of Juda, and the evils of their wives, and your
evils, and the evils of your wives, that they have done in the land
of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem?</span></li>
<li><span>They are not cleansed even to this day: neither have they
feared, nor walked in the law of the Lord, nor in my commandments,
which I set before you and your fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel:
Behold I will set my face upon you for evil: and I will destroy all
Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will take the remnant of Juda that have set their
faces to go into the land of Egypt, and to dwell there: and they
shall be all consumed in the land of Egypt: they shall fall by the
sword, and by the famine: and they shall be consumed from the least
even to the greatest, by the sword, and by the famine shall they
die: and they shall be for an execration, and for a wonder, and for
a curse, and for a reproach.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will visit them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as
I have visited Jerusalem by the sword, and by famine, and by
pestilence.</span></li>
<li><span>And there shall be none that shall escape, and remain of
the remnant of the Jews that are gone to sojourn in the land of
Egypt: and that shall return into the land of Juda, to which they
have a desire to return to dwell there: there shall none return but
they that shall flee.</span></li>
<li><span>Then all the men that knew that their wives sacrificed to
other gods: and all the women of whom there stood by a great
multitude, and all the people of them that dwelt in the land of
Egypt in Phatures, answered Jeremias, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>As for the word which thou hast spoken to us in the name
of the Lord, we will not hearken to thee:</span></li>
<li><span>But we will certainly do every word that shall proceed
out of our own mouth, to sacrifice to the queen of heaven, and to
pour out drink offerings to her, as we and our fathers have done,
our kings, and our princes in the cities of Juda, and in the
streets of Jerusalem: and we were filled with bread, and it was
well with us, and we saw no evil.</span></li>
<li><span>But since we left off to offer sacrifice to the queen of
heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her, we have wanted all
things, and have been consumed by the sword, and by
famine.</span></li>
<li><span>And if we offer sacrifice to the queen of heaven, and
pour out drink offerings to her: did we make cakes to worship her,
to pour out drink offerings to her, without our
husbands?</span></li>
<li><span>And Jeremias spoke to all the people, to the men, and to
the women, and to all the people which had given him that answer,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Was it not the sacrifice that you offered in the cities
of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and Sour fathers,
your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, which the
Lord hath remembered, and hath it not entered into his
heart?</span></li>
<li><span>So that the Lord could no longer bear, because of the
evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which you have
committed: therefore your land is become a desolation, and an
astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this
day.</span></li>
<li><span>Because you have sacrificed to idols, and have sinned
against the Lord: and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord, and
have not walked in his law, and in his commandments, and in his
testimonies: therefore are these evils come upon you, as at this
day.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jeremias said to all the people, and to all the women
: Hear ye the word of the Lord, all Juda, you that dwell in the
land of Egypt:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel, saying:
You and your wives have spoken with your mouth, and fulfilled with
your hands, saying: Let us perform our vows which we have made, to
offer sacrifice to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink
offerings to her: you have fulfilled your vows, and have performed
them indeed.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore hear ye the word of the Lord, all Juda, you
that dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold I have sworn by my great
name, saith the Lord: that my name shall no more be named in the
mouth of any man of Juda, in the land of Egypt, saying: The Lord
God liveth.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I will watch over them for evil, and not for good:
and all the men of Juda that are in the land of Egypt, shall be
consumed, by the sword, and by famine, till there be an end of
them.</span></li>
<li><span>And a few men that shall flee from the sword, shall
return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Juda: and all the
remnant of Juda that are gone into the land of Egypt to dwell
there, shall know whose word shall stand, mine, or
theirs.</span></li>
<li><span>And this shall be a sign to you, saith the Lord, that I
will punish you in this place: that you may know that my words
shall be accomplished indeed against you for evil.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: Behold I will deliver Pharao Ephree
king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of
them that seek his life: as I delivered Sedecias king of Juda into
the hand of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon his enemy, and that
sought his life.</span></li>

<li><span>Prepare ye the shield and buckler, and go forth to

<li><span>Harness the horses, and get up, ye horsemen: stand forth
with helmets, furbish the spears, put on coats of mail.</span></li>
<li><span>What then? I have seen them dismayed, and turning their
backs, their valiant ones slain: they fled apace, and they looked
not back: terror was round about, saith the Lord.</span></li>

<li><span>Moab hath been fruitful from his youth, and hath rested
upon his lees: and hath not been poured out from vessel to vessel,
nor hath gone into captivity : therefore his taste hath remained in
him, and his scent is not changed.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I
will send him men that shall order and overturn his bottles, and
they shall cast him down, and shall empty his vessels, and break
their bottles one against another.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moab shall be ashamed of Chamos, as the house of
Israel was ashamed of Bethel, in which they trusted.</span></li>
<li><span>How do you say: We are valiant, and stout men in
battle?</span></li>
<li><span>Moab is laid waste, and they have cast down her cities:
and her choice young men are gone down to the slaughter: saith the
king, whose name is the Lord of hosts.</span></li>
<li><span>The destruction of Moab is near to come: the calamity
thereof shall come on exceeding swiftly.</span></li>
<li><span>Comfort him, all you that are round about him, and all
you that know his name, say: How is the strong staff broken, the
beautiful rod?</span></li>
<li><span>Come down from thy glory, and sit in thirst, O dwelling
of the daughter of Dibon: because the spoiler of Moab is come up to
thee, he hath destroyed thy bulwarks.</span></li>
<li><span>Stand in the way, and look out, O habitation of Aroer:
inquire of him that fleeth: and say to him that hath escaped: What
Is done?</span></li>
<li><span>Moab is confounded, because he is overthrown: howl ye,
and cry, tell ye it in Amen, that Moab is wasted.</span></li>
<li><span>And judgment is come upon the plain country: upon Helon,
and upon Jasa, and upon Mephaath.</span></li>
<li><span>And upon Dibon, and upon Nabo, and upon the house of
Deblathaim,</span></li>
<li><span>And upon Cariathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon
Bethmaon,</span></li>
<li><span>And upon Carioth, and upon Bosra: and upon all the cities
of the land of Moab, far or near.</span></li>
<li><span>The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith
the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Make him drunk, because he lifted up himself against the
Lord: and Moab shall dash his hand in his own vomit, and he also
shall be in derision.</span></li>
<li><span>For Israel hath been a derision unto thee: as though thou
hadst found him amongst thieves: for thy words therefore, which
thou hast spoken against him, thou shalt be led away
captive.</span></li>
<li><span>Leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, you that dwell
in Moab: and be ye Iike the dove that maketh her nest in the mouth
of the hole in the highest place.</span></li>
<li><span>We have heard the pride of Moab, he is exceeding proud:
his haughtiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the
loftiness of his heart.</span></li>
<li><span>I know, saith the Lord, his boasting, and that the
strength thereof is not according to it, neither hath it
endeavoured to do according as it was able.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore will I lament for Moab, and I will cry out to
all Moab, for the men of the brick wall that mourn.</span></li>
<li><span>O vineyard of Sabama, I will weep for thee, with the
mourning of Jazer: thy branches are gone over the sea, they are
come even to the sea of Jazer: the robber hath rushed in upon thy
harvest and thy vintage.</span></li>
<li><span>Joy and gladness is taken away from Carmel, and from the
land of Moab, and I have taken away the wine out of the presses:
the treader of the grapes shall not sing the accustomed cheerful
tune.</span></li>
<li><span>From the cry of Hesebon even to Eleale, and to Jasa, they
have uttered their voice: from Segor to Oronaim, as a heifer of
three years old: the waters also of Nemrim shall be very
bad.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will take away from Moab, saith the Lord, him that
offereth in the high places, and that sacrificeth to his
gods.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore my heart shall sound for Moab like pipes: and
my heart a sound like pipes for the men of the brick wall: because
he hath done more than he could, therefore they have
perished.</span></li>
<li><span>For every head shall be bald, and every beard shall be
shaven: all hands shall be tied together, and upon every back there
shall be haircloth.</span></li>
<li><span>Upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets
thereof general mourning: because I have broken Moab as an useless
vessel, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>How is it overthrown, and they have howled! How hath Moab
bowed down the neck, and is confounded ! And Moab shall be a
derision, and an example to all round about him.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: Behold he shall fly as an eagle, and
shall stretch forth his wings to Moab.</span></li>
<li><span>Carioth is taken, and the strong holds are won: and the
heart of the valiant men of Moab in that day shall be as the heart
of a woman in labour.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moab shall cease to be a people : because he hath
gloried against the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Fear, and the pit, and the snare come upon thee, O
inhabitant of Moab, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>He that shall flee from the fear, shall fall into the
pit: and he that shall get up out of the pit, shall be taken in the
snare: for I will bring upon Moab the year of their visitation,
saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>They that fled from the snare stood in the shadow of
Hesebon: but there came a fire out of Kesebon, and a flame out of
the midst of Seen, and it shall devour part of Moab. and the crown
of the head of the children of tumult.</span></li>
<li><span>Woe to thee, Moab, thou hast perished, O people of
Chamos: for thy sons, and thy daughters are taken
captives.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will bring back the captivity of Moab in the last
days, saith the Lord. Hitherto the judgments of Moab.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>Against the children of Ammon. Thus saith the Lord: Hath
Israel no sons? or hath he no heir? Why then hath Melchom inherited
Gad: and his people dwelt in his cities ?</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I
will cause the noise of war to be heard in Rabbath of the children
of Ammon, and it shall be destroyed into a heap, and her daughters
shall be burnt with fire, and Israel shall possess them that have
possessed him, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Howl, O Hesebon, for Hai is wasted. Cry, ye daughters of
Rabbath, gird yourselves with haircloth: mourn and go about by the
hedges: for Melchom shall be carried into captivity, his priests,
and his princes together.</span></li>
<li><span>Why gloriest thou in the valleys? thy valley hath flowed
away, O delicate daughter, that hast trusted in thy treasures, and
hast said: Who shall come to me?</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord God
of hosts, from all that are round about thee: and you shall be
scattered every one out of one another's sight, neither shall there
be any to gather together them that flee.</span></li>
<li><span>And afterwards I will cause the captives of the children
of Ammon to return, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Against Edom. Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Is wisdom no
more in Theman? counsel is perished from her children: their wisdom
is become unprofitable.</span></li>
<li><span>Flee and turn your backs, go down into the deep hole, ye
inhabitants of Dedan: for I have brought the destruction of Esau
upon him, the time of his visitation.</span></li>
<li><span>If grapegatherers had come to thee, would they not have
left a bunch? if thieves in the night, they would have taken what
was enough for them.</span></li>
<li><span>But I have made Esau bare, I have revealed his secrets,
and he cannot be hid: his seed is laid waste, and his brethren, and
his neighbours, and he shall not be.</span></li>
<li><span>Leave thy fatherless children: I will make them live: and
thy widows shall hope in me.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord: Behold they whose judgment was
not to drink of the cup, shall certainly drink: and shalt thou come
off as innocent? thou shalt not come off as innocent, but drinking
thou shalt drink.</span></li>
<li><span>For I have sworn by myself, saith the Lord, that Bosra
shall become a desolation, and a reproach, and a desert, and a
curse: and all her cities shall be everlasting wastes.</span></li>
<li><span>I have heard a rumour from the Lord, and an ambassador is
sent to the nations: Gather yourselves together, and come against
her, and let us rise up to battle.</span></li>
<li><span>For behold I have made thee a little one among the
nations, despicable among men.</span></li>
<li><span>Thy arrogancy hath deceived thee, and the pride of thy
heart: O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, and
endeavourest to lay hold on the height of the hill : but though
thou shouldst make thy nest as high as an eagle, I will bring thee
down from thence, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And Edom shall be desolate: every one that shall pass by
it, shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all its
plagues.</span></li>
<li><span>As Sodom was overthrown and Gomorrha, and the neighbours
thereof, saith the Lord: there shall not a man dwell there, and
there shall no son of man inhabit it.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold one shall come up as a lion from the swelling of
the Jordan, against the strong and beautiful: for I will make him
run suddenly upon her: and who shall be the chosen one whom I may
appoint over her? for who is like to m? and who shall abide me? and
who is that shepherd that can withstand my countenance?</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore hear ye the counsel of the Lord, which he hath
taken concerning Edom: and his thoughts which he hath thought
concerning the inhabitants of Theman: surely the little ones of the
flock shall cast them down, of a truth they shall destroy them with
their habitation.</span></li>
<li><span>The earth is moved at the noise of their fall: the cry of
their voice is heard in the Red Sea.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold he shall come up as an eagle, and fly: and he
shall spread his wings over Bosra: and in that day the heart of the
valiant ones of Edom shall be as the heart of a woman in
labour.</span></li>
<li><span>Against Damascus. Emath is confounded and Arphad: for
they have heard very bad tidings, they are troubled as in the sea:
through care they could not rest.</span></li>
<li><span>Damascus is undone, she is put to flight, trembling hath
seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her as a woman in
labour.</span></li>
<li><span>How have they forsaken the city of renown, the city of
joy !</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets: and
all the men of war shall be silent in that day, saith the Lord of
hosts.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, rind it
shall devour the strong holds of Benadad.</span></li>
<li><span>Against Cedar and against the kingdoms of Asor, which
Nabuchodonouor king of Babylon destroyed. Thus saith the Lord:
Arise, and go ye up to Cedar, and waste the children of the
east.</span></li>
<li><span>They shall take their tents, and their flocks: and shall
carry off for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and
their camels: and they shall call fear upon them round
about.</span></li>
<li><span>Flee ye, get away speedily, sit in deep holes, you that
inhabit Asur, saith the Lord: for Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon
hath taken counsel against you, and hath conceived designs against
you.</span></li>
<li><span>Arise, and so up to a nation that is at ease, and that
dwelleth securely, saith the Lord: they have neither gates, nor
bars: they dwell alone.</span></li>
<li><span>And their camels shall be for a spoil, and the multitude
of their cattle for a booty, and I will scatter into every wind
them that have their hair cut round, and I will bring destruction
upon them from I all their confines, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And Asor shall be a habitation for dragons, desolate for
ever: no man shall abide there, nor son of man inhabit
it.</span></li>
<li><span>The word of the Lord that came to Jeremias the prophet
against Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Sedecias king of
Juda, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Behold I will break the bow
of Elam, and their chief strength.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will bring upon Elam the four winds from the fear
quarters of heaven: and I will scatter them into all these winds:
and there shall be no nation, to which the fugitives of Elam shall
not come.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will cause Elam to be afraid before their enemies,
and in the sight of them that seek their life: and I will bring
evil upon them, my fierce wrath, saith the Lord : and will send the
sword after them, till I consume them.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will set my throne in Elam, and destroy kings and
princes from thence, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>But in the latter days I will cause the captives of Elam,
to return, saith the Lord.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="50">Jeremias 50</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>The word that the Lord hath spoken against Babylon, and
against the land of the Chaldeans in the hand of Jeremias the
prophet.</span></li>
<li><span>Declare ye among the nations, and publish it, lift up a
standard: proclaim, and conceal it not: say: Babylon is taken, Bel
is confounded, Merodach is overthrown, their graven things are
confounded, their idols are overthrown.</span></li>
<li><span>For a nation is come up against her out of the north,
which shall make her land desolate: and there shall be none to
dwell therein, from man even to beast:: yea they are removed, and
gone away.</span></li>
<li><span>In those days, and at that time, saith the Lord, the
children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Juda
together: going and weeping they shall make haste, and shall seek
the Lord their God.</span></li>
<li><span>They shall ask the way to Sion, their faces are
hitherward. They shall come, and shall be joined to the Lord by an
everlasting covenant, which shall never be forgotten.</span></li>
<li><span>My people have been a lost flock, their shepherds have
caused them to go astray, and have made them wander in the
mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have
forgotten their resting place.</span></li>
<li><span>All that found them, have devoured them: and their
enemies said: We have not sinned in so doing: because they have
sinned against the Lord the beauty of justice, and against the Lord
the hope of their fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of
the land of the Chaldeans: and be ye as kids at the head of the
flock.</span></li>
<li><span>For behold I raise up, and will bring against Babylon an
assembly of great nations from the land of the north: and they
shall be prepared against her, and from thence she shall be taken:
their arrows, like those of a mighty man, a destroyer, shall not
return in vain.</span></li>
<li><span>And Chaldea shall be made a prey: all that waste her
shall be filled, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Because you rejoice, and speak great things, pillaging my
inheritance: because you are spread abroad as calves upon the
grass, and have bellowed as bulls.</span></li>
<li><span>Your mother is confounded exceedingly, and she that bore
you is made even with the dust: behold she shall be the last among
the nations, a wilderness unpassable, and dry.</span></li>
<li><span>Because of the wrath of the Lord it shall not be
inhabited, but shall be wholly desolate: every one that shall pass
by Babylon, shall be astonished, and hiss at all her
plagues.</span></li>
<li><span>Prepare yourselves against Babylon round about, all you
that bend the bow: fight against her, spare not arrows: because she
hath sinned against the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Shout against her, she hath every where given her hand,
her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down, for it is
the vengeance of the Lord. Take vengeance upon her: as she hath
done, so do to her.</span></li>
<li><span>Destroy the sower out of Babylon, and him that holdeth
the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the sword of the
dove every man shall return to his people, and every one shall flee
to his own land.</span></li>
<li><span>Israel is a scattered flock, the lions have driven him
away: first the king of Assyria devoured him: and last this
Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon hath broken his bones.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel:
Behold I will visit the king of Babylon and his land, as I have
visited the king of Assyria.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will bring Israel again to his habitation: and he
shall feed on Carmel, and Bason, and his soul shall be satisfied in
mount Ephraim, and Galaad.</span></li>
<li><span>In those days, and at that time, saith the Lord, the
iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none:
and the sin of Juda, and there shall none be found: for I will be
merciful to them, whom I shall leave.</span></li>
<li><span>Go up against the land of the rulers, and punish the
inhabitants thereof, waste, and destroy all behind them, saith the
Lord: and do according to all that I have commanded
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>A noise of war in the land, and a great
destruction.</span></li>
<li><span>How is the hammer of the whole earth broken, and
destroyed! how is Babylon turned into a desert among the
nations!</span></li>
<li><span>I have caused thee to fall into a snare, and thou art
taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware of it: thou art found and
caught, because thou hast provoked the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth
the weapons of his wrath : for the Lord the God of hosts hath a
work to be done in the land of the Chaldeans.</span></li>
<li><span>Come ye against her from the uttermost borders: open that
they may go forth that shall tread her down: take the stones out of
the way, and make heaps, and destroy her: and let nothing of her be
left.</span></li>
<li><span>Destroy all her valiant men, let them go down to the
slaughter: woe to them, for their day is come, the time of their
visitation.</span></li>
<li><span>The voice of them that flee, and of them that have
escaped out of the land of Babylon: to declare in Sion the revenge
of the Lord our God, the revenge of his temple.</span></li>
<li><span>Declare to many against Babylon, to all that bend the
bow: stand together against her round about, and let nose escape;
pay her according to her work: according to all that she hath done,
do ye to her: for she hath lifted up herself against the Lord,
against the Holy One of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets: and
all her men of war shall hold their peace in that day, saith the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I come against thee, O proud one, saith the Lord
the God of hosts: for thy day is come, the time of thy
visitation.</span></li>
<li><span>And the proud one shall fall, he shall fall down, and
there shall be none to lift him up: and I will kindle a fire in his
cities, and it shall devour all round about him.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: The children of Israel, and
the children of Juda are oppressed together: all that have taken
them captives, hold them fast, they will not let them
go.</span></li>
<li><span>Their redeemer is strong, the Lord of hosts is his name :
he will defend their cause in judgment, to terrify the land, and to
disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.</span></li>
<li><span>A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the Lord, and upon
the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise
men.</span></li>
<li><span>A sword upon her diviners, and they shall be foolish: a
sword upon her valiant ones, and they shall be
dismayed.</span></li>
<li><span>A sword upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and
upon all the people that are in the midst of her: and they shall
become as women: a sword upon her treasures, and they shall be made
a spoil.</span></li>
<li><span>A drought upon her waters, and they shall be dried up:
because it is a land of idols, and they glory in monstrous
things.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore shall dragons dwell there with the fig fauns:
and ostriches shall dwell therein, and it shall be no more
inhabited for ever, neither shall it be built up from generation to
generation.</span></li>
<li><span>As the Lord overthrew Sodom and Gomorrha, and their
neighbour cities, saith the Lord: no man shall dwell there, neither
shall the son of man inhabit it.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold a people cometh from the north, and a great
nation, and many kings shall rise from the ends of the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>They shall take the bow and the shield: they are cruel
and unmerciful: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall
ride upon horses: like a man prepared for battle against thee, O
daughter of Babylon.</span></li>
<li><span>The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and
his hands are grown feeble: anguish hath taken hold of him, pangs
as a, woman in labour.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of
the Jordan to the strong and beautiful: for I will make him run
suddenly upon her: and who shall be the chosen one whom I may
appoint over her? for who is like to me? and who shall bear up
against me? and who is that shepherd that can withstand my
countenance?</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore hear ye the counsel of the Lord, which he hath
taken against Babylon: and his thoughts which he hath thought
against the land of the Chaldeans: surely the little ones of the
flocks shall pull them down, of a truth their habitation shall be
destroyed with them.</span></li>

and the cry is heard amongst the nations.</span></li>

<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: Behold I will raise up as it were a
pestilential wind against Babylon and against the inhabitants
thereof, who have lifted up their heart against me.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will send to Babylon fanners, and they shall fan
her, and shall destroy her land: for they are come upon her on
every side in the day of her affliction.</span></li>
<li><span>Let not him that bendeth, bend his bow, and let not, him
go up that is armed with a coat of mail: spare not her young men,
destroy all her army.</span></li>
<li><span>And the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans,
and the wounded in the regions thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>For Israel and Juda have not been forsaken by their God
the Lord of hosts: but their land hath been filled with sin against
the Holy One of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Flee ye from the midst of Babylon, and let every one save
his own life: be not silent upon her iniquity: for it is the time
of revenge from the Lord, he will I render unto her what she hath
deserved.</span></li>
<li><span>Babylon hath been a golden cup in the hand of the Lord,
that made all the earth drunk: the nations have drunk of her wine,
and therefore they have staggered.</span></li>
<li><span>Babylon is suddenly fallen, and destroyed: howl for her,
take balm for her pain, if so she may be healed.</span></li>
<li><span>We would have cured Babylon, but she is not healed: let
us forsake her, and let us go every man to his own land: because
her judgment hath reached even to the heavens, and is lifted up to
the clouds.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord hath brought forth our justices: Come, and let
us declare in Sion the work of the Lord our God.</span></li>
<li><span>Sharpen the arrows, fill the quivers, the Lord hath
raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: and his mind is
against Babylon to destroy it, because it is the vengeance of the
Lord, the vengeance of his temple.</span></li>
<li><span>Upon the walls of Babylon set up the standard, strengthen
the watch: set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the Lord
hath both purposed, and done all that he spoke against the
inhabitants of Babylon.</span></li>
<li><span>O thou that dwellest upon many waters, rich in treasures,
thy end is come for thy entire destruction.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying : I will
fill thee with men as with locusts, and they shall lift up a joyful
shout against thee.</span></li>
<li><span>He that made the earth by his power, that hath prepared
the world by his wisdom, and stretched out the heavens by his
understanding.</span></li>
<li><span>When he uttereth his voice the waters are multiplied in
heaven: he lifteth up the clouds from the ends of the earth, he
hath turned lightning into rain: and hath brought forth the wind
out of his treasures.</span></li>
<li><span>Every man is become foolish by his knowledge: every
founder is confounded by his idol, for what he hath cast is a lie,
and there is no breath in them.</span></li>
<li><span>They are vain works, and worthy to be laughed at, in the
time of their visitation they shall perish.</span></li>
<li><span>The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he that made
all things he it is, and Israel is the sceptre of his inheritance:
the Lord of hosts is his name.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou dashest together for me the weapons of war, and with
thee I will dash nations together, and with thee I will destroy
kingdoms:</span></li>
<li><span>And with thee I will break in pieces the horse, and his
rider, and with thee I will break in pieces the chariot, and him
that getteth up into it:</span></li>
<li><span>And with thee I will break in pieces man and woman, and
with thee I will break in pieces the old man and the child, and
with thee I will break in pieces the young man and the
virgin:</span></li>
<li><span>And with thee I will break in pieces the shepherd and his
dock, and with thee I will break in pieces the husbandman and his
yoke of oxen, and with thee I will break in pieces captains and
rulers.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will render to Babylon, and to all the inhabitants
of Chaldea all their evil, that they have done in Sion, before your
eyes, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I come against thee, thou destroying mountain,
saith the Lord, which corruptest the whole earth: and I will
stretch out my hand upon thee, and will roll thee down from the
rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall not take of thee a stone for the corner,
nor a stone for foundations, but thou shalt be destroyed for ever,
saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Set ye up a standard in the land: sound with the trumpet
among the nations: prepare the nations against her: call together
against her the kings of Ararat, Menni, and Ascenez: number Taphsar
against her, bring the horse as the stinging locust.</span></li>
<li><span>Prepare the nations against her, the kings of Media,
their captains, and all their rulers, and all the land of their
dominion.</span></li>
<li><span>And the land shall be in a commotion, and shall be
troubled: for the design of the Lord against Babylon shall awake,
to make the land of Babylon desert and uninhabitable.</span></li>
<li><span>The valiant men of Babylon have forborne to fight, they
have dwelt in holds: their strength hath failed, and they are
become as women: her dwelling places are burnt, her bars are
broken.</span></li>
<li><span>One running post shall meet another, and messenger shall
meet messenger: to tell the king of Babylon that his city is taken
from one end to the other:</span></li>
<li><span>And that the fords are taken, and the marshes are burnt
with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: The
daughter of Babylon is like a thrashingfloor, this is the time of
her thrashing: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest
shall come.</span></li>
<li><span>Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon hath eaten me up, he hath
devoured me: he hath made me as an empty vessel: he hath swallowed
me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicate
meats, and he hath cast me out.</span></li>
<li><span>The wrong done to me, and my flesh be upon Babylon, saith
the habitation of Sion : and my blood upon the inhabitants of
Chaldea, saith Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord: Behold I will judge thy
cause, and will take vengeance for thee, and I will make her sea
desolate, and will dry up her spring.</span></li>
<li><span>And Babylon shall be reduced to heaps, a dwelling place
for dragons, an astonishment and a hissing, because there is no
inhabitant.</span></li>
<li><span>They shall roar together like lions, they shall shake
their manes like young lions.</span></li>
<li><span>In their heat I will set them drink: and I will make them
drunk, that they may slumber, and sleep an everlasting sleep, and
awake no more, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, and
like rams with kids.</span></li>
<li><span>How is Sesach taken, and the renowned one of all the
earth surprised? How is Babylon become an astonishment among the
nations?</span></li>
<li><span>The sea is come up over Babylon: she is covered with the
multitude of the waves thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>Her cities are become an astonishment, a land uninhabited
and desolate, a land wherein none can dwell, nor son of man pass
through it.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will visit against Bel in Babylon, and I will bring
forth out of his mouth that which he had swallowed down: and the
rations shall no more flow together to him, for the wall also of
Babylon shall fall.</span></li>
<li><span>Go out of the midst of her, my people: that every man may
save his life from the fierce wrath of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And lest your hearts faint, and ye fear for the rumour
that shall be heard in the land : and a rumour shall come in one
year, and after this year another rumour: and iniquity in the land,
and ruler upon ruler.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore behold the days come, and I will visit the
idols of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all
her slain shall fall in the midst of her.</span></li>
<li><span>And the heavens and the earth, and all things that are in
them shall give praise for Babylon: for spoilers shall come to her
from the north, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And as Babylon caused that there should fall slain in
Israel: so of Babylon there shall fall slain in all the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>You that have escaped the sword, come away, stand not
still: remember the Lord afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your
mind.</span></li>
<li><span>We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame
hath covered our faces: because strangers are come upon the
sanctuaries of the house of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I
will visit her graven things, and in all her land the wounded shall
groan:</span></li>
<li><span>If Babylon should mount up to heaven, and establish her
strength on high: from me there should come spoilers upon her,
saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>The noise of a cry from Babylon, and great destruction
from the land of the Chaldeans :</span></li>
<li><span>Because the Lord hath laid Babylon waste, and destroyed
out of her the great voice: and their wave shall roar like many
waters: their voice hath made a noise:</span></li>
<li><span>Because the spoiler is come upon her, that is, upon
Babylon, and her valiant men are taken, and their bow is weakened,
because the Lord, who is a strong revenger, will surely
repay.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will make her princes drunk. and her wise men, and
her captains, and her rulers, and her valiant men: and they shall
sleep an everlasting sleep, and shall awake no more, saith the
whose name is Lord of hosts.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: That broad wall of Babylon
shall be utterly broken down, and her high gates shall be burnt
with fire, and the labours of the people shall come to nothing, and
of the nations shall go to the fire, and shall perish.</span></li>
<li><span>The word that Jeremias the prophet commanded Saraias the
son of Nerias, the son of Maasias, when he went with king Sedecias
to Babylon, in the fourth year of his reign: now Saraias was chief
over the prophecy.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jeremias wrote in one book all the evil that was to
come upon Babylon: all these words that are written against
Babylon.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jeremias said to Saraias: When thou shalt come into
Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words,</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt say: O Lord, thou hast spoken against this
place to destroy it: so that there should be neither man nor beast
to dwell therein, and that it should be desolate for
ever.</span></li>
<li><span>And when thou shalt have made an end of reading this
book, thou shalt tie a stone to it, and shalt throw it into the
midst of the Euphrates:</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt say: Thus shall Babylon sink, and she
shall not rise up from the affliction that I will bring upon her,
and she shall be utterly destroyed. Thus far are the words of
Jeremias.</span></li>

<li><span>Sedecias was one and twenty years old when he began to
reign: and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and the name of
his mother was Amital, the daughter of Jerernias of
Lobna.</span></li>
<li><span>And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord,
according to all that Joakim had done.</span></li>
<li><span>For the wrath of the Lord was against Jerusalem, and
against Juda, till he cast t hem out from his presence: and
Sedecias revolted from the king of Babylon.</span></li>
<li><span>And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in
the tenth month, the tenth day of the month, that Nabuchodonosor
the king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem,
and they besieged it, and built forts against it round
about.</span></li>
<li><span>And the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king
Sedecias.</span></li>
<li><span>And in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a
famine overpowered the city: and there was no food for the people
of the land.</span></li>
<li><span>And the city was broken up, and the men of war fled, and
went out of the city in the night by the way of the gate that is
between the two walls, and leadeth to the king's garden, (the
Chaldeans besieging the city round about, ) sad they went by the
way that leadeth to the wilderness.</span></li>
<li><span>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king: and
they overtook Sedecias in the desert which is near Jericho: and all
his companions were scattered from him.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they had taken the king, they carried him to the
king of Babylon to Reblatha, which is in the land of Emath: and he
gave judgment upon him.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Sedecias before
his eyes: and he slew all the princes of Juda in
Reblatha.</span></li>
<li><span>And he put out the eyes of Sedecias, and bound him with
fetters, and the king of Babylon brought him into Babylon, and he
put him in prison till the day of his death.</span></li>
<li><span>And in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, the
same is the nineteenth year of Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon,
came Nabuzardan the general of the army, who stood before the king
of Babylon in Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And he burnt the house of the Lord, and the king's house,
and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great house he burnt
with fire.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the army of the Chaldeans that were with the
general broke down all the wall of Jerusalem round
about.</span></li>
<li><span>But Nabuzardan the general carried away captives some of
the poor people, and of the rest of the common sort who remained in
the city, and of the fugitives that were fled over to the king of
Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.</span></li>
<li><span>But of the poor of the land, Nabuzardan the general left
some for vinedressers, and for husbandmen.</span></li>
<li><span>The Chaldeans also broke in pieces the brazen pillars
that were in the house of the Lord, and the bases, and the sea of
brass that was in the house of the Lord: and they carried all the
brass of them to Babylon.</span></li>
<li><span>And they took the caldrons, and the fleshhooks, and the
psalteries, and the bowls, and the little mortars, and all the
brazen vessels that had been used in the ministry: and</span></li>
<li><span>The general took away the pitchers, and the censers, and
the pots, and the basins, and the candlesticks, and the mortars,
and the cups: as many as were of gold, in gold: and as many as were
of silver, in silver:</span></li>
<li><span>And the two pillars, and one sea, and twelve oxen of
brass that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the
house of the Lord: there was no weight of the brass of all these
vessels.</span></li>
<li><span>And concerning the pillars, one pillar was eighteen
cubits high: and a cord of twelve cubits compassed it about: but
the thickness thereof was four fingers, and it was hollow
within.</span></li>
<li><span>And chapiters of brass were upon both: and the height of
one chapiter was five cubits: and network, and pomegranates were
upon the chapiters round about, all of brass. The same of the
second pillar, and the pomegranates.</span></li>
<li><span>And there were ninety-six pomegranates hanging down: and
the pomegranates being a hundred in all, were compassed with
network.</span></li>
<li><span>And the general took Saraias the chief priest, and
Sophonias the second priest, and the three keepers of the
entry.</span></li>
<li><span>He also took out of the city one eunuch that was chief
over the men of war: and seven men of them that were near the
king's person, that were found in the city: and a scribe, an
officer of the army who exercised the young soldiers: and
threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the
midst of the city.</span></li>
<li><span>And Nabuzardan the general took them, and brought them to
the king of Babylon, to Reblatha.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king of Babylon struck them, and put them to
death in Reblatha, in the land of Emath: and Juda was carried away
captive out of his land.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the people whom Nabuchodonosor carried away
captive : in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three
Jews.</span></li>
<li><span>In the eighteenth year of Nabuchodonosor, eight hundred
and thirty-two souls from Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>In the three and twentieth year of Nabuchodonosor,
Nabuzardan the general carried away of the Jews seven hundred and
forty-five souls. So all the souls were four thousand six
hundred.</span></li>
<li><span>And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of
the captivity of Joachin king of Juda, in the twelfth month, the
five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of
Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of
Joachin king of Juda, and brought him forth out of
prison.</span></li>
<li><span>And he spoke kindly to him, and he set his throne above
the thrones of the kings that were with him in Babylon.</span></li>
<li><span>And he changed his prison garments, and he ate bread
before him always all the days of his life.</span></li>
<li><span>And for his diet a continual provision was allowed him by
the king of Babylon, every day a portion, until the day of his
death, all the days of his life.</span></li>
