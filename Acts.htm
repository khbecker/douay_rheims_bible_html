  <ol>
    <li><span>The former treatise I made, O Theophilus, of all
    things which Jesus began to do and to teach,</span></li>

    <li><span>Until the day on which, giving commandments by the
    Holy Ghost to the apostles whom he had chosen, he was taken
    up.</span></li>

    <li><span>To whom also he shewed himself alive after his
    passion, by many proofs, for forty days appearing to them, and
    speaking of the kingdom of God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And eating together with them, he commanded them,
    that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but should wait for
    the promise of the Father, which you have heard (saith he) by
    my mouth.</span></li>

    <li><span>For John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be
    baptized with the Holy Ghost, not many days hence.</span></li>

    <li><span>They therefore who were come together, asked him,
    saying: Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom
    to Israel?</span></li>

    <li><span>But he said to them: It is not for you to know the
    times or moments, which the Father hath put in his own
    power:</span></li>

    <li><span>But you shall receive the power of the Holy Ghost
    coming upon you, and you shall be witnesses unto me in
    Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and even to the
    uttermost part of the earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had said these things, while they looked
    on, he was raised up: and a cloud received him out of their
    sight.</span></li>

    <li><span>And while they were beholding him going up to heaven,
    behold two men stood by them in white garments.</span></li>

    <li><span>Who also said: Ye men of Galilee, why stand you
    looking up to heaven? This Jesus who is taken up from you into
    heaven, shall so come, as you have seen him going into
    heaven.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount that
    is called Olivet, which is nigh Jerusalem, within a sabbath
    day's journey.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they were come in, they went up into an
    upper room, where abode Peter and John, James and Andrew,
    Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James of Alpheus,
    and Simon Zelotes, and Jude the brother of James.</span></li>

    <li><span>All these were persevering with one mind in prayer
    with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his
    brethren.</span></li>

    <li><span>In those days Peter rising up in the midst of the
    brethren, said: (now the number of persons together was about
    an hundred and twenty:)</span></li>

    <li><span>Men, brethren, the scripture must needs be fulfilled,
    which the Holy Ghost spoke before by the mouth of David
    concerning Judas, who was the leader of them that apprehended
    Jesus:</span></li>

    <li><span>Who was numbered with us, and had obtained part of
    this ministry.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he indeed hath possessed a field of the reward of
    iniquity, and being hanged, burst asunder in the midst: and all
    his bowels gushed out.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it became known to all the inhabitants of
    Jerusalem: so that the same field was called in their tongue,
    Haceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.</span></li>

    <li><span>For it is written in the book of Psalms: Let their
    habitation become desolate, and let there be none to dwell
    therein. And his bishopric let another take.</span></li>

    <li><span>Wherefore of these men who have companied with us all
    the time that the Lord Jesus came in and went out among
    us,</span></li>

    <li><span>Beginning from the baptism of John, until the day
    wherein he was taken up from us, one of these must be made a
    witness with us of his resurrection.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they appointed two, Joseph, called Barsabas, who
    was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</span></li>

    <li><span>And praying, they said: Thou, Lord, who knowest the
    hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast
    chosen,</span></li>

    <li><span>To take the place of this ministry and apostleship,
    from which Judas hath by transgression fallen, that he might go
    to his own place.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they gave them lots, and the lot fell upon
    Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven
    apostles.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="2">Acts 2</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And when the days of the Pentecost were accomplished,
    they were all together in one place:</span></li>

    <li><span>And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a
    mighty wind coming, and it filled the whole house where they
    were sitting.</span></li>

    <li><span>And there appeared to them parted tongues as it were
    of fire, and it sat upon every one of them:</span></li>

    <li><span>And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and
    they began to speak with divers tongues, according as the Holy
    Ghost gave them to speak.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem, Jews, devout
    men, out of every nation under heaven.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when this was noised abroad, the multitude came
    together, and were confounded in mind, because that every man
    heard them speak in his own tongue.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they were all amazed, and wondered, saying:
    Behold, are not all these, that speak, Galileans?</span></li>

    <li><span>And how have we heard, every man our own tongue
    wherein we were born?</span></li>

    <li><span>Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and inhabitants
    of Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and
    Asia,</span></li>

    <li><span>Phrygia, and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the parts of Libya
    about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome,</span></li>

    <li><span>Jews also, and proselytes, Cretes, and Arabians: we
    have heard them speak in our own tongues the wonderful works of
    God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they were all astonished, and wondered, saying
    one to another: What meaneth this?</span></li>

    <li><span>But others mocking, said: These men are full of new
    wine.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Peter standing up with the eleven, lifted up his
    voice, and spoke to them: Ye men of Judea, and all you that
    dwell in Jerusalem, be this known to you, and with your ears
    receive my words.</span></li>

    <li><span>For these are not drunk, as you suppose, seeing it is
    but the third hour of the day:</span></li>

    <li><span>But this is that which was spoken of by the prophet
    Joel:</span></li>

    <li><span>And it shall come to pass, in the last days, (saith
    the Lord,) I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and
    your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men
    shall see visions, and your old men shall dream
    dreams.</span></li>

    <li><span>And upon my servants indeed, and upon my handmaids
    will I pour out in those days of my spirit, and they shall
    prophesy.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I will shew wonders in the heaven above, and
    signs on the earth beneath: blood and fire, and vapour of
    smoke.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon
    into blood, before the great and manifest day of the Lord
    come.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call
    upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved.</span></li>

    <li><span>Ye men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of
    Nazareth, a man approved of God among you, by miracles, and
    wonders, and signs, which God did by him, in the midst of you,
    as you also know:</span></li>

    <li><span>This same being delivered up, by the determinate
    counsel and foreknowledge of God, you by the hands of wicked
    men have crucified and slain.</span></li>

    <li><span>Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the sorrows of
    hell, as it was impossible that he should be holden by
    it.</span></li>

    <li><span>For David saith concerning him: I foresaw the Lord
    before my face: because he is at my right hand, that I may not
    be moved.</span></li>

    <li><span>For this my heart hath been glad, and any tongue hath
    rejoiced: moreover my flesh also shall rest in
    hope.</span></li>

    <li><span>Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, nor
    suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou hast made known to me the ways of life: thou
    shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.</span></li>

    <li><span>Ye men, brethren, let me freely speak to you of the
    patriarch David; that he died, and was buried; and his
    sepulchre is with us to this present day.</span></li>

    <li><span>Whereas therefore he was a prophet, and knew that God
    hath sworn to him with an oath, that of the fruit of his loins
    one should sit upon his throne.</span></li>

    <li><span>Foreseeing this, he spoke of the resurrection of
    Christ. For neither was he left in hell, neither did his flesh
    see corruption.</span></li>

    <li><span>This Jesus hath God raised again, whereof all we are
    witnesses.</span></li>

    <li><span>Being exalted therefore by the right hand of God, and
    having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he
    hath poured forth this which you see and hear.</span></li>

    <li><span>For David ascended not into heaven; but he himself
    said: The Lord said to my Lord, sit thou on my right
    hand,</span></li>

    <li><span>Until I make thy enemies thy footstool.</span></li>

    <li><span>Therefore let all the house of Israel know most
    certainly, that God hath made both Lord and Christ, this same
    Jesus, whom you have crucified.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now when they had heard these things, they had
    compunction in their heart, and said to Peter, and to the rest
    of the apostles: What shall we do, men and
    brethren?</span></li>

    <li><span>But Peter said to them: Do penance, and be baptized
    every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission
    of your sins: and you shall receive the gift of the Holy
    Ghost.</span></li>

    <li><span>For the promise is to you, and to your children, and
    to all that are far off, whomsoever the Lord our God shall
    call.</span></li>

    <li><span>And with very many other words did he testify and
    exhort them, saying: Save yourselves from this perverse
    generation.</span></li>

    <li><span>They therefore that received his word, were baptized;
    and there were added in that day about three thousand
    souls.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they were persevering in the doctrine of the
    apostles, and in the communication of the breaking of bread,
    and in prayers.</span></li>

    <li><span>And fear came upon every soul: many wonders also and
    signs were done by the apostles in Jerusalem, and there was
    great fear in all.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all they that believed, were together, and had
    all things common.</span></li>

    <li><span>Their possessions and goods they sold, and divided
    them to all, according as every one had need.</span></li>

    <li><span>And continuing daily with one accord in the temple,
    and breaking bread from house to house, they took their meat
    with gladness and simplicity of heart;</span></li>

    <li><span>Praising God, and having favour with all the people.
    And the Lord increased daily together such as should be
    saved.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="3">Acts 3</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Now Peter and John went up into the temple at the
    ninth hour of prayer.</span></li>

    <li><span>And a certain man who was lame from his mother's
    womb, was carried: whom they laid every day at the gate of the
    temple, which is called Beautiful, that he might ask alms of
    them that went into the temple.</span></li>

    <li><span>He, when he had seen Peter and John about to go into
    the temple, asked to receive an alms.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Peter with John fastening his eyes upon him,
    said: Look upon us.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he looked earnestly upon them, hoping that he
    should receive something of them.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Peter said: Silver and gold I have none; but what
    I have, I give thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
    arise, and walk.</span></li>

    <li><span>And taking him by the right hand, he lifted him up,
    and forthwith his feet and soles received strength.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he leaping up, stood, and walked, and went in
    with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising
    God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the people saw him walking and praising
    God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they knew him, that it was he who sat begging
    alms at the Beartiful gate of the temple: and they were filled
    with wonder and amazement at that which had happened to
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And as he held Peter and John, all the people ran to
    them to the porch which is called Solomon's, greatly
    wondering.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Peter seeing, made answer to the people: Ye men
    of Israel, why wonder you at this? or why look you upon us, as
    if by our strength or power we had made this man to
    walk?</span></li>

    <li><span>The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God
    of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus,
    whom you indeed delivered up and denied before the face of
    Pilate, when he judged he should be released.</span></li>

    <li><span>But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired
    a murderer to be granted unto you.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the author of life you killed, whom God hath
    raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.</span></li>

    <li><span>And in the faith of his name, this man, whom you have
    seen and known, hath his name strengthened; and the faith which
    is by him, hath given this perfect soundness in the sight of
    you all.</span></li>

    <li><span>And now, brethren, I know that you did it through
    ignorance, as did also your rulers.</span></li>

    <li><span>But those things which God before had shewed by the
    mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should suffer, he
    hath so fulfilled.</span></li>

    <li><span>Be penitent, therefore, and be converted, that your
    sins may be blotted out.</span></li>

    <li><span>That when the times of refreshment shall come from
    the presence of the Lord, and he shall send him who hath been
    preached unto you, Jesus Christ,</span></li>

    <li><span>Whom heaven indeed must receive, until the times of
    the restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the
    mouth of his holy prophets, from the beginning of the
    world.</span></li>

    <li><span>For Moses said: A prophet shall the Lord your God
    raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me: him you shall
    hear according to all things whatsoever he shall speak to
    you.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it shall be, that every soul which will not hear
    that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the
    people.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the prophets, from Samuel and afterwards, who
    have spoken, have told of these days.</span></li>

    <li><span>You are the children of the prophets, and of the
    testament which God made to our fathers, saying to Abraham: And
    in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be
    blessed.</span></li>

    <li><span>To you first God, raising up his Son, hath sent him
    to bless you; that every one may convert himself from his
    wickedness.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="4">Acts 4</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And as they were speaking to the people, the priests,
    and the officer of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon
    them,</span></li>

    <li><span>Being grieved that they taught the people, and
    preached in Jesus the resurrection from the dead:</span></li>

    <li><span>And they laid hands upon them, and put them in hold
    till the next day; for it was now evening.</span></li>

    <li><span>But many of them who had heard the word, believed;
    and the number of the men was made five thousand.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it came to pass on the morrow, that their
    princes, and ancients, and scribes, were gathered together in
    Jerusalem;</span></li>

    <li><span>And Annas the high priest, and Caiphas, and John, and
    Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high
    priest.</span></li>

    <li><span>And setting them in the midst, they asked: By what
    power, or by what name, have you done this?</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said to them:
    Ye princes of the people, and ancients, hear:</span></li>

    <li><span>If we this day are examined concerning the good deed
    done to the infirm man, by what means he hath been made
    whole:</span></li>

    <li><span>Be it known to you all, and to all the people of
    Israel, that by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
    whom you crucified, whom God hath raised from the dead, even by
    him this man standeth here before you whole.</span></li>

    <li><span>This is the stone which was rejected by you the
    builders, which is become the head of the corner.</span></li>

    <li><span>Neither is there salvation in any other. For there is
    no other name under heaven given to men, whereby we must be
    saved.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now seeing the constancy of Peter and of John,
    understanding that they were illiterate and ignorant men, they
    wondered; and they knew them that they had been with
    Jesus.</span></li>

    <li><span>Seeing the man also who had been healed standing with
    them, they could say nothing against it.</span></li>

    <li><span>But they commanded them to go aside out of the
    council; and they conferred among themselves,</span></li>

    <li><span>Saying: What shall we do to these men? for indeed a
    known miracle hath been done by them, to all the inhabitants of
    Jerusalem: it is manifest, and we cannot deny it.</span></li>

    <li><span>But that it may be no farther spread among the
    people, let us threaten them that they speak no more in this
    name to any man.</span></li>

    <li><span>And calling them, they charged them not to speak at
    all, nor teach in the name of Jesus.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Peter and John answering, said to them: If it be
    just in the sight of God, to hear you rather than God, judge
    ye.</span></li>

    <li><span>For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen
    and heard.</span></li>

    <li><span>But they threatening, sent them away, not finding how
    they might punish them, because of the people; for all men
    glorified what had been done, in that which had come to
    pass.</span></li>

    <li><span>For the man was above forty years old, in whom that
    miraculous cure had been wrought.</span></li>

    <li><span>And being let go, they came to their own company, and
    related all that the chief priests and ancients had said to
    them.</span></li>

    <li><span>Who having heard it, with one accord lifted up their
    voice to God, and said: Lord, thou art he that didst make
    heaven and earth, the sea, and all things that are in
    them.</span></li>

    <li><span>Who, by the Holy Ghost, by the mouth of our father
    David, thy servant, hast said: Why did the Gentiles rage, and
    the people meditate vain things?</span></li>

    <li><span>The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes
    assembled together against the Lord and his Christ.</span></li>

    <li><span>For of a truth there assembled together in this city
    against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, Herod,
    and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of
    Israel,</span></li>

    <li><span>To do what thy hand and thy counsel decreed to be
    done.</span></li>

    <li><span>And now, Lord, behold their threatenings, and grant
    unto thy servants, that with all confidence they may speak thy
    word,</span></li>

    <li><span>By stretching forth thy hand to cures, and signs, and
    wonders to be done by the name of thy holy Son
    Jesus.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they had prayed, the place was moved wherein
    they were assembled; and they were all filled with the Holy
    Ghost, and they spoke the word of God with
    confidence.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the multitude of believers had but one heart and
    one soul: neither did any one say that aught of the things
    which he possessed, was his own; but all things were common
    unto them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And with great power did the apostles give testimony
    of the resurrection of Jesus Christ our Lord; and great grace
    was in them all.</span></li>

    <li><span>For neither was there any one needy among them. For
    as many as were owners of lands or houses, sold them, and
    brought the price of the things they sold,</span></li>

    <li><span>And laid it down before the feet of the apostles. And
    distribution was made to every one, according as he had
    need.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Joseph, who, by the apostles, was surnamed
    Barnabas, (which is, by interpretation, The son of
    consolation,) a Levite, a Cyprian born,</span></li>

    <li><span>Having land, sold it, and brought the price, and laid
    it at the feet of the apostles.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="5">Acts 5</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>But a certain man named Ananias, with Saphira his
    wife, sold a piece of land,</span></li>

    <li><span>And by fraud kept back part of the price of the land,
    his wife being privy thereunto: and bringing a certain part of
    it, laid it at the feet of the apostles.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Peter said: Ananias, why hath Satan tempted thy
    heart, that thou shouldst lie to the Holy Ghost, and by fraud
    keep part of the price of the land?</span></li>

    <li><span>Whilst it remained, did it not remain to thee? and
    after it was sold, was it not in thy power? Why hast thou
    conceived this thing in thy heart? Thou hast not lied to men,
    but to God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Ananias hearing these words, fell down, and gave
    up the ghost. And there came great fear upon all that heard
    it.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the young men rising up, removed him, and
    carrying him out, buried him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it was about the space of three hours after, when
    his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Peter said to her: Tell me, woman, whether you
    sold the land for so much? And she said: Yea, for so
    much.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Peter said unto her: Why have you agreed together
    to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold the feet of them who
    have buried thy husband are at the door, and they shall carry
    thee out.</span></li>

    <li><span>Immediately she fell down before his feet, and gave
    up the ghost. And the young men coming in, found her dead: and
    carried her out, and buried her by her husband.</span></li>

    <li><span>And there came great fear upon the whole church, and
    upon all that heard these things.</span></li>

    <li><span>And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and
    wonders wrought among the people. And they were all with one
    accord in Solomon's porch.</span></li>

    <li><span>But of the rest no man durst join himself unto them;
    but the people magnified them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the multitude of men and women who believed in
    the Lord, was more increased:</span></li>

    <li><span>Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the
    streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that when Peter
    came, his shadow at the least, might overshadow any of them,
    and they might be delivered from their infirmities.</span></li>

    <li><span>And there came also together to Jerusalem a multitude
    out of the neighboring cities, bringing sick persons, and such
    as were troubled with unclean spirits; who were all
    healed.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then the high prist rising up, and all they that were
    with him, (which is the heresy of the Sadducees,) were filled
    with envy.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they laid hands on the apostles, and put them in
    the common prison.</span></li>

    <li><span>But an angel of the Lord by night opening the doors
    of the prison, and leading them out, said:</span></li>

    <li><span>Go, and standing speak in the temple to the people
    all the words of this life.</span></li>

    <li><span>Who having heard this, early in the morning, entered
    into the temple, and taught. And the high priest coming, and
    they that were with him, called together the council, and all
    the ancients of the children of Israel; and they sent to the
    prison to have them brought.</span></li>

    <li><span>But when the ministers came, and opening the prison,
    found them not there, they returned and told,</span></li>

    <li><span>Saying: The prison indeed we found shut with all
    diligence, and the keepers standing before the doors; but
    opening it, we found no man within.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now when the officer of the temple and the chief
    priests heard these words, they were in doubt concerning them,
    what would come to pass.</span></li>

    <li><span>But one came and told them: Behold, the men whom you
    put in prison are in the temple standing, and teaching the
    people.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then went the officer with the ministers, and brought
    them without violence; for they feared the people, lest they
    should be stoned.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they had brought them, they set them before
    the council. And the high priest asked them,</span></li>

    <li><span>Saying: Commanding we commanded you, that you should
    not teach in this name; and behold, you have filled Jerusalem
    with your doctrine, and you have a mind to bring the blood of
    this man upon us.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Peter and the apostles answering, said: We ought
    to obey God, rather than men.</span></li>

    <li><span>The God of our fathers hath raised up Jesus, whom you
    put to death, hanging him upon a tree.</span></li>

    <li><span>Him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be
    Prince and Saviour, to give repentance to Israel, and remission
    of sins.</span></li>

    <li><span>And we are witnesses of these things and the Holy
    Ghost, whom God hath given to all that obey him.</span></li>

    <li><span>When they had heard these things, they were cut to
    the heart, and they thought to put them to death.</span></li>

    <li><span>But one in the council rising up, a Pharisee, named
    Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, respected by all the people,
    commanded the men to be put forth a little while.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to them: Ye men of Israel, take heed to
    yourselves what you intend to do, as touching these
    men.</span></li>

    <li><span>For before these days rose up Theodas, affirming
    himself to be somebody, to whom a number of men, about four
    hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all that
    believed him were scattered, and brought to
    nothing.</span></li>

    <li><span>After this man, rose up Judas of Galilee, in the days
    of the enrolling, and drew away the people after him: he also
    perished; and all, even as many as consented to him, were
    dispersed.</span></li>

    <li><span>And now, therefore, I say to you, refrain from these
    men, and let them alone; for if this council or this work be of
    men, it will come to nought;</span></li>

    <li><span>But if it be of God, you cannot overthrow it, lest
    perhaps you be found even to fight against God. And they
    consented to him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And calling in the apostles, after they had scourged
    them, they charged them that they should not speak at all in
    the name of Jesus; and they dismissed them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they indeed went from the presence of the
    council, rejoicing that they were accounted worthy to suffer
    reproach for the name of Jesus.</span></li>

    <li><span>And every day they ceased not in the temple, and from
    house to house, to teach and preach Christ Jesus.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="6">Acts 6</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And in those days, the number of the disciples
    increasing, there arose a murmuring of the Greeks against the
    Hebrews, for that their widows were neglected in the daily
    ministration.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then the twelve calling together the multitude of the
    disciples, said: It is not reason that we should leave the word
    of God, and serve tables.</span></li>

    <li><span>Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men
    of good reputation, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we
    may appoint over this business.</span></li>

    <li><span>But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and
    to the ministry of the word.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the saying was liked by all the multitude. And
    they chose Stephen, a man full of faith, and of the Holy Ghost,
    and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and
    Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch.</span></li>

    <li><span>These they set before the apostles; and they praying,
    imposed hands upon them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the word of the Lord increased; and the number of
    the disciples was multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly: a great
    multitude also of the priests obeyed the faith.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Stephen, full of grace and fortitude, did great
    wonders and signs among the people.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now there arose some of that which is called the
    synagogue of the Libertines, and of the Cyrenians, and of the
    Alexandrians, and of them that were of Cilicia and Asia,
    disputing with Stephen.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the
    spirit that spoke.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then they suborned men to say, they had heard him
    speak words of blasphemy against Moses and against
    God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they stirred up the people, and the ancients, and
    the scribes; and running together, they took him, and brought
    him to the council.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they set up false witnesses, who said: This man
    ceaseth not to speak words against the holy place and the
    law.</span></li>

    <li><span>For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of
    Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the
    traditions which Moses delivered unto us.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all that sat in the council, looking on him, saw
    his face as if it had been the face of an angel.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="7">Acts 7</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Then the high priest said: Are these things
    so?</span></li>

    <li><span>Who said: Ye men, brethren, and fathers, hear. The
    God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in
    Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charan.</span></li>

    <li><span>And said to him: Go forth out of thy country, and
    from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew
    thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then he went out of the land of the Chaldeans, and
    dwelt in Charan. And from thence, after his father was dead, he
    removed him into this land, wherein you now dwell.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he gave him no inheritance in it; no, not the
    pace of a foot: but he promised to give it him in possession,
    and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no
    child.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God said to him: That his seed should sojourn in
    a strange country, and that they should bring them under
    bondage, and treat them evil four hundred years.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the nation which they shall serve will I judge,
    said the Lord; and after these things they shall go out, and
    shall serve me in this place.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he gave him the covenant of circumcision, and so
    he begot Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac
    begot Jacob; and Jacob the twelve patriarchs.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the patriarchs, through envy, sold Joseph into
    Egypt; and God was with him,</span></li>

    <li><span>And delivered him out of all his tribulations: and he
    gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharao, the king of
    Egypt; and he appointed him governor over Egypt, and over all
    his house.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now there came a famine upon all Egypt and Chanaan,
    and great tribulation; and our fathers found no
    food.</span></li>

    <li><span>But when Jacob had heard that there was corn in
    Egypt, he sent our fathers first:</span></li>

    <li><span>And at the second time, Joseph was known by his
    brethren, and his kindred was made known to Pharao.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Joseph sending, called thither Jacob, his father,
    and all his kindred, seventy-five souls.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Jacob went down into Egypt; and he died, and our
    fathers.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they were translated into Sichem, and were laid
    in the sepulchre, that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the
    sons of Hemor, the son of Sichem.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the time of the promise drew near, which God
    had promised to Abraham, the people increased, and were
    multiplied in Egypt,</span></li>

    <li><span>Till another king arose in Egypt, who knew not
    Joseph.</span></li>

    <li><span>This same dealing craftily with our race, afflicted
    our fathers, that they should expose their children, to the end
    they might not be kept alive.</span></li>

    <li><span>At the same time was Moses born, and he was
    acceptable to God: who was nourished three months in his
    father's house.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he was exposed, Pharao's daughter took him
    up, and nourished him for her own son.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the
    Egyptians; and he was mighty in his words and in his
    deeds.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he was full forty years old, it came into
    his heart to visit his brethren, the children of
    Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had seen one of them suffer wrong, he
    defended him; and striking the Egyptian, he avenged him who
    suffered the injury.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he thought that his brethren understood that God
    by his hand would save them; but they understood it
    not.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the day following, he shewed himself to them when
    they were at strife; and would have reconciled them in peace,
    saying: Men, ye are brethren; why hurt you one
    another?</span></li>

    <li><span>But he that did the injury to his neighbour thrust
    him away, saying: Who hath appointed thee prince and judge over
    us?</span></li>

    <li><span>What, wilt thou kill me, as thou didst yesterday kill
    the Egyptian?</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses fled upon this word, and was a stranger in
    the land of Madian, where he begot two sons.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when forty years were expired, there appeared to
    him in the desert of mount Sina, an angel in a flame of fire in
    a bush.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses seeing it, wondered at the sight. And as he
    drew near to view it, the voice of the Lord came unto him,
    saying:</span></li>

    <li><span>I am the God of thy fathers; the God of Abraham, the
    God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses being terrified,
    durst not behold.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to him: Loose the shoes from thy
    feet, for the place wherein thou standest, is holy
    ground.</span></li>

    <li><span>Seeing I have seen the affliction of my people which
    is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down
    to deliver them. And now come, and I will send thee into
    Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>This Moses, whom they refused, saying: Who hath
    appointed thee prince and judge? him God sent to be prince and
    redeemer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the
    bush.</span></li>

    <li><span>He brought them out, doing wonders and signs in the
    land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the desert forty
    years.</span></li>

    <li><span>This is that Moses who said to the children of
    Israel: A prophet shall God raise up to you of your own
    brethren, as myself: him shall you hear.</span></li>

    <li><span>This is he that was in the church in the wilderness,
    with the angel who spoke to him on mount Sina, and with our
    fathers; who received the words of life to give unto
    us.</span></li>

    <li><span>Whom our fathers would not obey; but thrust him away,
    and in their hearts turned back into Egypt,</span></li>

    <li><span>Saying to Aaron: Make us gods to go before us. For as
    for this Moses, who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we
    know not what is become of him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they made a calf in those days, and offered
    sacrifices to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own
    hands.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God turned, and gave them up to serve the host of
    heaven, as it is written in the books of the prophets: Did you
    offer victims and sacrifices to me for forty years, in the
    desert, O house of Israel?</span></li>

    <li><span>And you took unto you the tabernacle of Moloch, and
    the star of your god Rempham, figures which you made to adore
    them. And I will carry you away beyond Babylon.</span></li>

    <li><span>The tabernacle of the testimony was with our fathers
    in the desert, as God ordained for them, speaking to Moses,
    that he should make it according to the form which he had
    seen.</span></li>

    <li><span>Which also our fathers receiving, brought in with
    Jesus, into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drove out
    before the face of our fathers, unto the days of
    David.</span></li>

    <li><span>Who found grace before God, and desired to find a
    tabernacle for the God of Jacob.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Solomon built him a house.</span></li>

    <li><span>Yet the most High dwelleth not in houses made by
    hands, as the prophet saith:</span></li>

    <li><span>Heaven is my throne, and the earth my footstool. What
    house will you build me? saith the Lord; or what is the place
    of my resting?</span></li>

    <li><span>Hath not my hand made all these things?</span></li>

    <li><span>You stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears,
    you always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do
    you also.</span></li>

    <li><span>Which of the prophets have not your fathers
    persecuted? And they have slain them who foretold of the coming
    of the Just One; of whom you have been now the betrayers and
    murderers:</span></li>

    <li><span>Who have received the law by the disposition of
    angels, and have not kept it.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now hearing these things, they were cut to the heart,
    and they gnashed with their teeth at him.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looking up
    steadfastly to heaven, saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing
    on the right hand of God. And he said: Behold, I see the
    heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand
    of God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they crying out with a loud voice, stopped their
    ears, and with one accord ran violently upon him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And casting him forth without the city, they stoned
    him; and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of
    a young man, whose name was Saul.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they stoned Stephen, invoking, and saying: Lord
    Jesus, receive my spirit.</span></li>

    <li><span>And falling on his knees, he cried with a loud voice,
    saying: Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had
    said this, he fell asleep in the Lord. And Saul was consenting
    to his death.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="8">Acts 8</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And at that time there was raised a great persecution
    against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all
    dispersed through the countries of Judea, and Samaria, except
    the apostles.</span></li>

    <li><span>And devout men took order for Stephen's funeral, and
    made great mourning over him.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Saul made havock of the church, entering in from
    house to house, and dragging away men and women, committed them
    to prison.</span></li>

    <li><span>They therefore that were dispersed, went about
    preaching the word of God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Philip going down to the city of Samaria,
    preached Christ unto them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the people with one accord were attentive to
    those things which were said by Philip, hearing, and seeing the
    miracles which he did.</span></li>

    <li><span>For many of them who had unclean spirits, crying with
    a loud voice, went out.</span></li>

    <li><span>And many, taken with the palsy, and that were lame,
    were healed.</span></li>

    <li><span>There was therefore great joy in that city. Now there
    was a certain man named Simon, who before had been a magician
    in that city, seducing the people of Samaria, giving out that
    he was some great one:</span></li>

    <li><span>To whom they all gave ear, from the least to the
    greatest, saying: This man is the power of God, which is called
    great.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they were attentive to him, because, for a long
    time, he had bewitched them with his magical
    practices.</span></li>

    <li><span>But when they had believed Philip preaching of the
    kingdom of God, in the name of Jesus Christ, they were
    baptized, both men and women.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Simon himself believed also; and being baptized,
    he adhered to Philip. And being astonished, wondered to see the
    signs and exceeding great miracles which were done.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now when the apostles, who were in Jerusalem, had
    heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto
    them Peter and John.</span></li>

    <li><span>Who, when they were come, prayed for them, that they
    might receive the Holy Ghost.</span></li>

    <li><span>For he was not as yet come upon any of them; but they
    were only baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then they laid their hands upon them, and they
    received the Holy Ghost.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Simon saw, that by the imposition of the
    hands of the apostles, the Holy Ghost was given, he offered
    them money,</span></li>

    <li><span>Saying: Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I
    shall lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. But Peter
    said to him:</span></li>

    <li><span>Keep thy money to thyself, to perish with thee,
    because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased
    with money.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou hast no part nor lot in this matter. For thy
    heart is not right in the sight of God.</span></li>

    <li><span>Do penance therefore for this thy wickedness; and
    pray to God, that perhaps this thought of thy heart may be
    forgiven thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>For I see thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in
    the bonds of iniquity.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Simon answering, said: Pray you for me to the
    Lord, that none of these things which you have spoken may come
    upon me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they indeed having testified and preached the
    word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the
    gospel to many countries of the Samaritans.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying:
    Arise, go towards the south, to the way that goeth down from
    Jerusalem into Gaza: this is desert.</span></li>

    <li><span>And rising up, he went. And behold a man of Ethiopia,
    an eunuch, of great authority under Candace the queen of the
    Ethiopians, who had charge over all her treasures, had come to
    Jerusalem to adore.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he was returning, sitting in this chariot, and
    reading Isaias the prophet.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Spirit said to Philip: Go near, and join
    thyself to this chariot.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Philip running thither, heard him reading the
    prophet Isaias. And he said: Thinkest thou that thou
    understandest what thou readest?</span></li>

    <li><span>Who said: And how can I, unless some man shew me? And
    he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the place of the scripture which he was reading
    was this: He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a
    lamb without voice before his shearer, so openeth he not his
    mouth.</span></li>

    <li><span>In humility his judgment was taken away. His
    generation who shall declare, for his life shall be taken from
    the earth?</span></li>

    <li><span>And the eunuch answering Philip, said: I beseech
    thee, of whom doth the prophet speak this? of himself, or of
    some other man?</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Philip, opening his mouth, and beginning at this
    scripture, preached unto him Jesus.</span></li>

    <li><span>And as they went on their way, they came to a certain
    water; and the eunuch said: See, here is water: what doth
    hinder me from being baptized?</span></li>

    <li><span>And Philip said: If thou believest with all thy
    heart, thou mayest. And he answering, said: I believe that
    Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he commanded the chariot to stand still; and they
    went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch: and he
    baptized him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they were come up out of the water, the
    Spirit of the Lord took away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no
    more. And he went on his way rejoicing.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Philip was found in Azotus; and passing through,
    he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to
    Caesarea.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="9">Acts 9</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And Saul, as yet breathing out threatenings and
    slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high
    priest,</span></li>

    <li><span>And asked of him letters to Damascus, to the
    synagogues: that if he found any men and wemen of this way, he
    might bring them bound to Jerusalem.</span></li>

    <li><span>And as he went on his journey, it came to pass that
    he drew nigh to Damascus; and suddenly a light from heaven
    shined round about him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And falling on the ground, he heard a voice saying to
    him: Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</span></li>

    <li><span>Who said: Who art thou, Lord? And he: I am Jesus whom
    thou persecutest. It is hard for thee to kick against the
    goad.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he trembling and astonished, said: Lord, what
    wilt thou have me to do?</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to him: Arise, and go into the
    city, and there it shall be told thee what thou must do. Now
    the men who went in company with him, stood amazed, hearing
    indeed a voice, but seeing no man.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Saul arose from the ground; and when his eyes
    were opened, he saw nothing. But they leading him by the hands,
    brought him to Damascus.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he was there three days, without sight, and he
    did neither eat nor drink.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named
    Ananias. And the Lord said to him in a vision: Ananias. And he
    said: Behold I am here, Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to him: Arise, and go into the
    street that is called Stait, and seek in the house of Judas,
    one named Saul of Tarsus. For behold he prayeth.</span></li>

    <li><span>(And he saw a man named Ananias coming in, and
    putting his hands upon him, that he might receive his
    sight.)</span></li>

    <li><span>But Ananias answered: Lord, I have heard by many of
    this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints in
    Jerusalem.</span></li>

    <li><span>And here he hath authority from the chief priests to
    bind all that invoke thy name.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to him: Go thy way; for this man is
    to me a vessel of election, to carry my name before the
    Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>For I will shew him how great things he must suffer
    for my name's sake.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house.
    And laying his hands upon him, he said: Brother Saul, the Lord
    Jesus hath sent me, he that appeared to thee in the way as thou
    camest; that thou mayest receive thy sight, and be filled with
    the Holy Ghost.</span></li>

    <li><span>And immediately there fell from his eyes as it were
    scales, and he received his sight; and rising up, he was
    baptized.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had taken meat, he was strengthened. And
    he was with the disciples that were at Damascus, for some
    days.</span></li>

    <li><span>And immediately he preached Jesus in the synagogues,
    that he is the Son of God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all that heard him, were astonished, and said: Is
    not this he who persecuted in Jerusalem those that called upon
    this name: and came hither for that intent, that he might carry
    them bound to the chief priests?</span></li>

    <li><span>But Saul increased much more in strength, and
    confounded the Jews who dwelt at Damascus, affirming that this
    is the Christ.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when many days were passed, the Jews consulted
    together to kill him.</span></li>

    <li><span>But their laying in wait was made known to Saul. And
    they watched the gates also day and night, that they might kill
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the disciples taking him in the night, conveyed
    him away by the wall, letting him down in a basket.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he was come into Jerusalem, he essayed to
    join himself to the disciples; and they all were afraid of him,
    not believing that he was a disciple.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the
    apostles, and told them how he had seen the Lord, and that he
    had spoken to him; and how in Damascus he had dealt confidently
    in the name of Jesus.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he was with them coming in and going out in
    Jerusalem, and dealing confidently in the name of the
    Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>He spoke also to the Gentiles, and disputed with the
    Greeks; but they sought to kill him.</span></li>

    <li><span>Which when the brethren had known, they brought him
    down to Caesarea, and sent him away to Tarsus.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now the church had peace throughout all Judea, and
    Galilee, and Samaria; and was edified, walking in the fear of
    the Lord, and was filled with the consolation of the Holy
    Ghost.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it came to pass that Peter, as he passed through,
    visiting all, came to the saints who dwelt at
    Lydda.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he found there a certain man named Eneas, who had
    kept his bed for eight years, who was ill of the
    palsy.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Peter said to him: Eneas, the Lord Jesus Christ
    healeth thee: arise, and make thy bed. And immediately he
    arose.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron, saw him: who
    were converted to the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And in Joppe there was a certain disciple named
    Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas. This woman
    was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it came to pass in those days that she was sick,
    and died. Whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper
    chamber.</span></li>

    <li><span>And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppe, the
    disciples hearing that Peter was there, sent unto him two men,
    desiring him that he would not be slack to come unto
    them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Peter rising up, went with them. And when he was
    come, they brought him into the upper chamber. And all the
    widows stood about him weeping, and shewing him the coats and
    garments which Dorcas made them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they all being put forth, Peter kneeling down
    prayed, and turning to the body, he said: Tabitha, arise. And
    she opened her eyes; and seeing Peter, she sat up.</span></li>

    <li><span>And giving her his hand, he lifted her up. And when
    he had called the saints and the widows, he presented her
    alive.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it was made known throughout all Joppe; and many
    believed in the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it came to pass, that he abode many days in
    Joppe, with one Simon a tanner.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="10">Acts 10</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And there was a certain man in Caesarea, named
    Cornelius, a centurion of that which is called the Italian
    band;</span></li>

    <li><span>A religious man, and fearing God with all his house,
    giving much alms to the people, and always praying to
    God.</span></li>

    <li><span>This man saw in a vision manifestly, about the ninth
    hour of the day, an angel of God coming in unto him, and saying
    to him: Cornelius.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he, beholding him, being seized with fear, said:
    What is it, Lord? And he said to him: Thy prayers and thy alms
    are ascended for a memorial in the sight of God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And now send men to Joppe, and call hither one Simon,
    who is surnamed Peter:</span></li>

    <li><span>He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by
    the sea side. He will tell thee what thou must do.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the angel who spoke to him was departed, he
    called two of his household servants, and a soldier who feared
    the Lord, of them that were under him.</span></li>

    <li><span>To whom when he had related all, he sent them to
    Joppe.</span></li>

    <li><span>And on the next day, whilst they were going on their
    journey, and drawing nigh to the city, Peter went up to the
    higher parts of the house to pray, about the sixth
    hour.</span></li>

    <li><span>And being hungry, he was desirous to taste somewhat.
    And as they were preparing, there came upon him an ecstasy of
    mind.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he saw the heaven opened, and a certain vessel
    descending, as it were a great linen sheet let down by the four
    corners from heaven to the earth:</span></li>

    <li><span>Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts, and
    creeping things of the earth, and fowls of the air.</span></li>

    <li><span>And there came a voice to him: Arise, Peter; kill and
    eat.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Peter said: Far be it from me; for I never did
    eat any thing that is common and unclean.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the voice spoke to him again the second time:
    That which God hath cleansed, do not thou call
    common.</span></li>

    <li><span>And this was done thrice; and presently the vessel
    was taken up into heaven.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now, whilst Peter was doubting within himself, what
    the vision that he had seen should mean, behold the men who
    were sent from Cornelius, inquiring for Simon's house, stood at
    the gate.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they had called, they asked, if Simon, who
    is surnamed Peter, were lodged there.</span></li>

    <li><span>And as Peter was thinking of the vision, the Spirit
    said to him: Behold three men seek thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>Arise, therefore, get thee down and go with them,
    doubting nothing: for I have sent them.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Peter, going down to the men, said: Behold, I am
    he whom you seek; what is the cause for which you are
    come?</span></li>

    <li><span>Who said: Cornelius, a centurion, a just man, and one
    that feareth God, and having good testimony from all the nation
    of the Jews, received an answer of an holy angel, to send for
    thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then bringing them in, he lodged them. And the day
    following he arose, and went with them: and some of the
    brethren from Joppe accompanied him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the morrow after, he entered into Caesarea. And
    Cornelius waited for them, having called together his kinsmen
    and special friends.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it came to pass, that when Peter was come in,
    Cornelius came to meet him, Cornelius came to meet him, and
    falling at his feet adored.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Peter lifted him up, saying: Arise, I myself also
    am a man.</span></li>

    <li><span>And talking with him, he went in, and found many that
    were come together.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to them: You know how abominable it is
    for a man that is a Jew, to keep company or to come unto one of
    another nation: but God hath shewed to me, to call no man
    common or unclean.</span></li>

    <li><span>For which cause, making no doubt, I came when I was
    sent for. I ask, therefore, for what cause you have sent for
    me?</span></li>

    <li><span>And Cornelius said: Four days ago, unto this hour, I
    was praying in my house, at the ninth hour, and behold a man
    stood before me in white apparel, and said:</span></li>

    <li><span>Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thy alms are had
    in remembrance in the sight of God.</span></li>

    <li><span>Send therefore to Joppe, and call hither Simon, who
    is surnamed Peter: he lodgeth in the house of Simon a tanner,
    by the sea side.</span></li>

    <li><span>Immediately therefore I sent to thee: and thou hast
    done well in coming. Now therefore all we are present in thy
    sight, to hear all things whatsoever are commanded thee by the
    Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Peter opening his mouth, said: In very deed I
    perceive, that God is not a respecter of persons.</span></li>

    <li><span>But in every nation, he that feareth him, and worketh
    justice, is acceptable to him.</span></li>

    <li><span>God sent the word to the children of Israel,
    preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of
    all.)</span></li>

    <li><span>You know the word which hath been published through
    all Judea: for it began from Galilee, after the baptism which
    John preached,</span></li>

    <li><span>Jesus of Nazareth: how God anointed him with the Holy
    Ghost, and with power, who went about doing good, and healing
    all that were oppressed by the devil, for God was with
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And we are witnesses of all things that he did in the
    land of the Jews and in Jerusalem, whom they killed, hanging
    him upon a tree.</span></li>

    <li><span>Him God raised up the third day, and gave him to be
    made manifest,</span></li>

    <li><span>Not to all the people, but to witnesses preordained
    by God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he
    arose again from the dead;</span></li>

    <li><span>And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to
    testify that it is he who was appointed by God, to be judge of
    the living and of the dead.</span></li>

    <li><span>To him all the prophets give testimony, that by his
    name all receive remission of sins, who believe in
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>While Peter was yet speaking these words, the Holy
    Ghost fell on all them that heard the word.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the faithful of the circumcision, who came with
    Peter, were astonished, for that the grace of the Holy Ghost
    was poured out upon the Gentiles also.</span></li>

    <li><span>For they heard them speaking with tongues, and
    magnifying God.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Peter answered: Can any man forbid water, that
    these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Ghost,
    as well as we?</span></li>

    <li><span>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of
    the Lord Jesus Christ. Then they desired him to tarry with them
    some days.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="11">Acts 11</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And the apostles and brethren, who were in Judea,
    heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of
    God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that
    were of the circumcision contended with him,</span></li>

    <li><span>Saying: Why didst thou go in to men uncircumcised,
    and didst eat with them?</span></li>

    <li><span>But Peter began and declared to them the matter in
    order, saying:</span></li>

    <li><span>I was in the city of Joppe praying, and I saw in an
    ecstasy of mind a vision, a certain vessel descending, as it
    were a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners, and it
    came even unto me.</span></li>

    <li><span>Into which looking, I considered, and saw fourfooted
    creatures of the earth, and beasts, and creeping things, and
    fowls of the air:</span></li>

    <li><span>And I heard also a voice saying to me: Arise, Peter;
    kill and eat.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I said: Not so, Lord; for nothing common or
    unclean hath ever entered into my mouth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the voice answered again from heaven: What God
    hath made clean, do not thou call common.</span></li>

    <li><span>And this was done three times: and all were taken up
    again into heaven.</span></li>

    <li><span>And behold, immediately there were three men come to
    the house wherein I was, sent to me from Caesarea.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Spirit said to me, that I should go with
    them, nothing doubting. And these six brethren went with me
    also: and we entered into the man's house.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he told us how he had seen an angel in his house,
    standing, and saying to him: Send to Joppe, and call hither
    Simon, who is surnamed Peter,</span></li>

    <li><span>Who shall speak to thee words, whereby thou shalt be
    saved, and all thy house.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when I had begun to speak, the Holy Ghost fell
    upon them, as upon us also in the beginning.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I remembered the word of the Lord, how that he
    said: John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be
    baptized with the Holy Ghost.</span></li>

    <li><span>If then God gave them the same grace, as to us also
    who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ; who was I, that could
    withstand God?</span></li>

    <li><span>Having heard these things, they held their peace, and
    glorified God, saying: God then hath also to the Gentiles given
    repentance unto life.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now they who had been dispersed by the persecution
    that arose on occasion of Stephen, went about as far as Phenice
    and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to none, but to the
    Jews only.</span></li>

    <li><span>But some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who,
    when they were entered into Antioch, spoke also to the Greeks,
    preaching the Lord Jesus.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great
    number believing, were converted to the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the tidings came to the ears of the church that
    was at Jerusalem, touching these things: and they sent Barnabas
    as far as Antioch.</span></li>

    <li><span>Who, when he was come, and had seen the grace of God,
    rejoiced: and he exhorted them all with purpose of heart to
    continue in the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and
    of faith. And a great multitude was added to the
    Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Barnabas went to Tarsus to seek Saul: whom, when
    he had found, he brought to Antioch.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they conversed there in the church a whole year;
    and they taught a great multitude, so that at Antioch the
    disciples were first named Christians.</span></li>

    <li><span>And in these days there came prophets from Jerusalem
    to Antioch:</span></li>

    <li><span>And one of them named Agabus, rising up, signified by
    the Spirit, that there should be a great famine over the whole
    world, which came to pass under Claudius.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the disciples, every man according to his
    ability, purposed to send relief to the brethren who dwelt in
    Judea:</span></li>

    <li><span>Which also they did, sending it to the ancients, by
    the hands of Barnabas and Saul.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="12">Acts 12</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And at the same time, Herod the king stretched forth
    his hands, to afflict some of the church.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he killed James, the brother of John, with the
    sword.</span></li>

    <li><span>And seeing that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to
    take up Peter also. Now it was in the days of the
    Azymes.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had apprehended him, he cast him into
    prison, delivering him to four files of soldiers to be kept,
    intending, after the pasch, to bring him forth to the
    people.</span></li>

    <li><span>Peter therefore was kept in prison. But prayer was
    made without ceasing by the church unto God for
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same
    night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two
    chains: and the keepers before the door kept the
    prison.</span></li>

    <li><span>And behold an angel of the Lord stood by him: and a
    light shined in the room: and he striking Peter on the side,
    raised him up, saying: Arise quickly. And the chains fell off
    from his hands.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the angel said to him: Gird thyself, and put on
    thy sandals. And he did so. And he said to him: Cast thy
    garment about thee, and follow me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And going out, he followed him, and he knew not that
    it was true which was done by the angel: but thought he saw a
    vision.</span></li>

    <li><span>And passing through the first and the second ward,
    they came to the iron gate that leadeth to the city, which of
    itself opened to them. And going out, they passed on through
    one street: and immediately the angel departed from
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Peter coming to himself, said: Now I know in very
    deed, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me
    out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the
    people of the Jews.</span></li>

    <li><span>And considering, he came to the house of Mary the
    mother of John, who was surnamed Mark, where many were gathered
    together and praying.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel
    came to hearken, whose name was Rhode.</span></li>

    <li><span>And as soon as she knew Peter's voice, she opened not
    the gate for joy, but running in she told that Peter stood
    before the gate.</span></li>

    <li><span>But they said to her: Thou art mad. But she affirmed
    that it was so. Then said they: It is his angel.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Peter continued knocking. And when they had
    opened, they saw him, and were astonished.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he beckoning to them with his hand to hold their
    peace, told how the Lord had brought him out of prison, and he
    said: Tell these things to James, and to the brethren. And
    going out, he went into another place.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now when day was come, there was no small stir among
    the soldiers, what was become of Peter.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not;
    having examined the keepers, he commanded they should be put to
    death; and going down from Judea to Caesarea, he abode
    there.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he was angry with the Tyrians and the Sidonians.
    But they with one accord came to him, and having gained
    Blastus, who was the king's chamberlain, they desired peace,
    because their countries were nourished by him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And upon a day appointed, Herod being arrayed in
    kingly apparel, sat in the judgment seat, and made an oration
    to them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the people made acclamation, saying: It is the
    voice of a god, and not of a man.</span></li>

    <li><span>And forthwith an angel of the Lord struck him,
    because he had not given the honour to God: and being eaten up
    by worms, he gave up the ghost.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the word of the Lord increased and
    multiplied.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, having
    fulfilled their ministry, taking with them John, who was
    surnamed Mark.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="13">Acts 13</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Now there were in the church which was at Antioch,
    prophets and doctors, among whom was Barnabas, and Simon who
    was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manahen, who was
    the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.</span></li>

    <li><span>And as they were ministering to the Lord, and
    fasting, the Holy Ghost said to them: Separate me Saul and
    Barnabas, for the work whereunto I have taken them.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then they, fasting and praying, and imposing their
    hands upon them, sent them away.</span></li>

    <li><span>So they being sent by the Holy Ghost, went to
    Seleucia: and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they were come to Salamina, they preached
    the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had
    John also in the ministry.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they had gone through the whole island, as
    far as Paphos, they found a certain man, a magician, a false
    prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-jesu:</span></li>

    <li><span>Who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, a prudent
    man. He sending for Barnabas and Saul, desired to hear the word
    of God.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Elymas the magician (for so his name is
    interpreted) withstood them, seeking to turn away the proconsul
    from the faith.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Saul, otherwise Paul, filled with the Holy
    Ghost, looking upon him,</span></li>

    <li><span>Said: O full of all guile, and of all deceit, child
    of the devil, enemy of all justice, thou ceasest not to pervert
    the right ways of the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And now behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee,
    and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a time. And
    immediately there fell a mist and darkness upon him, and going
    about, he sought some one to lead him by the hand.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then the proconsul, when he had seen what was done,
    believed, admiring at the doctrine of the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now when Paul and they that were with him had sailed
    from Paphos, they came to Perge in Pamphylia. And John
    departing from them, returned to Jerusalem.</span></li>

    <li><span>But they passing through Perge, came to Antioch in
    Pisidia: and entering into the synagogue on the sabbath day,
    they sat down.</span></li>

    <li><span>And after the reading of the law and the prophets,
    the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying: Ye men,
    brethren, if you have any word of exhortation to make to the
    people, speak.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Paul rising up, and with his hand bespeaking
    silence, said: Ye men of Israel, and you that fear God, give
    ear.</span></li>

    <li><span>The God of the people of Israel chose our fathers,
    and exalted the people when they were sojourners in the land of
    Egypt, and with an high arm brought them out from
    thence,</span></li>

    <li><span>And for the space of forty years endured their
    manners in the desert.</span></li>

    <li><span>And destroying seven nations in the land of Chanaan,
    divided their land among them, by lot,</span></li>

    <li><span>As it were, after four hundred and fifty years: and
    after these things, he gave unto them judges, until Samuel the
    prophet.</span></li>

    <li><span>And after that they desired a king: and God gave them
    Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, forty
    years.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had removed him, he raised them up David
    to be king: to whom giving testimony, he said: I have found
    David, the son of Jesse, a man according to my own heart, who
    shall do all my wills.</span></li>

    <li><span>Of this man's seed God according to his promise, hath
    raised up to Israel a Saviour, Jesus:</span></li>

    <li><span>John first preaching, before his coming, the baptism
    of penance to all the people of Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when John was fulfilling his course, he said: I
    am not he, whom you think me to be: but behold, there cometh
    one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to
    loose.</span></li>

    <li><span>Men, brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and
    whosoever among you fear God, to you the word of this salvation
    is sent.</span></li>

    <li><span>For they that inhabited Jerusalem, and the rulers
    thereof, not knowing him, nor the voices of the prophets, which
    are read every sabbath, judging him have fulfilled
    them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And finding no cause of death in him, they desired of
    Pilate, that they might kill him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they had fulfilled all things that were
    written of him, taking him down from the tree, they laid him in
    a sepulchre.</span></li>

    <li><span>But God raised him up from the dead the third
    day:</span></li>

    <li><span>Who was seen for many days, by them who came up with
    him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who to this present are his
    witnesses to the people.</span></li>

    <li><span>And we declare unto you, that the promise which was
    made to our fathers,</span></li>

    <li><span>This same God hath fulfilled to our children, raising
    up Jesus, as in the second psalm also is written: Thou art my
    Son, this day have I begotten thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>And to shew that he raised him up from the dead, not
    to return now any more to corruption, he said thus: I will give
    you the holy things of David faithful.</span></li>

    <li><span>And therefore, in another place also, he saith: Thou
    shalt not suffer thy holy one to see corruption.</span></li>

    <li><span>For David, when he had served in his generation,
    according to the will of God, slept: and was laid unto his
    fathers, and saw corruption.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he whom God hath raised from the dead, saw no
    corruption.</span></li>

    <li><span>Be it known therefore to you, men, brethren, that
    through him forgiveness of sins is preached to you: and from
    all the things, from which you could not be justified by the
    law of Moses.</span></li>

    <li><span>In him every one that believeth, is
    justified.</span></li>

    <li><span>Beware, therefore, lest that come upon you which is
    spoken in the prophets:</span></li>

    <li><span>Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I
    work a work in your days, a work which you will not believe, if
    any man shall tell it you.</span></li>

    <li><span>And as they went out, they desired them, that on the
    next sabbath, they would speak unto them these
    words.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the synagogue was broken up, many of the
    Jews, and of the strangers who served God, followed Paul and
    Barnabas: who speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in
    the grace of God.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the next sabbath day, the whole city almost came
    together, to hear the word of God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Jews seeing the multitudes, were filled with
    envy, and contradicted those things which were said by Paul,
    blaspheming.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Paul and Barnabas said boldly: To you it behoved
    us first to speak the word of God: but because you reject it,
    and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold we turn
    to the Gentiles.</span></li>

    <li><span>For so the Lord hath commanded us: I have set thee to
    be the light of the Gentiles; that thou mayest be for salvation
    unto the utmost part of the earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Gentiles hearing it, were glad, and glorified
    the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to life
    everlasting, believed.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the word of the Lord was published throughout the
    whole country.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the Jews stirred up religious and honourable
    women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution
    against Paul and Barnabas: and cast them out of their
    coasts.</span></li>

    <li><span>But they, shaking off the dust of their feet against
    them, came to Iconium.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the disciples were filled with joy and with the
    Holy Ghost.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="14">Acts 14</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And it came to pass in Iconium, that they entered
    together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a
    very great multitude both of the Jews and of the Greeks did
    believe.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the unbelieving Jews stirred up and incensed the
    minds of the Gentiles against the brethren.</span></li>

    <li><span>A long time therefore they abode there, dealing
    confidently in the Lord, who gave testimony to the word of his
    grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their
    hands.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the multitude of the city was divided; and some
    of them indeed held with the Jews, but some with the
    apostles.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when there was an assault made by the Gentiles
    and the Jews with their rulers, to use them contumeliously, and
    to stone them:</span></li>

    <li><span>They understanding it, fled to Lystra, and Derbe,
    cities of Lycaonia, and to the whole country round about, and
    were there preaching the gospel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in
    his feet, a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had
    walked.</span></li>

    <li><span>This same heard Paul speaking. Who looking upon him,
    and seeing that he had faith to be healed,</span></li>

    <li><span>Said with a loud voice: Stand upright on thy feet.
    And he leaped up, and walked.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the multitudes had seen what Paul had done,
    they lifted up their voice in the Lycaonian tongue, saying: The
    gods are come down to us in the likeness of men;</span></li>

    <li><span>And they called Barnabas, Jupiter: but Paul, Mercury;
    because he was chief speaker.</span></li>

    <li><span>The priest also of Jupiter that was before the city,
    bringing oxen and garlands before the gate, would have offered
    sacrifice with the people.</span></li>

    <li><span>Which, when the apostles Barnabas and Paul had heard,
    rending their clothes, they leaped out among the people,
    crying,</span></li>

    <li><span>And saying: Ye men, why do ye these things? We also
    are mortals, men like unto you, preaching to you to be
    converted from these vain things, to the living God, who made
    the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all things that are
    in them:</span></li>

    <li><span>Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in
    their own ways.</span></li>

    <li><span>Nevertheless he left not himself without testimony,
    doing good from heaven, giving rains and fruitful seasons,
    filling our hearts with food and gladness.</span></li>

    <li><span>And speaking these things, they scarce restrained the
    people from sacrificing to them.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now there came thither certain Jews from Antioch, and
    Iconium: and persuading the multitude, and stoning Paul, drew
    him out of the city, thinking him to be dead.</span></li>

    <li><span>But as the disciples stood round about him, he rose
    up and entered into the city, and the next day he departed with
    Barnabas to Derbe.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they had preached the gospel to that city,
    and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to
    Iconium, and to Antioch:</span></li>

    <li><span>Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting
    them to continue in the faith: and that through many
    tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they had ordained to them priests in every
    church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the
    Lord, in whom they believed.</span></li>

    <li><span>And passing through Pisidia, they came into
    Pamphylia.</span></li>

    <li><span>And having spoken the word of the Lord in Perge, they
    went down into Attalia:</span></li>

    <li><span>And thence they sailed to Antioch, from whence they
    had been delivered to the grace of God, unto the work which
    they accomplished.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they were come, and had assembled the
    church, they related what great things God had done with them,
    and how he had opened the door of faith to the
    Gentiles.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they abode no small time with the
    disciples.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="15">Acts 15</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And some coming down from Judea, taught the brethren:
    That except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses, you
    cannot be saved.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Paul and Barnabas had no small contest with
    them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain
    others of the other side, should go up to the apostles and
    priests to Jerusalem about this question.</span></li>

    <li><span>They therefore being brought on their way by the
    church, passed through Phenice, and Samaria, relating the
    conversion of the Gentiles; and they caused great joy to all
    the brethren.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were
    received by the church, and by the apostles and ancients,
    declaring how great things God had done with them.</span></li>

    <li><span>But there arose some of the sect of the Pharisees
    that believed, saying: They must be circumcised, and be
    commanded to observe the law of Moses.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the apostles and ancients assembled to consider
    of this matter.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when there had been much disputing, Peter, rising
    up, said to them: Men, brethren, you know, that in former days
    God made choice among us, that by my mouth the Gentiles should
    hear the word of the gospel, and believe.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God, who knoweth the hearts, gave testimony,
    giving unto them the Holy Ghost, as well as to us;</span></li>

    <li><span>And put no difference between us and them, purifying
    their hearts by faith.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now therefore, why tempt you God to put a yoke upon
    the necks of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we
    have been able to bear?</span></li>

    <li><span>But by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we believe
    to be saved, in like manner as they also.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the multitude held their peace; and they
    heard Barnabas and Paul telling what great signs and wonders
    God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And after they had held their peace, James answered,
    saying: Men, brethren, hear me.</span></li>

    <li><span>Simon hath related how God first visited to take of
    the Gentiles a people to his name.</span></li>

    <li><span>And to this agree the words of the prophets, as it is
    written:</span></li>

    <li><span>After these things I will return, and will rebuild
    the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and the ruins
    thereof I will rebuild, and I will set it up:</span></li>

    <li><span>That the residue of men may seek after the Lord, and
    all nations upon whom my name is invoked, saith the Lord, who
    doth these things.</span></li>

    <li><span>To the Lord was his own work known from the beginning
    of the world.</span></li>

    <li><span>For which cause I judge that they, who from among the
    Gentiles are converted to God, are not to be
    disquieted.</span></li>

    <li><span>But that we write unto them, that they refrain
    themselves from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication,
    and from things strangled, and from blood.</span></li>

    <li><span>For Moses of old time hath in every city them that
    preach him in the synagogues, where he is read every
    sabbath.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then it pleased the apostles and ancients, with the
    whole church, to choose men of their own company, and to send
    to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas, namely, Judas, who was
    surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the
    brethren.</span></li>

    <li><span>Writing by their hands: The apostles and ancients,
    brethren, to the brethren of the Gentiles that are at Antioch,
    and in Syria and Cilicia, greeting.</span></li>

    <li><span>Forasmuch as we have heard, that some going out from
    us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls; to whom
    we gave no commandment:</span></li>

    <li><span>It hath seemed good to us, being assembled together,
    to choose out men, and to send them unto you, with our well
    beloved Barnabas and Paul:</span></li>

    <li><span>Men that have given their lives for the name of our
    Lord Jesus Christ.</span></li>

    <li><span>We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who
    themselves also will, by word of mouth, tell you the same
    things.</span></li>

    <li><span>For it hath seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us,
    to lay no further burden upon you than these necessary
    things:</span></li>

    <li><span>That you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and
    from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication;
    from which things keeping yourselves, you shall do well. Fare
    ye well.</span></li>

    <li><span>They therefore being dismissed, went down to Antioch;
    and gathering together the multitude, delivered the
    epistle.</span></li>

    <li><span>Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the
    consolation.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves,
    with many words comforted the brethren, and confirmed
    them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And after they had spent some time there, they were
    let go with peace by the brethren, unto them that had sent
    them.</span></li>

    <li><span>But it seemed good unto Silas to remain there; and
    Judas alone departed to Jerusalem.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Paul and Barnabas continued at Antioch, teaching
    and preaching, with many others, the word of the
    Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And after some days, Paul said to Barnabas: Let us
    return and visit our brethren in all the cities wherein we have
    preached the word of the Lord, to see how they do.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Barnabas would have taken with them John also,
    that was surnamed Mark;</span></li>

    <li><span>But Paul desired that he (as having departed from
    them out of Pamphylia, and not gone with them to the work)
    might not be received.</span></li>

    <li><span>And there arose a dissension, so that they departed
    one from another; and Barnabas indeed taking Mark, sailed to
    Cyprus.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Paul choosing Silas, departed, being delivered by
    the brethren to the grace of God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the
    churches, commanding them to keep the precepts of the apostles
    and the ancients.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="16">Acts 16</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And he came to Derbe and Lystra. And behold, there
    was a certain disciple there named Timothy, the son of a Jewish
    woman that believed; but his father was a Gentile.</span></li>

    <li><span>To this man the brethren that were in Lystra and
    Iconium, gave a good testimony.</span></li>

    <li><span>Him Paul would have to go along with him: and taking
    him he circumcised him, because of the Jews who were in those
    places. For they all knew that his father was a
    Gentile.</span></li>

    <li><span>And as they passed through the cities, they delivered
    unto them the decrees for to keep, that were decreed by the
    apostles and ancients who were at Jerusalem.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the churches were confirmed in faith, and
    increased in number daily.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they had passed through Phrygia, and the
    country of Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy Ghost to
    preach the word in Asia.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they were come into Mysia, they attempted to
    go into Bythynia, and the Spirit of Jesus suffered them
    not.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they had passed through Mysia, they went
    down to Troas.</span></li>

    <li><span>And a vision was shewed to Paul in the night, which
    was a man of Macedonia standing and beseeching him, and saying:
    Pass over into Macedonia, and help us.</span></li>

    <li><span>And as soon as he had seen the vision, immediately we
    sought to go into Macedonia, being assured that God had called
    us to preach the gospel to them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And sailing from Troas, we came with a straight
    course to Samothracia, and the day following to
    Neapolis;</span></li>

    <li><span>And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city
    of part of Macedonia, a colony. And we were in this city some
    days conferring together.</span></li>

    <li><span>And upon the sabbath day, we went forth without the
    gate by a river side, where it seemed that there was prayer;
    and sitting down, we spoke to the women that were
    assembled.</span></li>

    <li><span>And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple,
    of the city of Thyatira, one that worshipped God, did hear:
    whose heart the Lord opened to attend to those things which
    were said by Paul.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when she was baptized, and her household, she
    besought us, saying: If you have judged me to be faithful to
    the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she
    constrained us.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain
    girl, having a pythonical spirit, met us, who brought to her
    masters much gain by divining.</span></li>

    <li><span>This same following Paul and us, cried out, saying:
    These men are the servants of the most high God, who preach
    unto you the way of salvation.</span></li>

    <li><span>And this she did many days. But Paul being grieved,
    turned, and said to the spirit: I command thee, in the name of
    Jesus Christ, to go out from her. And he went out the same
    hour.</span></li>

    <li><span>But her masters, seeing that the hope of their gain
    was gone, apprehending Paul and Silas, brought them into the
    marketplace to the rulers.</span></li>

    <li><span>And presenting them to the magistrates, they said:
    These men disturb our city, being Jews;</span></li>

    <li><span>And preach a fashion which it is not lawful for us to
    receive nor observe, being Romans.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the people ran together against them; and the
    magistrates rending off their clothes, commanded them to be
    beaten with rods.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they
    cast them into prison, charging the gaoler to keep them
    diligently.</span></li>

    <li><span>Who having received such a charge, thrust them into
    the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the
    stocks.</span></li>

    <li><span>And at midnight, Paul and Silas praying, praised God.
    And they that were in prison, heard them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that
    the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all
    the doors were opened, and the bands of all were
    loosed.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the keeper of the prison, awaking out of his
    sleep, and seeing the doors of the prison open, drawing his
    sword, would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners
    had been fled.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying: Do thyself
    no harm, for we all are here.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then calling for a light, he went in, and trembling,
    fell down at the feet of Paul and Silas.</span></li>

    <li><span>And bringing them out, he said: Masters, what must I
    do, that I may be saved?</span></li>

    <li><span>But they said: Believe in the Lord Jesus, and thou
    shalt be saved, and thy house.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they preached the word of the Lord to him and to
    all that were in his house.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he, taking them the same hour of the night,
    washed their stripes, and himself was baptized, and all his
    house immediately.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had brought them into his own house, he
    laid the table for them, and rejoiced with all his house,
    believing God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the day was come, the magistrates sent the
    serjeants, saying, Let those men go.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the keeper of the prison told these words to
    Paul: The magistrates have sent to let you go; now therefore
    depart, and go in peace.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Paul said to them: They have beaten us publicly,
    uncondemned, men that are Romans, and have cast us into prison:
    and now do they thrust us out privately? Not so; but let them
    come,</span></li>

    <li><span>And let us out themselves. And the serjeants told
    these words to the magistrates. And they were afraid, hearing
    that they were Romans.</span></li>

    <li><span>And coming, they besought them; and bringing them
    out, they desired them to depart out of the city.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they went out of the prison, and entered into the
    house of Lydia; and having seen the brethren, they comforted
    them, and departed.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="17">Acts 17</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And when they had passed through Amphipolis and
    Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a
    synagogue of the Jews.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Paul, according to his custom, went in unto them;
    and for three sabbath days he reasoned with them out of the
    scriptures:</span></li>

    <li><span>Declaring and insinuating that the Christ was to
    suffer, and to rise again from the dead; and that this is Jesus
    Christ, whom I preach to you.</span></li>

    <li><span>And some of them believed, and were associated to
    Paul and Silas; and of those that served God, and of the
    Gentiles a great multitude, and of noble women not a
    few.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the Jews, moved with envy, and taking unto them
    some wicked men of the vulgar sort, and making a tumult, set
    the city in an uproar; and besetting Jason's house, sought to
    bring them out unto the people.</span></li>

    <li><span>And not finding them, they drew Jason and certain
    brethren to the rulers of the city, crying: They that set the
    city in an uproar, are come hither also;</span></li>

    <li><span>Whom Jason hath received; and these all do contrary
    to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king,
    Jesus.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they stirred up the people, and the rulers of the
    city hearing these things,</span></li>

    <li><span>And having taken satisfaction of Jason and of the
    rest, they let them go.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas
    by night unto Berea. Who, when they were come thither, went
    into the synagogue of the Jews.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica,
    who received the word with all eagerness, daily searching the
    scriptures, whether these things were so.</span></li>

    <li><span>And many indeed of them believed, and of honourable
    women that were Gentiles, and of men not a few.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that
    the word of God was also preached by Paul at Berea, they came
    thither also, stirring up and troubling the
    multitude.</span></li>

    <li><span>And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul, to
    go unto the sea; but Silas and Timothy remained
    there.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they that conducted Paul, brought him as far as
    Athens; and receiving a commandment from him to Silas and
    Timothy, that they should come to him with all speed, they
    departed.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now whilst Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit
    was stirred within him, seeing the city wholly given to
    idolatry.</span></li>

    <li><span>He disputed, therefore, in the synagogue with the
    Jews, and with them that served God, and in the marketplace,
    every day with them that were there.</span></li>

    <li><span>And certain philosophers of the Epicureans and of the
    Stoics disputed with him; and some said: What is it, that this
    word sower would say? But others: He seemeth to be a setter
    forth of new gods; because he preached to them Jesus and the
    resurrection.</span></li>

    <li><span>And taking him, they brought him to the Areopagus,
    saying: May we know what this new doctrine is, which thou
    speakest of?</span></li>

    <li><span>For thou bringest in certain new things to our ears.
    We would know therefore what these things mean.</span></li>

    <li><span>(Now all the Athenians, and strangers that were
    there, employed themselves in nothing else, but either in
    telling or in hearing some new thing.)</span></li>

    <li><span>But Paul standing in the midst of the Areopagus,
    said: Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are
    too superstitious.</span></li>

    <li><span>For passing by, and seeing your idols, I found an
    altar also, on which was written: To the unknown God. What
    therefore you worship, without knowing it, that I preach to
    you:</span></li>

    <li><span>God, who made the world, and all things therein; he,
    being Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made
    with hands;</span></li>

    <li><span>Neither is he served with men's hands, as though he
    needed any thing; seeing it is he who giveth to all life, and
    breath, and all things:</span></li>

    <li><span>And hath made of one, all mankind, to dwell upon the
    whole face of the earth, determining appointed times, and the
    limits of their habitation.</span></li>

    <li><span>That they should seek God, if happily they may feel
    after him or find him, although he be not far from every one of
    us:</span></li>

    <li><span>For in him we live, and move, and are; as some also
    of your own poets said: For we are also his
    offspring.</span></li>

    <li><span>Being therefore the offspring of God, we must not
    suppose the divinity to be like unto gold, or silver, or stone,
    the graving of art, and device of man.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God indeed having winked at the times of this
    ignorance, now declareth unto men, that all should every where
    do penance.</span></li>

    <li><span>Because he hath appointed a day wherein he will judge
    the world in equity, by the man whom he hath appointed; giving
    faith to all, by raising him up from the dead.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they had heard of the resurrection of the
    dead, some indeed mocked, but others said: We will hear thee
    again concerning this matter.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Paul went out from among them.</span></li>

    <li><span>But certain men adhering to him, did believe; among
    whom was also Dionysius, the Areopagite, and a woman named
    Damaris, and others with them.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="18">Acts 18</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>After these things, departing from Athens, he came to
    Corinth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And finding a certain Jew, named Aquila, born in
    Pontus, lately come from Italy, with Priscilla his wife,
    (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from
    Rome,) he came to them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And because he was of the same trade, he remained
    with them, and wrought; (now they were tentmakers by
    trade.)</span></li>

    <li><span>And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath,
    bringing in the name of the Lord Jesus; and he persuaded the
    Jews and the Greeks.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Silas and Timothy were come from Macedonia,
    Paul was earnest in preaching, testifying to the Jews, that
    Jesus is the Christ.</span></li>

    <li><span>But they gainsaying and blaspheming, he shook his
    garments, and said to them: Your blood be upon your own heads;
    I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the
    Gentiles.</span></li>

    <li><span>And departing thence, he entered into the house of a
    certain man, named Titus Justus, one that worshipped God, whose
    house was adjoining to the synagogue.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in
    the Lord, with all his house; and many of the Corinthians
    hearing, believed, and were baptized.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Paul in the nights, by a vision:
    Do not fear, but speak; and hold not thy peace,</span></li>

    <li><span>Because I am with thee: and no man shall set upon
    thee, to hurt thee; for I have much people in this
    city.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he stayed there a year and six months, teaching
    among them the word of God.</span></li>

    <li><span>But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews
    with one accord rose up against Paul, and brought him to the
    judgment seat,</span></li>

    <li><span>Saying: This man persuadeth men to worship God
    contrary to the law.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Paul was beginning to open his mouth, Gallio
    said to the Jews: If it were some matter of injustice, or an
    heinous deed, O Jews, I should with reason bear with
    you.</span></li>

    <li><span>But if they be questions of word and names, and of
    your law, look you to it: I will not be judge of such
    things.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he drove them from the judgment seat.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all laying hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the
    synagogue, beat him before the judgment seat; and Gallio cared
    for none of those things.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Paul, when he had stayed yet many days, taking
    his leave of the brethren, sailed thence into Syria (and with
    him Priscilla and Aquila), having shorn his head in Cenchrae:
    for he had a vow.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he came to Ephesus, and left them there. But he
    himself entering into the synagogue, disputed with the
    Jews.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they desired him, that he would tarry a
    longer time, he consented not;</span></li>

    <li><span>But taking his leave, and saying: I will return to
    you again, God willing, he departed from Ephesus.</span></li>

    <li><span>And going down to Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem,
    and saluted the church, and so came down to
    Antioch.</span></li>

    <li><span>And after he had spent some time there, he departed,
    and went through the country of Galatia and Phrygia, in order,
    confirming all the disciples.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now a certain Jew, named Apollo, born at Alexandria,
    an eloquent man, came to Ephesus, one mighty in the
    scriptures.</span></li>

    <li><span>This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and
    being fervent in spirit, spoke, and taught diligently the
    things that are of Jesus, knowing only the baptism of
    John.</span></li>

    <li><span>This man therefore began to speak boldly in the
    synagogue. Whom when Priscilla and Aquila had heard, they took
    him to them, and expounded to him the way of the Lord more
    diligently.</span></li>

    <li><span>And whereas he was desirous to go to Achaia, the
    brethren exhorting, wrote to the disciples to receive him. Who,
    when he was come, helped them much who had
    believed.</span></li>

    <li><span>For with much vigour he convinced the Jews openly,
    shewing by the scriptures, that Jesus is the
    Christ.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="19">Acts 19</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And it came to pass, while Apollo was at Corinth,
    that Paul having passed through the upper coasts, came to
    Ephesus, and found certain disciples.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to them: Have you received the Holy Ghost
    since ye believed? But they said to him: We have not so much as
    heard whether there be a Holy Ghost.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said: In what then were you baptized? Who
    said: In John's baptism.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Paul said: John baptized the people with the
    baptism of penance, saying: That they should believe in him who
    was to come after him, that is to say, in Jesus.</span></li>

    <li><span>Having heard these things, they were baptized in the
    name of the Lord Jesus.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Paul had imposed his hands on them, the Holy
    Ghost came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and
    prophesied.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the men were about twelve.</span></li>

    <li><span>And entering into the synagogue, he spoke boldly for
    the space of three months, disputing and exhorting concerning
    the kingdom of God.</span></li>

    <li><span>But when some were hardened, and believed not,
    speaking evil of the way of the Lord, before the multitude,
    departing from them, he separated the disciples, disputing
    daily in the school of one Tyrannus.</span></li>

    <li><span>And this continued for the space of two years, so
    that all they who dwelt in Asia, heard the word of the Lord,
    both Jews and Gentiles.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God wrought by the hand of Paul more than common
    miracles.</span></li>

    <li><span>So that even there were brought from his body to the
    sick, handkerchiefs and aprons, and the diseases departed from
    them, and the wicked spirits went out of them.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now some also of the Jewish exorcists who went about,
    attempted to invoke over them that had evil spirits, the name
    of the Lord Jesus, saying: I conjure you by Jesus, whom Paul
    preacheth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And there were certain men, seven sons of Sceva, a
    Jew, a chief priest, that did this.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the wicked spirit, answering, said to them: Jesus
    I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?</span></li>

    <li><span>And the man in whom the wicked spirit was, leaping
    upon them, and mastering them both, prevailed against them, so
    that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</span></li>

    <li><span>And this became known to all the Jews and the
    Gentiles that dwelt at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and
    the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</span></li>

    <li><span>And many of them that believed, came confessing and
    declaring their deeds.</span></li>

    <li><span>And many of them who had followed curious arts,
    brought together their books, and burnt them before all; and
    counting the price of them, they found the money to be fifty
    thousand pieces of silver.</span></li>

    <li><span>So mightily grew the word of God, and was
    confirmed.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when these things were ended, Paul purposed in
    the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to
    go to Jerusalem, saying: After I have been there, I must see
    Rome also.</span></li>

    <li><span>And sending into Macedonia two of them that
    ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself remained for
    a time in Asia.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now at that time there arose no small disturbance
    about the way of the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who
    made silver temples for Diana, brought no small gain to the
    craftsmen;</span></li>

    <li><span>Whom he calling together, with the workmen of like
    occupation, said: Sirs, you know that our gain is by this
    trade;</span></li>

    <li><span>And you see and hear, that this Paul by persuasion
    hath drawn away a great multitude, not only of Ephesus, but
    almost of all Asia, saying: They are not gods which are made by
    hands.</span></li>

    <li><span>So that not only this our craft is in danger to be
    set at nought, but also the temple of great Diana shall be
    reputed for nothing; yea, and her majesty shall begin to be
    destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.</span></li>

    <li><span>Having heard these things, they were full of anger,
    and cried out, saying: Great is Diana of the
    Ephesians.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the whole city was filled with confusion; and
    having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's
    companions, they rushed with one accord into the
    theatre.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Paul would have entered in unto the people,
    the disciples suffered him not.</span></li>

    <li><span>And some also of the rulers of Asia, who were his
    friends, sent unto him, desiring that he would not venture
    himself into the theatre.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now some cried one thing, some another. For the
    assembly was confused, and the greater part knew not for what
    cause they were come together.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they drew forth Alexander out of the multitude,
    the Jews thrusting him forward. And Alexander beckoning with
    his hand for silence, would have given the people
    satisfaction.</span></li>

    <li><span>But as soon as they perceived him to be a Jew, all
    with one voice, for the space of about two hours, cried out:
    Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the town clerk had appeased the multitudes,
    he said: Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not
    that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great
    Diana, and of Jupiter's offspring.</span></li>

    <li><span>For as much therefore as these things cannot be
    contradicted, you ought to be quiet, and to do nothing
    rashly.</span></li>

    <li><span>For you have brought hither these men, who are
    neither guilty of sacrilege, nor of blasphemy against your
    goddess.</span></li>

    <li><span>But if Demetrius and the craftsmen that are with him,
    have a matter against any man, the courts of justice are open,
    and there are proconsuls: let them accuse one
    another.</span></li>

    <li><span>And if you inquire after any other matter, it may be
    decided in a lawful assembly.</span></li>

    <li><span>For we are even in danger to be called in question
    for this day's uproar, there being no man guilty (of whom we
    may give account) of this concourse. And when he had said these
    things, he dismissed the assembly.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="20">Acts 20</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And after the tumult was ceased, Paul calling to him
    the disciples, and exhorting them, took his leave, and set
    forward to go into Macedonia.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had gone over those parts, and had
    exhorted them with many words, he came into Greece;</span></li>

    <li><span>Where, when he had spent three months, the Jews laid
    wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria; so he took a
    resolution to return through Macedonia.</span></li>

    <li><span>And there accompanied him Sopater the son of Pyrrhus,
    of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus, and Secundus,
    and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and
    Trophimus.</span></li>

    <li><span>These going before, stayed for us at
    Troas.</span></li>

    <li><span>But we sailed from Philippi after the days of the
    Azymes, and came to them to Troas in five days, where we abode
    seven days.</span></li>

    <li><span>And on the first day of the week, when we were
    assembled to break bread, Paul discoursed with them, being to
    depart on the morrow: and he continued his speech until
    midnight.</span></li>

    <li><span>And there were a great number of lamps in the upper
    chamber where we were assembled.</span></li>

    <li><span>And a certain young man named Eutychus, sitting on
    the window, being oppressed with a deep sleep, (as Paul was
    long preaching,) by occasion of his sleep fell from the third
    loft down, and was taken up dead.</span></li>

    <li><span>To whom, when Paul had gone down, he laid himself
    upon him, and embracing him, said: Be not troubled, for his
    soul is in him.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then going up, and breaking bread and tasting, and
    having talked a long time to them, until daylight, so he
    departed.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they brought the youth alive, and were not a
    little comforted.</span></li>

    <li><span>But we, going aboard the ship, sailed to Assos, being
    there to take in Paul; for so he had appointed, himself
    purposing to travel by land.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had met with us at Assos, we took him in,
    and came to Mitylene.</span></li>

    <li><span>And sailing thence, the day following we came over
    against Chios; and the next day we arrived at Samos; and the
    day following we came to Miletus.</span></li>

    <li><span>For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, lest he
    should be stayed any time in Asia. For he hasted, if it were
    possible for him, to keep the day of Pentecost at
    Jerusalem.</span></li>

    <li><span>And sending from Miletus to Ephesus, he called the
    ancients of the church.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they were come to him, and were together, he
    said to them: You know from the first day that I came into
    Asia, in what manner I have been with you, for all the
    time,</span></li>

    <li><span>Serving the Lord with all humility, and with tears,
    and temptations which befell me by the conspiracies of the
    Jews;</span></li>

    <li><span>How I have kept back nothing that was profitable to
    you, but have preached it to you, and taught you publicly, and
    from house to house,</span></li>

    <li><span>Testifying both to Jews and Gentiles penance towards
    God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></li>

    <li><span>And now, behold, being bound in the spirit, I go to
    Jerusalem: not knowing the things which shall befall me
    there:</span></li>

    <li><span>Save that the Holy Ghost in every city witnesseth to
    me, saying: That bands and afflictions wait for me at
    Jerusalem.</span></li>

    <li><span>But I fear none of these things, neither do I count
    my life more precious than myself, so that I may consummate my
    course and the ministry of the word which I received from the
    Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of
    God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And now behold, I know that all you, among whom I
    have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no
    more.</span></li>

    <li><span>Wherefore I take you to witness this day, that I am
    clear from the blood of all men;</span></li>

    <li><span>For I have not spared to declare unto you all the
    counsel of God.</span></li>

    <li><span>Take heed to yourselves, and to the whole flock,
    wherein the Holy Ghost hath placed you bishops, to rule the
    church of God, which he hath purchased with his own
    blood.</span></li>

    <li><span>I know that, after my departure, ravening wolves will
    enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</span></li>

    <li><span>And of your own selves shall arise men speaking
    perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.</span></li>

    <li><span>Therefore watch, keeping in memory, that for three
    years I ceased not, with tears to admonish every one of you
    night and day.</span></li>

    <li><span>And now I commend you to God, and to the word of his
    grace, who is able to build up, and to give an inheritance
    among all the sanctified.</span></li>

    <li><span>I have not coveted any man's silver, gold, or
    apparel, as</span></li>

    <li><span>You yourselves know: for such things as were needful
    for me and them that are with me, these hands have
    furnished.</span></li>

    <li><span>I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring
    you ought to support the weak, and to remember the word of the
    Lord Jesus, how he said: It is a more blessed thing to give,
    rather than to receive.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had said these things, kneeling down, he
    prayed with them all.</span></li>

    <li><span>And there was much weeping among them all; and
    falling on the neck of Paul, they kissed him,</span></li>

    <li><span>Being grieved most of all for the word which he had
    said, that they should see his face no more. And they brought
    him on his way to the ship.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="21">Acts 21</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And when it came to pass that, being parted from
    them, we set sail, we came with a straight course to Coos, and
    the day following to Rhodes, and from thence to
    Patara.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when we had found a ship sailing over to Phenice,
    we went aboard, and set forth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when we had discovered Cyprus, leaving it on the
    left hand, we sailed into Syria, and came to Tyre: for there
    the ship was to unlade her burden.</span></li>

    <li><span>And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days:
    who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up
    to Jerusalem.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the days being expired, departing we went
    forward, they all bringing us on our way, with their wives and
    children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on
    the shore, and we prayed.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when we had bid one another farewell, we took
    ship; and they returned home.</span></li>

    <li><span>But we having finished the voyage by sea, from Tyre
    came down to Ptolemais: and saluting the brethren, we abode one
    day with them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the next day departing, we came to Caesarea. And
    entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one
    of the seven, we abode with him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he had four daughters, virgins, who did
    prophesy.</span></li>

    <li><span>And as we tarried there for some days, there came
    from Judea a certain prophet, named Agabus.</span></li>

    <li><span>Who, when he was come to us, took Paul's girdle: and
    binding his own feet and hands, he said: Thus saith the Holy
    Ghost: The man whose girdle this is, the Jews shall bind in
    this manner in Jerusalem, and shall deliver him into the hands
    of the Gentiles.</span></li>

    <li><span>Which when we had heard, both we and they that were
    of that place, desired him that he would not go up to
    Jerusalem.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Paul answered, and said: What do you mean
    weeping and afflicting my heart? For I am ready not only to be
    bound, but to die also in Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord
    Jesus.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when we could not persuade him, we ceased,
    saying: The will of the Lord be done.</span></li>

    <li><span>And after those days, being prepared, we went up to
    Jerusalem.</span></li>

    <li><span>And there went also with us some of the disciples
    from Caesarea, bringing with them one Mnason a Cyprian, an old
    disciple, with whom we should lodge.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren
    received us gladly.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the day following, Paul went in with us unto
    James; and all the ancients were assembled.</span></li>

    <li><span>Whom when he had saluted, he related particularly
    what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his
    ministry.</span></li>

    <li><span>But they hearing it, glorified God, and said to him:
    Thou seest, brother, how many thousands there are among the
    Jews that have believed: and they are all zealous for the
    law.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now they have heard of thee that thou teachest those
    Jews, who are among the Gentiles, to depart from Moses: saying,
    that they ought not to circumcise their children, nor walk
    according to the custom.</span></li>

    <li><span>What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come
    together: for they will hear that thou art come.</span></li>

    <li><span>Do therefore this that we say to thee. We have four
    men, who have a vow on them.</span></li>

    <li><span>Take these, and sanctify thyself with them: and
    bestow on them, that they may shave their heads: and all will
    know that the things which they have heard of thee, are false;
    but that thou thyself also walkest keeping the law.</span></li>

    <li><span>But as touching the Gentiles that believe, we have
    written, decreeing that they should only refrain themselves
    from that which has been offered to idols, and from blood, and
    from things strangles, and from fornication.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Paul took the men, and the next day being
    purified with them, entered into the temple, giving notice of
    the accomplishment of the days of purification, until an
    oblation should be offered for every one of them.</span></li>

    <li><span>But when the seven days were drawing to an end, those
    Jews that were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple,
    stirred up all the people, and laid hands upon him, crying
    out:</span></li>

    <li><span>Men of Israel, help: This is the man that teacheth
    all men every where against the people, and the law, and this
    place; and moreover hath brought in Gentiles into the temple,
    and hath violated this holy place.</span></li>

    <li><span>(For they had seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city
    with him, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the
    temple.)</span></li>

    <li><span>And the whole city was in an uproar: and the people
    ran together. And taking Paul, they drew him out of the temple,
    and immediately the doors were shut.</span></li>

    <li><span>And as they went about to kill him, it was told the
    tribune of the band, That all Jerusalem was in
    confusion.</span></li>

    <li><span>Who, forthwith taking with him soldiers and
    centurions, ran down to them. And when they saw the tribune and
    the soldiers they left off beating Paul.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then the tribune coming near, took him, and commanded
    him to be bound with two chains: and demanded who he was, and
    what he had done.</span></li>

    <li><span>And some cried one thing, some another, among the
    multitude. And when he could not know the certainty for the
    tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the
    castle.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he was come to the stairs, it fell out that
    he was carried by the soldiers, because of the violence of the
    people.</span></li>

    <li><span>For the multitude of the people followed after,
    crying: Away with him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And as Paul was about to be brought into the castle,
    he saith to the tribune: May speak something to thee? Who said:
    Canst thou speak Greek?</span></li>

    <li><span>Art not thou that Egyptian who before these days
    didst raise a tumult, and didst lead forth into the desert four
    thousand men that were murderers?</span></li>

    <li><span>But Paul said to him: I am a Jew of Tarsus in
    Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city. And I beseech thee, suffer
    me to speak to the people.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had given him leave, Paul standing on the
    stairs, beckoned with his hand to the people. And a great
    silence being made, he spoke unto them in the Hebrew tongue,
    saying:</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="22">Acts 22</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye the account which
    I now give unto you.</span></li>

    <li><span>(And when they heard that he spoke to them in the
    Hebrew tongue, they kept the more silence.)</span></li>

    <li><span>And he saith: I am a Jew, born at Tarsus in Cilicia,
    but brought up in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, taught
    according to the truth of the law of the fathers, zealous for
    the law, as also all you are this day:</span></li>

    <li><span>Who persecuted this way unto death, binding and
    delivering into prisons both men and women.</span></li>

    <li><span>As the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the
    ancients: from whom also receiving letters to the brethren, I
    went to Damascus, that I might bring them bound from thence to
    Jerusalem to be punished.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it came to pass, as I was going, and drawing nigh
    to Damascus at midday, that suddenly from heaven there shone
    round about me a great light:</span></li>

    <li><span>And falling on the ground, I heard a voice saying to
    me: Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</span></li>

    <li><span>And I answered: Who art thou, Lord? And he said to
    me: I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they that were with me, saw indeed the light, but
    they heard not the voice of him that spoke with me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I said: What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said
    to me: Arise, and go to Damascus; and there it shall be told
    thee of all things that thou must do.</span></li>

    <li><span>And whereas I did not see for the brightness of that
    light, being led by the hand by my companions, I came to
    Damascus.</span></li>

    <li><span>And one Ananias, a man according to the law, having
    testimony of all the Jews who dwelt there,</span></li>

    <li><span>Coming to me, and standing by me, said to me: Brother
    Saul, look up. And I the same hour looked upon him.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he said: The God of our fathers hath preordained
    thee that thou shouldst know his will, and see the Just One,
    and shouldst hear the voice from his mouth.</span></li>

    <li><span>For thou shalt be his witness to all men, of those
    things which thou hast seen and heard.</span></li>

    <li><span>And now why tarriest thou? Rise up, and be baptized,
    and wash away thy sins, invoking his name.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it came to pass, when I was come again to
    Jerusalem, and was praying in the temple, that I was in a
    trance,</span></li>

    <li><span>And saw him saying unto me: Make haste, and get thee
    quickly out of Jerusalem; because they will not receive thy
    testimony concerning me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I said: Lord, they know that I cast into prison,
    and beat in every synagogue, them that believed in
    thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the blood of Stephen thy witness was shed, I
    stood by and consented, and kept the garments of them that
    killed him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to me: Go, for unto the Gentiles afar
    off, will I send thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they heard him until this word, and then lifted
    up their voice, saying: Away with such an one from the earth;
    for it is not fit that he should live.</span></li>

    <li><span>And as they cried out and threw off their garments,
    and cast dust into the air,</span></li>

    <li><span>The tribune commanded him to be brought into the
    castle, and that he should be scourged and tortured: to know
    for what cause they did so cry out against him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they had bound him with thongs, Paul saith
    to the centurion that stood by him: Is it lawful for you to
    scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?</span></li>

    <li><span>Which the centurion hearing, went to the tribune, and
    told him, saying: What art thou about to do? For this man is a
    Roman citizen.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the tribune coming, said to him: Tell me, art
    thou a Roman? But he said: Yea.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the tribune answered: I obtained the being free
    of this city with a great sum. And Paul said: But I was born
    so.</span></li>

    <li><span>Immediately therefore they departed from him that
    were about to torture him. The tribune also was afraid after he
    understood that he was a Roman citizen, and because he had
    bound him.</span></li>

    <li><span>But on the next day, meaning to know more diligently
    for what cause he was accused by the Jews, he loosed him, and
    commanded the priests to come together, and all the council:
    and bringing forth Paul, he set him before them.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="23">Acts 23</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And Paul looking upon the council, said: Men,
    brethren, I have conversed with all good conscience before God
    until this present day.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood
    by him to strike him on the mouth.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Paul said to him: God shall strike thee, thou
    whited wall. For sittest thou to judge me according to the law,
    and contrary to the law commandest me to be struck?</span></li>

    <li><span>And they that stood by said: Dost thou revile the
    high priest of God?</span></li>

    <li><span>And Paul said: I knew not, brethren, that he is the
    high priest. For it is written: Thou shalt not speak evil of
    the prince of thy people.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Paul knowing that the one part were Sadducees,
    and the other Pharisees, cried out in the council: Men,
    brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of Pharisees: concerning the
    hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in
    question.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had so said, there arose a dissension
    between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and the multitude was
    divided.</span></li>

    <li><span>For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection,
    neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess
    both.</span></li>

    <li><span>And there arose a great cry. And some of the
    Pharisees rising up, strove, saying: We find no evil in this
    man. What if a spirit hath spoken to him, or an
    angel?</span></li>

    <li><span>And when there arose a great dissension, the tribune
    fearing lest Paul should be pulled in pieces by them, commanded
    the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among
    them, and to bring him into the castle.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the night following the Lord standing by him,
    said: Be constant; for as thou hast testified of me in
    Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when day was come, some of the Jews gathered
    together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying, that they
    would neither eat, nor drink, till they killed
    Paul.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they were more than forty men that had made this
    conspiracy.</span></li>

    <li><span>Who came to the chief priests and the ancients, and
    said: We have bound ourselves under a great curse that we will
    eat nothing till we have slain Paul.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now therefore do you with the council signify to the
    tribune, that he bring him forth to you, as if you meant to
    know something more certain touching him. And we, before he
    come near, are ready to kill him.</span></li>

    <li><span>Which when Paul's sister's son had heard, of their
    lying in wait, he came and entered into the castle and told
    Paul.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Paul, calling to him one of the centurions, said:
    Bring this young man to the tribune, for he hath some thing to
    tell him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he taking him, brought him to the tribune, and
    said: Paul, the prisoner, desired me to bring this young man
    unto thee, who hath some thing to say to thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the tribune taking him by the hand, went aside
    with him privately, and asked him: What is it that thou hast to
    tell me?</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said: The Jews have agreed to desire thee,
    that thou wouldst bring forth Paul to morrow into the council,
    as if they meant to inquire some thing more certain touching
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>But do not thou give credit to them; for there lie in
    wait for him more than forty men of them, who have bound
    themselves by oath neither to eat, nor to drink, till they have
    killed him: and they are now ready, looking for a promise from
    thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>The tribune therefore dismissed the young man,
    charging him that he should tell no man, that he had made known
    these things unto him.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then having called two centurions, he said to them:
    Make ready two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, and
    seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen for the third hour
    of the night:</span></li>

    <li><span>And provide beasts, that they may set Paul on, and
    bring him safe to Felix the governor.</span></li>

    <li><span>(For he feared lest perhaps the Jews might take him
    away by force and kill him, and he should afterwards be
    slandered, as if he was to take money.) And he wrote a letter
    after this manner:</span></li>

    <li><span>Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor,
    Felix, greeting.</span></li>

    <li><span>This man being taken by the Jews, and ready to be
    killed by them, I rescued coming in with an army, understanding
    that he is a Roman:</span></li>

    <li><span>And meaning to know the cause which they objected
    unto him, I brought him forth into their council.</span></li>

    <li><span>Whom I found to be accused concerning questions of
    their law; but having nothing laid to his charge worthy of
    death or of bands.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when I was told of ambushes that they had
    prepared for him, I sent him to thee, signifying also to his
    accusers to plead before thee. Farewell.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then the soldiers, according as it was commanded
    them, taking Paul, brought him by night to
    Antipatris.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the next day, leaving the horsemen to go with
    him, they returned to the castle.</span></li>

    <li><span>Who, when they were come to Caesarea, and had
    delivered the letter to the governor, did also present Paul
    before him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had read it, and had asked of what
    province he was, and understood that he was of
    Cilicia;</span></li>

    <li><span>I will hear thee, said he, when thy accusers come.
    And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment
    hall.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="24">Acts 24</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And after five days the high priest Ananias came
    down, with some of the ancients, and one Tertullus an orator,
    who went to the governor against Paul.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Paul being called for, Tertullus began to accuse
    him, saying: Whereas through thee we live in much peace, and
    many things are rectified by thy providence,</span></li>

    <li><span>We accept it always and in all places, most excellent
    Felix, with all thanksgiving.</span></li>

    <li><span>But that I be no further tedious to thee, I desire
    thee of thy clemency to hear us in few words.</span></li>

    <li><span>We have found this to be a pestilent man, and raising
    seditions among all the Jews throughout the world, and author
    of the sedition of the sect of the Nazarenes.</span></li>

    <li><span>Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom,
    we having apprehended, would also have judged according to our
    law.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Lysias the tribune coming upon us, with great
    violence took him away out of our hands;</span></li>

    <li><span>Commanding his accusers to come to thee: of whom thou
    mayest thyself, by examination, have knowledge of all these
    things, whereof we accuse him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Jews also added, and said that these things
    were so.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Paul answered, (the governor making a sign to
    him to speak:) Knowing that for many years thou hast been judge
    over this nation, I will with good courage answer for
    myself.</span></li>

    <li><span>For thou mayest understand, that there are yet but
    twelve days, since I went up to adore in Jerusalem:</span></li>

    <li><span>And neither in the temple did they find me disputing
    with any man, or causing any concourse of the people, neither
    in the synagogues, nor in the city:</span></li>

    <li><span>Neither can they prove unto thee the things whereof
    they now accuse me.</span></li>

    <li><span>But this I confess to thee, that according to the
    way, which they call a heresy, so do I serve the Father and my
    God, believing all things which are written in the law and the
    prophets:</span></li>

    <li><span>Having hope in God, which these also themselves look
    for, that there shall be a resurrection of the just and
    unjust.</span></li>

    <li><span>And herein do I endeavour to have always a conscience
    without offence toward God, and towards men.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now after many years, I came to bring alms to my
    nation, and offerings, and vows.</span></li>

    <li><span>In which I was found purified in the temple: neither
    with multitude, nor with tumult.</span></li>

    <li><span>But certain Jews of Asia, who ought to be present
    before thee, and to accuse, if they had any thing against
    me:</span></li>

    <li><span>Or let these men themselves say, if they found in me
    any iniquity, when standing before the council,</span></li>

    <li><span>Except it be for this one voice only that I cried,
    standing among them, Concerning the resurrection of the dead am
    I judged this day by you.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Felix put them off, having most certain knowledge
    of this way, saying: When Lysias the tribune shall come down, I
    will hear you.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he commanded a centurion to keep him, and that he
    should be easy, and that he should not prohibit any of his
    friends to minister unto him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And after some days, Felix, coming with Drusilla his
    wife, who was a Jew, sent for Paul, and heard of him the faith,
    that is in Christ Jesus.</span></li>

    <li><span>And as he treated of justice, and chastity, and of
    the judgment to come, Felix being terrified, answered: For this
    time, go thy way: but when I have a convenient time, I will
    send for thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>Hoping also withal, that money should be given him by
    Paul; for which cause also oftentimes sending for him, he spoke
    with him.</span></li>

    <li><span>But when two years were ended, Felix had for
    successor Portius Festus. And Felix being willing to shew the
    Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="25">Acts 25</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Now when Festus was come into the province, after
    three days, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the chief priests, and principal men of the Jews,
    went unto him against Paul: and they besought him,</span></li>

    <li><span>Requesting favour against him, that he would command
    him to be brought to Jerusalem, laying wait to kill him in the
    way.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Festus answered: That Paul was kept in Caesarea,
    and that he himself would very shortly depart
    thither.</span></li>

    <li><span>Let them, therefore, saith he, among you that are
    able, go down with me, and accuse him, if there be any crime in
    the man.</span></li>

    <li><span>And having tarried among them no more than eight or
    ten days, he went down to Caesarea, and the next day he sat in
    the judgment seat; and commanded Paul to be
    brought.</span></li>

    <li><span>Who being brought, the Jews stood about him, who were
    come down from Jerusalem, objecting many and grievous causes,
    which they could not prove;</span></li>

    <li><span>Paul making answer for himself: Neither against the
    law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar,
    have I offended in any thing.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Festus, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure,
    answering Paul, said: Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there
    be judged of these things before me?</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Paul said: I stand at Caesar's judgment seat,
    where I ought to be judged. To the Jews I have done no injury,
    as thou very well knowest.</span></li>

    <li><span>For if I have injured them, or have committed any
    thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die. But if there be
    none of these things whereof they accuse me, no man may deliver
    me to them: I appeal to Caesar.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Festus having conferred with the council,
    answered: Hast thou appealed to Caesar? To Caesar shalt thou
    go.</span></li>

    <li><span>And after some days, king Agrippa and Bernice came
    down to Caesarea to salute Festus.</span></li>

    <li><span>And as they tarried there many days, Festus told the
    king of Paul, saying: A certain man was left prisoner by
    Felix.</span></li>

    <li><span>About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief
    priests, and the ancients of the Jews, came unto me, desiring
    condemnation against him.</span></li>

    <li><span>To whom I answered: It is not the custom of the
    Romans to condemn any man, before that he who is accused have
    his accusers present, and have liberty to make his answer, to
    clear himself of the things laid to his charge.</span></li>

    <li><span>When therefore they were come hither, without any
    delay, on the day following, sitting in the judgment seat, I
    commanded the man to be brought.</span></li>

    <li><span>Against whom, when the accusers stood up, they
    brought no accusation of things which I thought ill
    of:</span></li>

    <li><span>But had certain questions of their own superstition
    against him, and of one Jesus deceased, whom Paul affirmed to
    be alive.</span></li>

    <li><span>I therefore being in a doubt of this manner of
    question, asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there
    be judged of these things.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Paul appealing to be reserved unto the hearing of
    Augustus, I commanded him to be kept, till I might send him to
    Caesar.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Agrippa said to Festus: I would also hear the
    man, myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice were
    come with great pomp, and had entered into the hall of
    audience, with the tribunes, and principal men of the city, at
    Festus' commandment, Paul was brought forth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Festus saith: King Agrippa, and all ye men who
    are here present with us, you see this man, about whom all the
    multitude of the Jews dealt with me at Jerusalem, requesting
    and crying out that he ought not to live any
    longer.</span></li>

    <li><span>Yet have I found nothing that he hath committed
    worthy of death. But forasmuch as he himself hath appealed to
    Augustus, I have determined to send him.</span></li>

    <li><span>Of whom I have nothing certain to write to my lord.
    For which cause I have brought him forth before you, and
    especially before thee, O king Agrippa, that examination being
    made, I may have what to write.</span></li>

    <li><span>For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner,
    and not to signify the things laid to his charge.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="26">Acts 26</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Then Agrippa said to Paul: Thou art permitted to
    speak for thyself. Then Paul stretching forth his hand, began
    to make his answer.</span></li>

    <li><span>I think myself happy, O king Agrippa, that I am to
    answer for myself this day before thee, touching all the things
    whereof I am accused by the Jews.</span></li>

    <li><span>Especially as thou knowest all, both customs and
    questions that are among the Jews: Wherefore I beseech thee to
    hear me patiently.</span></li>

    <li><span>And my life indeed from my youth, which was from the
    beginning among my own nation in Jerusalem, all the Jews do
    know:</span></li>

    <li><span>Having known me from the beginning (if they will give
    testimony) that according to the most sure sect of our religion
    I lived a Pharisee.</span></li>

    <li><span>And now for the hope of the promise that was made by
    God to the fathers, do I stand subject to judgment:</span></li>

    <li><span>Unto which, our twelve tribes, serving night and day,
    hope to come. For which hope, O king, I am accused by the
    Jews.</span></li>

    <li><span>Why should it be thought a thing incredible, that God
    should raise the dead?</span></li>

    <li><span>And I indeed did formerly think, that I ought to do
    many things contrary to the name of Jesus of
    Nazareth.</span></li>

    <li><span>Which also I did at Jerusalem, and many of the saints
    did I shut up in prison, having received authority of the chief
    priests: and when they were put to death, I brought the
    sentence.</span></li>

    <li><span>And oftentimes punishing them, in every synagogue, I
    compelled them to blaspheme: and being yet more mad against
    them, I persecuted them even unto foreign cities.</span></li>

    <li><span>Whereupon when I was going to Damascus with authority
    and permission of the chief priest,</span></li>

    <li><span>At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from
    heaven above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me,
    and them that were in company with me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when we were all fallen down on the ground, I
    heard a voice speaking to me in the Hebrew tongue: Saul, Saul,
    why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against
    the goad.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I said: Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord
    answered: I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.</span></li>

    <li><span>But rise up, and stand upon thy feet: for to this end
    have I appeared to thee, that I may make thee a minister, and a
    witness of those things which thou hast seen, and of those
    things wherein I will appear to thee,</span></li>

    <li><span>Delivering thee from the people, and from the
    nations, unto which now I send thee:</span></li>

    <li><span>To open their eyes, that they may be converted from
    darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that
    they may receive forgiveness of sins, and a lot among the
    saints, by the faith that is in me.</span></li>

    <li><span>Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not incredulous to
    the heavenly vision:</span></li>

    <li><span>But to them first that are at Damascus, and at
    Jerusalem, and unto all the country of Judea, and to the
    Gentiles did I preach, that they should do penance, and turn to
    God, doing works worthy of penance.</span></li>

    <li><span>For this cause the Jews, when I was in the temple,
    having apprehended me, went about to kill me.</span></li>

    <li><span>But being aided by the help of God, I stand unto this
    day, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other thing
    than those which the prophets, and Moses did say should come to
    pass:</span></li>

    <li><span>That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the
    first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light to
    the people, and to the Gentiles.</span></li>

    <li><span>As he spoke these things, and made his answer, Festus
    said with a loud voice: Paul, thou art beside thyself: much
    learning doth make thee mad.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Paul said: I am not mad, most excellent Festus,
    but I speak words of truth and soberness.</span></li>

    <li><span>For the king knoweth of these things, to whom also I
    speak with confidence. For I am persuaded that none of these
    things are hidden from him. For neither was any of these things
    done in a corner.</span></li>

    <li><span>Believest thou the prophets, O king Agrippa? I know
    that thou believest.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Agrippa said to Paul: In a little thou persuadest
    me to become a Christian.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Paul said: I would to God, that both in a little
    and in much, not only thou, but also all that hear me, this
    day, should become such as I also am, except these
    bands.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice,
    and they that sat with them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they were gone aside, they spoke among
    themselves, saying: This man hath done nothing worthy of death
    or of bands.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Agrippa said to Festus: This man might have been
    set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Caesar.</span></li>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And when it was determined that he should sail into
    Italy, and that Paul, with the other prisoners, should be
    delivered to a centurion, named Julius, of the band
    Augusta,</span></li>

    <li><span>Going on board a ship of Adrumetum, we launched,
    meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia, Aristarchus, the
    Macedonian of Thessalonica, continuing with us.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the day following we came to Sidon. And Julius
    treating Paul courteously, permitted him to go to his friends,
    and to take care of himself.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under
    Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</span></li>

    <li><span>And sailing over the sea of Cilicia, and Pamphylia,
    we came to Lystra, which is in Lycia:</span></li>

    <li><span>And there the centurion finding a ship of Alexandria
    sailing into Italy, removed us into it.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when for many days we had sailed slowly, and were
    scarce come over against Gnidus, the wind not suffering us, we
    sailed near Crete by Salmone:</span></li>

    <li><span>And with much ado sailing by it, we came into a
    certain place, which is called Good-havens, nigh to which was
    the city of Thalassa.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when much time was spent, and when sailing now
    was dangerous, because the fast was now past, Paul comforted
    them,</span></li>

    <li><span>Saying to them: Ye men, I see that the voyage
    beginneth to be with injury and much damage, not only of the
    lading and ship, but also of our lives.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the centurion believed the pilot and the master
    of the ship, more than those things which were said by
    Paul.</span></li>

    <li><span>And whereas it was not a commodious haven to winter
    in, the greatest part gave counsel to sail thence, if by any
    means they might reach Phenice to winter there, which is a
    haven of Crete, looking towards the southwest and
    northwest.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the south wind gently blowing, thinking that they
    had obtained their purpose, when they had loosed from Asson,
    they sailed close by Crete.</span></li>

    <li><span>But not long after, there arose against it a
    tempestuous wind, called Euroaquilo.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up
    against the wind, giving up the ship to the winds, we were
    driven.</span></li>

    <li><span>And running under a certain island, that is called
    Cauda, we had much work to come by the boat.</span></li>

    <li><span>Which being taken up, they used helps, undergirding
    the ship, and fearing lest they should fall into the
    quicksands, they let down the sail yard, and so were
    driven.</span></li>

    <li><span>And we being mightily tossed with the tempest, the
    next day they lightened the ship.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the third day they cast out with their own hands
    the tackling of the ship.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when neither sun nor stars appeared for many
    days, and no small storm lay on us, all hope of our being saved
    was now taken away.</span></li>

    <li><span>And after they had fasted a long time, Paul standing
    forth in the midst of them, said: You should indeed, O ye men,
    have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and
    have gained this harm and loss.</span></li>

    <li><span>And now I exhort you to be of good cheer. For there
    shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but only of the
    ship.</span></li>

    <li><span>For an angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,
    stood by me this night,</span></li>

    <li><span>Saying: Fear not, Paul, thou must be brought before
    Caesar; and behold, God hath given thee all them that sail with
    thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer; for I believe God
    that it shall so be, as it hath been told me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And we must come unto a certain island.</span></li>

    <li><span>But after the fourteenth night was come, as we were
    sailing in Adria, about midnight, the shipmen deemed that they
    discovered some country.</span></li>

    <li><span>Who also sounding, found twenty fathoms; and going on
    a little further, they found fifteen fathoms.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then fearing lest we should fall upon rough places,
    they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the
    day.</span></li>

    <li><span>But as the shipmen sought to fly out of the ship,
    having let down the boat into the sea, under colour, as though
    they would have cast anchors out of the forepart of the
    ship,</span></li>

    <li><span>Paul said to the centurion, and to the soldiers:
    Except these stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and
    let her fall off.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when it began to be light, Paul besought them all
    to take meat, saying: This day is the fourteenth day that you
    have waited, and continued fasting, taking nothing.</span></li>

    <li><span>Wherefore I pray you to take some meat for your
    health's sake; for there shall not an hair of the head of any
    of you perish.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had said these things, taking bread, he
    gave thanks to God in the sight of them all; and when he had
    broken it, he began to eat.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then were they all of better cheer, and they also
    took some meat.</span></li>

    <li><span>And we were in all in the ship, two hundred
    threescore and sixteen souls.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the
    ship, casting the wheat into the sea.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when it was day, they knew not the land; but they
    discovered a certain creek that had a shore, into which they
    minded, if they could, to thrust in the ship.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they had taken up the anchors, they
    committed themselves to the sea, loosing withal the rudder
    bands; and hoisting up the mainsail to the wind, they made
    towards shore.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when we were fallen into a place where two seas
    met, they run the ship aground; and the forepart indeed,
    sticking fast, remained unmoveable: but the hinder part was
    broken with the violence of the sea.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the soldiers' counsel was, that they should kill
    the prisoners, lest any of them, swimming out, should
    escape.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the centurion, willing to save Paul, forbade it
    to be done; and he commanded that they who could swim, should
    cast themselves first into the sea, and save themselves, and
    get to land.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the rest, some they carried on boards, and some
    on those things that belonged to the ship. And so it came to
    pass, that every soul got safe to land.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="28">Acts 28</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And when we had escaped, then we knew that the island
    was called Melita. But the barbarians shewed us no small
    courtesy.</span></li>

    <li><span>For kindling a fire, they refreshed us all, because
    of the present rain, and of the cold.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Paul had gathered together a bundle of
    sticks, and had laid them on the fire, a viper coming out of
    the heat, fastened on his hand.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the barbarians saw the beast hanging on his
    hand, they said one to another: Undoubtedly this man is a
    murderer, who though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance
    doth not suffer him to live.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he indeed shaking off the beast into the fire,
    suffered no harm.</span></li>

    <li><span>But they supposed that he would begin to swell up,
    and that he would suddenly fall down and die. But expecting
    long, and seeing that there came no harm to him, changing their
    minds, they said, that he was a god.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now in these places were possessions of the chief man
    of the island, named Publius, who receiving us, for three days
    entertained us courteously.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it happened that the father of Publius lay sick
    of a fever, and of a bloody flux. To whom Paul entered in; and
    when he had prayed, and laid his hands on him, he healed
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>Which being done, all that had diseases in the
    island, came and were healed:</span></li>

    <li><span>Who also honoured us with many honours, and when we
    were to set sail, they laded us with such things as were
    necessary.</span></li>

    <li><span>And after three months, we sailed in a ship of
    Alexandria, that had wintered in the island, whose sign was the
    Castors.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when we were come to Syracusa, we tarried there
    three days.</span></li>

    <li><span>From thence, compassing by the shore, we came to
    Rhegium: and after one day, the south wind blowing, we came the
    second day to Puteoli;</span></li>

    <li><span>Where, finding brethren, we were desired to tarry
    with them seven days: and so we went to Rome.</span></li>

    <li><span>And from thence, when the brethren had heard of us,
    they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum, and the Three
    Taverns: whom when Paul saw, he gave thanks to God, and took
    courage.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when we were come to Rome, Paul was suffered to
    dwell by himself, with a soldier that kept him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And after the third day, he called together the chief
    of the Jews. And when they were assembled, he said to them:
    Men, brethren, I, having done nothing against the people, or
    the custom of our fathers, was delivered prisoner from
    Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans;</span></li>

    <li><span>Who, when they had examined me, would have released
    me, for that there was no cause of death in me;</span></li>

    <li><span>But the Jews contradicting it, I was constrained to
    appeal unto Caesar; not that I had any thing to accuse my
    nation of.</span></li>

    <li><span>For this cause therefore I desired to see you, and to
    speak to you. Because that for the hope of Israel, I am bound
    with this chain.</span></li>

    <li><span>But they said to him: We neither received letters
    concerning thee from Judea, neither did any of the brethren
    that came hither, relate or speak any evil of thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest; for
    as concerning this sect, we know that it is every where
    contradicted.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they had appointed him a day, there came
    very many to him unto his lodgings; to whom he expounded,
    testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning
    Jesus, out of the law of Moses and the prophets, from morning
    until evening.</span></li>

    <li><span>And some believed the things that were said; but some
    believed not.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they agreed not among themselves, they
    departed, Paul speaking this one word: Well did the Holy Ghost
    speak to our fathers by Isaias the prophet,</span></li>

    <li><span>Saying: Go to this people, and say to them: With the
    ear you shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you
    shall see, and shall not perceive.</span></li>

    <li><span>For the heart of this people is grown gross, and with
    their ears have they heard heavily, and their eyes they have
    shut; lest perhaps they should see with their eyes, and hear
    with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be
    converted, and I should heal them.</span></li>

    <li><span>Be it known therefore to you, that this salvation of
    God is sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear it.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had said these things, the Jews went out
    from him, having much reasoning among themselves.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he remained two whole years in his own hired
    lodging; and he received all that came in to him,</span></li>

    <li><span>Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things
    which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence,
    without prohibition.</span></li>
