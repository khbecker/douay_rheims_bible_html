<ol>
<li><span>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ,
according to the faith of the elect of God and the acknowledging of
the truth, which is according to godliness:</span></li>
<li><span>Unto the hope of life everlasting, which God, who lieth
not, hath promised before the times of the world:</span></li>
<li><span>But hath in due times manifested his word in preaching,
which is committed to me according to the commandment of God our
Savior:</span></li>
<li><span>To Titus my beloved son, according to the common faith,
grace and peace from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus our
Savior.</span></li>
<li><span>For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou shouldest
set in order the things that are wanting, and shouldest ordain
priests in every city, as I also appointed thee:</span></li>
<li><span>If any be without crime, the husband of one wife, having
faithful children, not accused of riot, or unruly.</span></li>
<li><span>For a bishop must be without crime, as the steward of
God: not proud, not subject to anger, not given to wine, no
striker, not greedy of filthy lucre:</span></li>
<li><span>But given to hospitality, gentle, sober, just, holy,
continent:</span></li>
<li><span>Embracing that faithful word which is according to
doctrine, that he may be able to exhort in sound doctrine, and to
convince the gainsayers.</span></li>
<li><span>For there are also many disobedient, vain talkers, and
seducers: especially they who are of the circumcision:</span></li>
<li><span>Who must be reproved, who subvert whole houses, teaching
things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.</span></li>
<li><span>One of them a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians
are always liars, evil beasts, slothful bellies.</span></li>
<li><span>This testimony is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply,
that they may be sound in the faith;</span></li>
<li><span>Not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men,
who turn themselves away from the truth.</span></li>
<li><span>All things are clean to the clean: but to them that are
defiled, and to unbelievers, nothing is clean: but both their mind
and their conscience are defiled.</span></li>
<li><span>They profess that they know God: but in their works they
deny him; being abominable, and incredulous, and to every good work
reprobate.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="2">Titus 2</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>But speak thou the things that become sound
doctrine:</span></li>
<li><span>That the aged men be sober, chaste, prudent, sound in
faith, in love, in patience.</span></li>
<li><span>The aged women, in like manner, in holy attire, not false
accusers, not given to much wine, teaching well:</span></li>
<li><span>That they may teach the young women to be wise, to love
their husbands, to love their children,</span></li>
<li><span>To be discreet, chaste, sober, having a care of the
house, gentle, obedient to their husbands, that the word of God be
not blasphemed.</span></li>
<li><span>Young men, in like manner, exhort that they be
sober.</span></li>
<li><span>In all things shew thyself an example of good works, in
doctrine, in integrity, in gravity,</span></li>
<li><span>The sound word that can not be blamed: that he, who is on
the contrary part, may be afraid, having no evil to say of
us.</span></li>
<li><span>Exhort servants to be obedient to their masters, in all
things pleasing, not gainsaying:</span></li>
<li><span>Not defrauding, but in all things shewing good fidelity,
that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all
things:</span></li>
<li><span>For the grace of God our Savior hath appeared to all
men;</span></li>
<li><span>Instructing us, that, denying ungodliness and worldly
desires, we should live soberly, and justly, and godly in this
world,</span></li>
<li><span>Looking for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of
the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ,</span></li>
<li><span>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all
iniquity, and might cleanse to himself a people acceptable, a
pursuer of good works.</span></li>
<li><span>These things speak, and exhort and rebuke with all
authority. Let no man despise thee.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="3">Titus 3</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Admonish them to be subject to princes and powers, to
obey at a word, to be ready to every good work.</span></li>
<li><span>To speak evil of no man, not to be litigious, but gentle:
shewing all mildness towards all men.</span></li>
<li><span>For we ourselves also were some time unwise, incredulous,
erring, slaves to divers desires and pleasures, living in malice
and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</span></li>
<li><span>But when the goodness and kindness of God our Savior
appeared:</span></li>
<li><span>Not by the works of justice, which we have done, but
according to his mercy, he saved us, by the laver of regeneration,
and renovation of the Holy Ghost;</span></li>
<li><span>Whom he hath poured forth upon us abundantly, through
Jesus Christ our Savior:</span></li>
<li><span>That, being justified by his grace, we may be heirs,
according to hope of life everlasting.</span></li>
<li><span>It is a faithful saying: and these things I will have
thee affirm constantly: that they, who believe in God, may be
careful to excel in good works. These things are good and
profitable unto men.</span></li>
<li><span>But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and
contentions, and strivings about the law. For they are unprofitable
and vain.</span></li>
<li><span>A man that is a heretic, after the first and second
admonition, avoid:</span></li>
<li><span>Knowing that he, that is such an one, is subverted, and
sinneth, being condemned by his own judgment.</span></li>
<li><span>When I shall send to thee Artemas or Tychicus, make haste
to come unto me to Nicopolis. For there I have determined to
winter.</span></li>
<li><span>Send forward Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollo, with care,
that nothing be wanting to them.</span></li>
<li><span>And let our men also learn to excel in good works for
necessary uses: that they be not unfruitful.</span></li>
<li><span>All that are with me salute thee: salute them that love
us in the faith. The grace of God be with you all.
Amen.</span></li>
