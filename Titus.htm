Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;<li>Not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men, who turn themselves away from the truth.<li>All things are clean to the clean: but to them that are defiled, and to unbelievers, nothing is clean: but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.<li>They profess that they know God: but in their works they deny him; being abominable, and incredulous, and to every good work reprobate.</ol><h2><a name=2>Titus 2</a></h2><ol><li>But speak thou the things that become sound doctrine:<li>That the aged men be sober, chaste, prudent, sound in faith, in love, in patience.<li>The aged women, in like manner, in holy attire, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teaching well:<li>That they may teach the young women to be wise, to love their husbands, to love their children,<li>To be discreet, chaste, sober, having a care of the house, gentle, obedient to their husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.<li>Young men, in like manner, exhort that they be sober.<li>In all things shew thyself an example of good works, in doctrine, in integrity, in gravity,<li>The sound word that can not be blamed: that he, who is on the contrary part, may be afraid, having no evil to say of us.<li>Exhort servants to be obedient to their masters, in all things pleasing, not gainsaying:<li>Not defrauding, but in all things shewing good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things:<li>For the grace of God our Savior hath appeared to all men;<li>Instructing us, that, denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we should live soberly, and justly, and godly in this world,<li>Looking for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ,<li>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and might cleanse to himself a people acceptable, a pursuer of good works.<li>These things speak, and exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</ol><h2><a name=3>Titus 3</a></h2><ol><li>Admonish them to be subject to princes and powers, to obey at a word, to be ready to every good work.<li>To speak evil of no man, not to be litigious, but gentle: shewing all mildness towards all men.<li>For we ourselves also were some time unwise, incredulous, erring, slaves to divers desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.<li>But when the goodness and kindness of God our Savior appeared:<li>Not by the works of justice, which we have done, but according to his mercy, he saved us, by the laver of regeneration, and renovation of the Holy Ghost;<li>Whom he hath poured forth upon us abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Savior:<li>That, being justified by his grace, we may be heirs, according to hope of life everlasting.<li>It is a faithful saying: and these things I will have thee affirm constantly: that they, who believe in God, may be careful to excel in good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.<li>But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law. For they are unprofitable and vain.<li>A man that is a heretic, after the first and second admonition, avoid:<li>Knowing that he, that is such an one, is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned by his own judgment.<li>When I shall send to thee Artemas or Tychicus, make haste to come unto me to Nicopolis. For there I have determined to winter.<li>Send forward Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollo, with care, that nothing be wanting to them.<li>And let our men also learn to excel in good works for necessary uses: that they be not unfruitful.<li>All that are with me salute thee: salute them that love us in the faith. The grace of God be with you all. Amen.</ol></body></html>
