<ol>
<li><span>The vision of Abdias. Thus saith the Lord God to Edom: We
have heard a rumour from the Lord, and he hath sent an ambassador
to the nations: Arise, and let us rise up to battle against
him.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I have made thee small among the nations: thou art
exceeding contemptible.</span></li>
<li><span>The pride of thy heart hath lifted thee up, who dwellest
in the clefts of the rocks, and settest up thy throne on high: who
sayest in thy heart: Who shall bring me down to the ground
?</span></li>
<li><span>Though thou be exalted as an eagle, and though thou set
thy nest among the stars: thence will I bring thee down, saith the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>If thieves had gone in to thee, if robbers by night, how
wouldst thou have held thy peace? would they not have stolen till
they had enough ? if the grapegatherers had come in to thee, would
they not have left thee at the least a cluster?</span></li>
<li><span>How have they searched Esau, how have they sought out his
hidden things?</span></li>
<li><span>They have sent thee out even to the border: all the men
of thy confederacy have deceived thee: the men of thy peace have
prevailed against thee: they that eat with thee shall lay snares
under thee: there is no wisdom in him.</span></li>
<li><span>Shall not I in that day, saith the Lord, destroy the wise
out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau
?</span></li>
<li><span>And thy valiant men of the south shall be afraid, that
man may be cut off from the mount of Esau.</span></li>
<li><span>For the slaughter, and for the iniquity against thy
brother Jacob, confusion shall cover thee, and thou shalt perish
for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>In the day when thou stoodest against him, when strangers
carried away his army captive, and foreigners entered into his
gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem: thou also wast as one of
them.</span></li>
<li><span>But thou shalt not look on in the day of thy brother, in
the day of his leaving his country: and thou shalt not rejoice over
the children of Juda, in the day of their destruction: and thou
shalt not magnify thy mouth in the day of distress.</span></li>
<li><span>Neither shalt thou enter into the gate of my people in
the day of their ruin: neither shalt thou also look on in his evils
in the day of his calamity: and thou shalt not be sent out against
his army in the day of his desolation.</span></li>
<li><span>Neither shalt thou stand in the crossways to kill them
that flee: and thou shalt not shut up them that remain of him in
the day of tribulation.</span></li>
<li><span>For the day of the Lord is at hand upon all nations: as
thou hast done, so shall it be done to thee: he will turn thy
reward upon thy own head.</span></li>
<li><span>For as you have drunk upon my holy mountain, so all
nations shall drink continually: and they shall drink, and sup up,
and they shall be as though they were not.</span></li>
<li><span>And in mount Sion shall be salvation, and it shall be
holy, and the house of Jacob shall possess those that possessed
them.</span></li>
<li><span>And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of
Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau stubble: and they shall be
kindled in them, and shall devour them: and there shall be no
remains of the house of Esau, for the Lord hath spoken
it.</span></li>
<li><span>And they that are toward the south, shall inherit the
mount of Esau, and they that are in the plains, the Philistines:
and they shall possess the country of Ephraim, and the country of
Samaria: and Benjamin shall possess Galaad.</span></li>
<li><span>And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel,
all the places of the Chanaanites even to Sarepta: and the
captivity of Jerusalem that is in Bospho- rus, shall possess the
cities of the south.</span></li>
<li><span>And saviours shall come up into mount Sion to judge the
mount of Esau: and the kingdom shall be for the Lord.</span></li>
