They turned not when they went: but every one went straight forward.<li>And as for the likeness of their faces: there was the face of a man, and the face of a lion on the right side of all the four: and the face of an ox, on the left side of all the four: and the face of an eagle over all the four.<li>And their faces, and their wings were stretched upward: two wings of every one were joined, and two covered their bodies:<li>And every one of them went straight forward: whither the impulse of the spirit was to go, thither they went: and they turned not when they went.<li>And as for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like that of burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps. This was the vision running to and fro in the midst of the living creatures, a bright fire, and lightning going forth from the fire.<li>And the living creatures ran and returned like flashes of lightning.<li>Now as I beheld the living creatures, there appeared upon the earth by the living creatures one wheel with four faces.<li>And the appearance of the wheels, and the work of them was like the appearance of the sea: and the four had all one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the midst of a wheel.<li>When they went, they went by their four parts: and they turned not when they went.<li>The wheels had also a size, and a height, and a dreadful appearance: and the whole body was full of eyes round about all the four.<li>And when the living creatures went, the wheels also went together by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels also were lifted up with them.<li>Whithersoever the spirit went, thither as the spirit went the wheels also were lifted up withal, and followed it: for the spirit of life was in the wheels.<li>When those went these went, and when those stood these stood, and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels also were lifted up together, and followed them: for the spirit of life was in the wheels.<li>And over the heads of the living creatures was the likeness of the firmament, as the appearance of crystal terrible to behold, and stretched out over their heads above.<li>And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other, every one with two wings covered his body, and the other was covered in like manner.<li>And I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of many waters, as it were the voice of the most high God: when they walked, it was like the voice of a multitude, like the noise of an army, and when they stood, their wings were let down.<li>For when a voice came from above the firmament, that was over their heads, they stood, and let down their wings.<li>And above the firmament that was over their heads, was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of the sapphire stone, and upon the likeness of the throne, was a likeness as of the appearance of a man above upon it.<li>And I saw as it were the resemblance of amber as the appearance of fire within it round about: from his loins and upward, and from his loins downward, I saw as it were the resemblance of fire shining round about.<li>As the appearance of the rainbow when it is in a cloud on a rainy day: this was the appearance of the brightness round about.</ol><h2><a name=2>Ezechiel 2</a></h2><ol><li>This was the vision of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And I saw, and I fell upon my face, and I heard the voice of one that spoke. And he said to me: Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak to thee.<li>And the spirit entered into me after that he spoke to me, and he set me upon my feet: and I heard him speaking to me,<li>And saying: Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious people, that hath revolted from me, they, and their fathers, have transgressed my covenant even unto this day.<li>And they to whom I send thee are children of a hard face, and of an obstinate heart: and thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord God:<li>If so be they at least will hear, and if so be they will forbear, for they are a provoking house: and they shall know that there hath been a prophet in the midst of them.<li>And thou, O son of man, fear not, neither be thou afraid of their words: for thou art among unbelievers and destroyers, and thou dwellest with scorpions. Fear not their words, neither be thou dismayed at their looks: for they are a provoking house.<li>And thou shalt speak my words to them, if perhaps they will hear, and forbear: for they provoke me to anger.<li>But thou, O son of man, hear all that I say to thee: and do not thou provoke me, as that house provoketh me: open thy mouth, and eat what I give thee.<li>And I looked, and behold, a hand was sent to me, wherein was a book rolled up: and he spread it before me, and it was written within and without: and there were written in it lamentations, and canticles, and woe.</ol><h2><a name=3>Ezechiel 3</a></h2><ol><li>And he said to me: Son of man, eat all that thou shalt find: eat this book, and go speak to the children of Israel.<li>And I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that book :<li>And he said to me: Son of man, thy belly shall eat, and thy bowels shall be filled with this book, which I give thee. And I did eat it: and it was sweet as honey in my mouth.<li>And he said to me: Son of man, go to the house of Israel, and thou shalt speak my words to them.<li>For thou art not sent to a people of a profound speech, and of an unknown tongue, but to the house of Israel:<li>Nor to many nations of a strange speech, and of an unknown tongue, whose words thou canst not understand: and if thou wert sent to them, they would hearken to thee.<li>But the house of Israel will not hearken to thee: because they will not hearken to me: for all the house of Israel are of a hard forehead and an obstinate heart.<li>Behold I have made thy face stronger than their faces: and thy forehead harder than their foreheads.<li>I have made thy face like an adamant and like flint: fear them not, neither be thou dismayed at their presence: for they are a provoking house.<li>And he said to me: Son of man, receive in thy heart, and hear with thy ears, all the words that I speak to thee:<li>And go get thee in to them of the captivity, to the children of thy people, and thou shalt speak to them, and shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord: If so be they will hear and will forbear.<li>And the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great commotion, saying: Blessed be the glory of the Lord, from his place.<li>And the noise of the wings of the living creatures striking one against another, and the noise of the wheels following the living creatures, and the noise of a great commotion.<li>The spirit also lifted me, and took me up: and I went away in bitterness in the indignation of my spirit: for the hand of the Lord was with me, strengthening me.<li>And I came to them of the captivity, to the heap of new corn, to them that dwelt by the river Chobar, and I sat where they sat: and I remained there seven days mourning in the midst of them.<li>And at the end of seven days the word of the Lord came to me, saying:<li>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel: and thou shalt hear the word out of my mouth, and shalt tell it them from me.<li>If, when I say to the wicked, Thou shalt surely die: thou declare it not to him, nor speak to him, that he may be converted from his wicked way, and live: the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at thy hand.<li>But if thou give warning to the wicked, and he be not converted from his wickedness, and from his evil way: he indeed shall die in his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul.<li>Moreover if the just man shall turn away from his justice, and shall commit iniquity: I will lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die, because thou hast not given him warning: he shall die in his sin, and his justices which he hath done, shall not be remembered: but I will require his blood at thy hand.<li>But if thou warn the just man, that the just may not sin, and he doth not sin: living he shall live, because thou hast warned him, and thou hast delivered thy soul.<li>And the hand of the Lord was upon me, and he said to me: Rise and go forth into the plain, and there I will speak to thee.<li>And I rose up, and went forth into the plain: and behold the glory of the Lord stood there, like the glory which I saw by the river Chobar: and I fell upon my face.<li>And the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet: and he spoke to me, and said to me: Go in; and shut thyself up in the midst of thy house.<li>And thou, O son of man, behold they shall put bands upon thee, and they shall bind thee with them: and thou shalt not go forth from the midst of them.<li>And I will make thy tongue stick fast to the roof of thy mouth, and thou shalt be dumb, and not as a man that reproveth: because they are a provoking house.<li>But when I shall speak to thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: He that heareth, let him hear: and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a provoking house.</ol><h2><a name=4>Ezechiel 4</a></h2><ol><li>And thou, O son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee: and draw upon it the plan of the city of Jerusalem.<li>And lay siege against it, and build forts, and cast up a mount, and set a camp against it, and place battering rams round about it.<li>And take unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face resolutely against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it: it is a sign to the house of Israel.<li>And thou shalt sleep upon thy left side, and shalt lay the iniquities of the house of Israel upon it, according to the number of the days that thou shalt sleep upon it, and thou shalt take upon thee their iniquity.<li>And I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days three hundred and ninety days: and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.<li>And when thou hast accomplished this, thou shalt sleep again upon thy right side, and thou shalt take upon thee the iniquity of the house of Juda forty days: a day for it year, yea, a day for a year I have appointed to thee.<li>And thou shalt turn thy face to the siege of Jerusalem, and thy arm shall be stretched out: and thou shalt prophesy against it.<li>Behold I have encompassed thee with bands: and thou shalt not turn thyself from one side to the other, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege.<li>And take to thee wheat and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side: three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.<li>And thy meat that thou shalt eat, shall be in weight twenty staters a day: from time to time thou shalt eat it.<li>And thou shalt drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from time to time thou shalt drink it,<li>And thou shalt eat it as barley bread baked under the ashes: and thou shalt cover it, in their sight, with the dung that cometh out of a man.<li>And the Lord said: So shall the children of Israel Beat their bread all filthy among the nations whither I will cast them out.<li>And I said: Ah, ah, ah, O Lord God, behold my soul hath not been defiled, and from my infancy even till now, I have not eaten any thing that died of itself, or was torn by beasts, and no unclean flesh hath entered into my mouth.<li>And he said to me: Behold I have given thee neat's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt make thy bread therewith.<li>And he said to me: Son of man: Behold, I will break in pieces the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care: and they shall drink water by measure, and in distress.<li>So that when bread and water fail, every man may fall against his brother, and they may pine away in their iniquities.</ol><h2><a name=5>Ezechiel 5</a></h2><ol><li>And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife that shaveth the hair: and cause it to pass over thy head, and over thy beard: and take thee a balance to weigh in, and divide the hair.<li>A third part thou shalt burn with fire in the midst of the city, according to the fulfilling of the days of the siege: and thou shalt take a third part, and cut it in pieces with the knife all round about: and the other third part thou shalt scatter in the wind, and I will draw out the sword after them.<li>And thou shalt take thereof a small number: and shalt bind them in the skirt of thy cloak.<li>And thou shalt take of them again, and shalt cast them in the midst of the fire, and shalt burn them with fire: and out of it shall come forth a fire into all the house of Israel.<li>Thus saith the Lord God: This is Jerusalem, I have set her in the midst of the nations, and the countries round about her.<li>And she hath despised my judgments, so as to be more wicked than the Gentiles; and my commandments, more than the countries that are round about her: for they have cast off my judgments, and have not walked in my commandments.<li>Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Because you have surpassed the Gentiles that are round about you, and have not walked in my commandments, and have not kept my judgments, and have not done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you:<li>Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Behold I come against thee, and I myself will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the Gentiles.<li>And I will do in thee that which I have not done: and the like to which I will do no more, because of all thy abominations.<li>Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers: and I will execute judgments in thee, and I will scatter thy whole remnant into every wind.<li>Therefore as I live, saith the Lord God : Because thou hast violated my sanctuary with all thy offences, and with ail thy abominations: I will also break thee in pieces, and my eye shall not spare, and I will not have any pity.<li>A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and shall be consumed with famine in the midst of thee: and a third part of thee shall fall by the sword round about thee: and a third part of thee will I scatter into every wind, and I will draw out a sword after them.<li>And I will accomplish my fury, and will cause my indignation to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the Lord have spoken it in my zeal, when I shall have accomplished my indignation in them.<li>And I will make thee desolate, and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of every one that passeth by.<li>And thou shalt be a reproach, and a scoff, an example, and an astonishment amongst the nations that are round about thee, when I shall have executed judgments in thee in anger, and in indignation, and in wrathful rebukes.<li>I the Lord have spoken it: When I shall send upon them the grievous arrows of famine, which shall bring death, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will gather together famine against you: and I will break among you the staff of bread.<li>And I will send in upon you famine, and evil beasts unto utter destruction: and pestilence, and blood shall pass through thee, and I will bring in the sword upon thee. I the Lord have spoken it.</ol><h2><a name=6>Ezechiel 6</a></h2><ol><li>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:<li>Son of man, set thy face towards the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them.<li>And say: Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God: Thus Faith the Lord God to the mountains, and to the hills, and to the rocks, and the valleys: Behold, I will bring upon you the sword, and I will destroy your high places.<li>And I will throw down your altars, and your idols shall be broken in pieces: and I will cast down your slain before your idols.<li>And I will lay the dead carcasses of the children of Israel before your idols: and I will scatter Sour bones round about your altars,<li>In all your dwelling places. The cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be thrown down, and destroyed, and your altars shall be abolished, and shall be broken in pieces: and your idols shall be no more, and your temples shall be destroyed, and your works shall be defaced.<li>And the slain shall fall in the midst of you: and you shall know that I am the Lord.<li>And I will leave in you some that shall escape the sword among the nations, when I shall have scattered you, through the countries.<li>And they that are saved of you shall remember me amongst the nations to which they are carried captives: because I have broken their heart that was faithless, and revolted from me: and their eyes that went a fornicating after their idols: and they shall be displeased with themselves because of the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.<li>And they shall know that I the Lord have not spoken in vain that I would do this evil to them.<li>Thus saith the Lord God: Strike with thy hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say: Alas, for all the abominations of the evils of the house of Israel: for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine and by the pestilence.<li>He that is far off shall die of the pestilence: and he that is near, shall fall by the sword: and he that remaineth, and is besieged, shall die by the famine: and I will accomplish my indignation upon them.<li>And you shall know that I am the Lord, when your slain shall be amongst your idols, round about your altars, in every high hill, and on all the tops of mountains, and under every woody tree, and under every thick oak, the place where they burnt sweet smelling frankincense to all their idols.<li>And I will stretch forth my hand upon them: and I will make the land desolate, and abandoned from the desert of Deblatha in all their dwelling places: and they shall know that I am the Lord.</ol><h2><a name=7>Ezechiel 7</a></h2><ol><li>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:<li>And thou son of man, thus saith the Lord God to the land of Israel: The end is come, the end is come upon the four quarters of the land.<li>Now is an end come upon thee, and I will send my wrath upon thee, and I will judge thee according to thy ways: and I will set all thy abominations against thee.<li>And my eye shall not spare thee, and I will shew thee no pity: but I will lay thy ways upon thee, and thy abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and you shall know that I am the Lord.<li>Thus saith the Lord God: One affliction, behold an affliction is come.<li>An end is come, the end is come, it hath awaked against thee: behold it is come.<li>Destruction is come upon thee that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of slaughter is near, and not of the joy of mountains.<li>Now very shortly I will pour out my wrath upon thee, and I will accomplish my anger in thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and I will lay upon thee all thy crimes.<li>And my eye shall not spare, neither will I shew mercy: but I will lay thy ways upon thee, and thy abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and you shall know that I am the Lord that strike.<li>Behold the day, behold it is come: destruction is gone forth, the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.<li>Iniquity is risen up into a rod of impiety: nothing of them shall remain, nor of their people, nor of the noise of them: and there shall be no rest among them.<li>The time is come, the day is at hand: let not the buyer rejoice: nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the people thereof.<li>For the seller shall not return to that which he hath sold, although their life be yet among the living. For the vision which regardeth all the multitude thereof, shall not go back: neither shall man be strengthened in the iniquity of his life.<li>Blow the trumpet, let all be made ready, yet there is none to go to the battle: for my wrath shall be upon all the people thereof.<li>The sword without: and the pestilence, and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die by the sword: and they that are in the city, shall be devoured by the pestilence, and the famine.<li>And such of them as shall flee shall escape: and they shall be in the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them trembling, every one for his iniquity.<li>All hands shall be made feeble, and all knees shall run with water.<li>And they shall gird themselves with haircloth, and fear shall cover them, and shame shall be upon every face, and baldness upon all their heads.<li>Their silver shall be cast forth, and their gold shall become a dunghill. Their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the Lord. They shall not satisfy their soul, and their bellies shall not be filled: because it hath been the stumblingblock of their iniquity.<li>And they have turned the ornament of their jewels into pride, and have made of it the images of their abominations, and idols: therefore I have made it an uncleanness to them.<li>And I will give it into the hands of strangers for spoil, and to the wicked of the earth for a prey, and they shall defile it.<li>And I will turn away my face from them, and they shall violate my secret place: and robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.<li>Make a shutting up: for the land is full of the judgment of blood, and the city is full of iniquity.<li>And I will bring the worse of the nations, and they shall possess their houses: and I will make the pride of the mighty to cease, and they shall possess their sanctuary.<li>When distress cometh upon them, they will seek for peace and there shall be none.<li>Trouble shall come upon trouble, and rumour upon rumour, and they shall seek a vision of the prophet, and the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.<li>The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with sorrow, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled. I will do to them according to their way, and will judge them according to their judgments: and they shall know that I am the Lord.</ol><h2><a name=8>Ezechiel 8</a></h2><ol><li>And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the ancients of Juda sat before me, that the hand of the Lord God fell there upon me.<li>And I saw, and behold a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins, and downward, fire: and from his loins, and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the appearance of amber.<li>And the likeness of a hand was put forth and took me by a lock of my head: and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the vision of God into Jerusalem, near the inner gate, that looked toward the north, where was set the idol of jealousy to provoke to jealousy.<li>And behold the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision which I had seen in the plain.<li>And he said to me: Son of man, lift up thy eyes towards the way of the north. And I lifted up my eyes towards the way of the north: and behold on the north side of the gate of the altar the idol of jealousy in the very entry.<li>And he said to me: Son of man, dost thou see, thinkest thou, what these are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here, that I should depart far off from my sanctuary? and turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations.<li>And he brought me in to the door of the court: and I saw, and behold a hole in the wall.<li>And he said to me: Son of man, dig in the wall. And when I had digged in the wall, behold a door.<li>And he said to me: Go in, and see the wicked abominations which they commit here.<li>And I went in and saw, and behold every form of creeping things, and of living creatures, the abomination, and all the idols of the house of Israel, were painted on the wall all round about.<li>And seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and Jezonias the son of Saaphan stood in the midst of them, that stood before the pictures: and every one had a censer in his hand: and a cloud of smoke went up from the incense.<li>And he add to me: Surely thou seest. O son of man, what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every one in private in his chamber: for they say: The Lord seeth us not, the Lord hath forsaken the earth.<li>And he said to me: If thou turn thee again, thou shalt see greater abominations which these commit.<li>And he brought me in by the door of the gate of the Lord's house, which looked to the north: and behold women sat there mourning for Adonis.<li>And he said to me: Surely thou hast seen, O son of man: but turn thee again: and thou shalt see greater abominations than these.<li>And he brought me into the inner court of the house of the Lord: and behold at the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men having their backs towards the temple of the Lord, and their faces to the east: and they adored towards the rising of the sun.<li>And he said to me: Surely thou hast seen, O son of man: is this a light thing to the house of Juda, that they should commit these abominations which they have committed here: because they have filled the land with iniquity, and have turned to provoke me to anger? and behold they put a branch to their nose.<li>Therefore I also will deal with them in my wrath: my eye shall not spare them, neither will I shew mercy: and when they shall cry to my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.</ol><h2><a name=9>Ezechiel 9</a></h2><ol><li>And he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying: The visitations of the city are at hand, and every one hath a destroying weapon in his hand.<li>And behold six men came from the way of the upper gate, which looketh to the north: and each one had his weapon of destruction in his hand: and there was one man in the midst of them clothed with linen, with a writer's inkhorn at his reins: and they went in, and stood by the brazen altar.<li>And the glory of the Lord of Israel went up from the cherub, upon which he was, to the threshold of the house: and he called to the man that was clothed with linen, and had a writer's inkhorn at his loins.<li>And the Lord said to him: Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem: and mark Thau upon the foreheads of the men that sigh, and mourn for all the abominations that are committed in the midst thereof.<li>And to the others he said in my hearing: Go ye after him through the city, and strike: let not your eyes spare, nor be ye moved with pity.<li>Utterly destroy old and young, maidens, children and women: but upon whomsoever you shall see Thau, kill him not, and begin ye at my sanctuary. So they began at the ancient men who mere before the house.<li>And he said to them: Defile the house, and ill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew them that were in the city.<li>And the slaughter being ended I was left: and I fell upon my face, and crying, I said: Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God, wilt thou then destroy all the remnant of Israel, by pouring out thy fury upon Jerusalem?<li>And he said to me: The iniquity of the house of Israel, and of Juda, is exceeding great, and the land is filled with blood, and the city is filled with perverseness: for they have said: The Lord hath forsaken the earth, and the Lord seeth not.<li>Therefore neither shall my eye spare, nor will I have pity: I will requite their way upon their head.<li>And behold the man that was clothed with linen, that had the inkhorn at his back, returned the word, saying: I have done as thou hast commanded me.</ol><h2><a name=10>Ezechiel 10</a></h2><ol><li>And saw and behold in the firmament that was over the heads of the cherubims, there appeared over them as it were the sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.<li>And he spoke to the man, that was clothed with linen, and said: Go in between the wheels that are under the cherubims and fill thy hand with the coals of fire that are between the cherubims, and pour them out upon the city. And he went in, in my sight:<li>And the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner court.<li>And the glory of the Lord was lifted up from above the cherub to the threshold of the house: and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the Lord.<li>And the sound of the wings of the cherubims was heard even to the out- ward court as the voice of God Almighty speaking.<li>And when he had commanded the man that was clothed with linen, saying: Take fire from the midst of the wheels that are between the cherubims: he went in and stood beside the wheel,<li>And one cherub stretched out his arm from the midst of the cherubims to the fire that was between the cherubims: and he took, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it and went forth.<li>And there appeared in the cherubims the likeness of a man's hand under their wings.<li>And I saw, and behold there were four wheels by the cherubims: one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by an- other cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was to the sight like the chrysolite stone:<li>And as to their appearance, all four were alike: as if a wheel were in the midst of a wheel.<li>And when they went, they went by four ways: and they turned not when they went: but to the place whither they first turned, the rest also followed, and did not turn back.<li>And their whole body, and their necks, and their hands, and their wings, and the circles were full of eyes, round about the four wheels.<li>And these wheels he called voluble, in my hearing.<li>And every one had four faces: one face was the face of a cherub, and the second face, the face of a man: and in the third was the face of a lion: and in the fourth the face of an eagle.<li>And the cherubims were lifted up: this is the living creature that I had seen by the river Chobar.<li>And when the cherubims went, the wheels also went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings, to mount up from the earth, the wheels stayed not behind, but were by them.<li>When they stood, these stood: and when they were lifted up, these were lifted up: for the spirit of life was in them.<li>And the glory of the Lord went forth from the threshold of the temple: and stood over the cherubims.<li>And the cherubims lifting up their wings, were raised from the earth before me: and as they went out, the wheels also followed: and it stood in the entry of the east gate of the house of the Lord: and the glory of the God of Israel was over them.<li>This is the living creature, which I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chobar: and I understood that they were cherubims.<li>Each one had four faces, and each one had four wings: and the likeness of a man's hand was under their wings.<li>And as to the likeness of their faces, they were the same faces which I had seen by the river Chobar, and their looks, and the impulse of every one to go straight forward.</ol><h2><a name=11>Ezechiel 11</a></h2><ol><li>And the spirit lifted me up, and brought me into the east gate of the house of the Lord, which looketh towards the rising of the sun: and behold in the entry of the gate five and twenty men: and I saw in the midst of them Jezonias the son of Azur, and Pheltias the son of Banaias, princes of the people.<li>And he said to me: Son of man, these are the men that study iniquity, and frame a wicked counsel in this city,<li>Saying: Were not houses lately built? This city is the caldron, and we the flesh.<li>Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, thou son of man.<li>And the spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and said to me: Speak: Thus saith the Lord: Thus have you spoken, O house of Israel, for I know the thoughts of your heart.<li>You have killed a great many in this city, and you have filled the streets thereof with the slain.<li>Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Your slain, whom you have laid in the midst thereof, they are the flesh, and this is the caldron: and I will bring you forth out of the midst thereof.<li>You have feared the sword, and I will bring the sword upon you, saith the Lord God.<li>And I will cast you out of the midst thereof, and I will deliver you into the hand of the enemies, and I will execute judgments upon you.<li>You shall fall by the sword: I will judge you in the borders of Israel, and you shall know that I am the Lord.<li>This shall not be as a caldron to you, and you shall not be as flesh in the midst thereof: I will judge you in the borders of Israel.<li>And you shall know that I am the Lord: because you have not walked in my commandments, and have not done my judgments, but you have done according to the judgments of the nations that; are round about you.<li>And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pheltias the son of Banaias died: and I fell down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice: and said: Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God: wilt thou make an end of all the remnant of Israel?<li>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:<li>Son of man, thy brethren, thy brethren, thy kinsmen, and all the house of Israel, all they to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said: Get ye far from the Lord, the land is given in possession to us.<li>Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Because I have removed them far off among the Gentiles, and because I have scattered them among the countries: I will be to them a little sanctuary in the countries whither they are come.<li>Therefore speak to them: Thus saith the Lord God: I will gather you from among the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries wherein you are scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.<li>And they shall go in thither, and shall take away all the scandals, and all the abominations thereof from thence.<li>And I will give them one heart, and will put a new spirit in their bowels: and I will take away the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh:<li>That they may walk in my commandments, and keep my judgments, and do them: and that they may be my people, and I may be their God.<li>But as for them whose heart walketh after their scandals and abominations, I will lay their way upon their head, saith the Lord God.<li>And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and the wheels with them: and the glory of the God of Israel was over them.<li>And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city, and stood over the mount that is on the east side of the city.<li>And the spirit lifted me up, and brought me into Chaldea, to them of the captivity, in vision, by the spirit of God: and the vision which I had seen was taken up from me.<li>And I spoke to them of the captivity all the words of the Lord, which he had shewn me.</ol><h2><a name=12>Ezechiel 12</a></h2><ol><li>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:<li>Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a provoking house: who have eyes to see, and see not: and ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a provoking house.<li>Thou, therefore, O son of man, prepare thee all necessaries for removing, and remove by day in their sight: and thou shalt remove out of thy place to another place in their sight, if so be they will regard it: for they are a provoking house.<li>And thou shalt bring forth thy furniture as the furniture of one that is removing by day in their sight: and thou shalt go forth in the evening in their presence, as one goeth forth that removeth his dwelling.<li>Dig thee a way through the wall before their eyes: and thou shalt go forth through it.<li>In their sight thou shalt be carried out upon men's shoulders, thou shalt be carried out in the dark: thou shalt cover thy face, and shalt not see the ground: for I have set thee for a sign of things to come to the house of Israel.<li>I did therefore as he had commanded me: I brought forth my goods by day, as the goods of one that removeth: and in the evening I digged through the wall with my hand: and I went forth in the dark, and was carried on men's shoulders in their sight.<li>And the word of the Lord came to me in the morning, saying:<li>Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the provoking house, said to thee: What art thou doing?<li>Say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: This burden concerneth my prince that is in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel, that are among them.<li>Say: I am a sign of things to come to you: as I have done, so shall it be done to them: they shall be removed from their dwellings, and go into captivity.<li>And the prince that is in the midst of them, shall be carried on shoulders, he shall go forth in the dark: they shall dig through the wall to bring him out: his face shall be covered, that he may not see the ground with his eyes.<li>And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my net: and I will bring him into Babylon, into the land of the Chaldeans, and he shall not see it, and there he shall die.<li>And all that are about him, his guards, and his troops I will scatter into every wind: and I will draw out the sword after them.<li>And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have dispersed them among the nations, and scattered them in the countries.<li>And I will leave a few men of them from the sword, and from the famine, and from the pestilence: that they may declare all their wicked deeds among the nations whither they shall go: and they shall know that I am the Lord.<li>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:<li>Son of man, eat thy bread in trouble: and drink thy water in hurry and sorrow.<li>And say to the people of the land: Thus saith the Lord God to them that dwell in Jerusalem in the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread in care, and drink their water in desolation: that the land may become desolate from the multitude that is therein, for the iniquity of all that dwell therein.<li>And the cities that are now inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate: and you shall know that I am the Lord.<li>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:<li>Son of man, what is this proverb that you have in the land of Israel? saying: The days shall be prolonged, and every vision shall fail.<li>Say to them therefore: Thus saith the Lord God: I will make this proverb to cease, neither shall it be any more a common saying in Israel: and tell them that the days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.<li>For there shall be no more any vain visions, nor doubtful divination in the midst of the children of Israel.<li>For I the Lord will speak: and what word soever I shall speak, it shall come to pass, and shall not be prolonged any more: but in your days, ye provoking house, I will speak the word, and will do it, saith the Lord God.<li>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:<li>Son of man, behold the house of Israel, they that say: The vision that this man seeth, is for many days to come: and this men prophesieth of times afar off.<li>Therefore say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Not one word of mine shall be prolonged any more: the word that I shall speak shall be accomplished, saith the Lord God.</ol><h2><a name=13>Ezechiel 13</a></h2><ol><li>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:<li>Son of man, prophesy thou against the prophets of Israel that prophesy: and thou shalt say to them that prophesy out of their own heart: Hear ye the word of the Lord:<li>Thus saith the Lord God: Woe to the foolish prophets that follow their own spirit, and see nothing.<li>Thy prophets, O Israel, were like foxes in the deserts.<li>You have not gone up to face the enemy, nor have you set up a wall for the house of Israel, to stand in battle in the day of the Lord.<li>They see vain things, and they foretell lies, saying: The Lord saith: whereas the Lord hath not sent them: and they have persisted to confirm what they have said.<li>Have you not seen a vain vision and spoken a lying divination: and you say: The Lord saith: whereas I have not spoken.<li>Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Because you have spoken vain things, and have seen lies: therefore behold I come against you, saith the Lord God.<li>And my hand shall be upon the prophets that see vain things, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the council of my people, nor shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel, and you shall know that I am the Lord God.<li>Because they have deceived my people, saying: Peace, and there is no peace: and the people built up a wall, and they daubed it with dirt without straw.<li>Say to them that daub without tempering, that it shall fall: for there shall be an overflowing shower, and I will cause great hailstones to fall violently from above, and a stormy wind to throw it down.<li>Behold, when the wall is fallen: shall it not be said to you: Where is the daubing wherewith you have daubed it?<li>Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Lo, I will cause a stormy wind to break forth in my indignation, and there shall be an overflowing shower in my anger: and great hailstones in my wrath to consume.<li>And I will break down the wall that you have daubed with untempered mortar: and I will make it even with the ground, and the foundation thereof shall be laid bare: and it shall fall, and shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and you shall know that I am the Lord.<li>And I will accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that daub it without tempering the mortar, and I will say to you: The wall is no more, and they that daub it are no more.<li>Even the prophets of Israel that prophesy to Jerusalem, and that see visions of peace for her: and there is no peace, saith the Lord God.<li>And thou, son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people that prophesy out of their own heart: and do thou prophesy against them,<li>And say: Thus saith the Lord God: Woe to them that sew cushions under every elbow: and make pillows for the heads of persons of every age to catch souls: and when they caught the souls of my people, they gave life to their souls.<li>And they violated me among my people, for a handful of barley, and a piece of bread, to kill souls which should not die, and to save souls alive which should not live, telling lies to my people that believe lies.<li>Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Behold I declare against your cushions, wherewith you catch flying souls: and I will tear them off from your arms: and I will let go the souls that you catch, the souls that should fly.<li>And I will tear your pillows, and will deliver my people out of your hand, neither shall they be any more in your hands to be a prey: and you shall know that I am the Lord.<li>Because with lies you have made the heart of the just to mourn, whom I have not made sorrowful: and have strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his evil way, and live.<li>Therefore you shall not see vain things, nor divine divinations any more, and I will deliver my people out of your hand: and you shall know that I am the Lord.</ol><h2><a name=14>Ezechiel 14</a></h2><ol><li>And some of the ancients of Israel came to me, and sat before me.<li>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:<li>Son of man, these men have placed their uncleannesses in their hearts, and have set up before their face the stumblingblock of their iniquity : and shall I answer when they inquire of me?<li>Therefore speak to them, and say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Man, man of the house of Israel that shall place his uncleannesses in his heart, and set up the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and shall come to the prophet inquiring of me by him: I the Lord will answer him according to the multitude of his uncleannesses:<li>That the house of Israel may be caught in their own heart, with which they have departed from me through all their idols.<li>Therefore say to the house of Israel: Thus saith the Lord God: Be converted, and depart from your idols, and turn away your faces from all your abominations.<li>For every man of the house of Israel, and every stranger among the proselytes in Israel, if he separate himself from me, and place his idols in his heart, and set the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and come to the prophet to inquire of me by him: I the Lord will answer him by myself.<li>And I will set my face against that man, and will make him an example, and a proverb, and will cut him off from the midst of my people: and you shall know that I am the Lord.<li>And when the prophet shall err, and speak a word: I the Lord have deceived that prophet: and I will stretch forth my hand upon him, and will cut him off from the midst of my people Israel.<li>And they shall bear their iniquity: according to the iniquity of him that inquireth, so shall the iniquity of the prophet be.<li>That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, nor be polluted with all their transgressions: but may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord of hosts.<li>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:<li>Son of man, when a land shall sin against me, so as to transgress grievously, I will stretch forth my hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof: and I will send famine upon it, and will destroy man and beast out of it.<li>And if these three men, Noe, Daniel, and Job, shall be in it: they shall deliver their own souls by their justice, saith the Lord of hosts.<li>And if I shall bring mischievous beasts also upon the land to waste it, and it be desolate, so that there is none that can pass because of the beasts:<li>If these three men shall be in it, as I live, saith the Lord, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters: but they only shall be delivered, and the land shall be made desolate.<li>Or if I bring the sword upon that land, and say to the sword: Pass through the land: and I destroy man and beast out of it:<li>And these three men be in the midst thereof: as I live, saith the Lord God, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they themselves alone shall be delivered.<li>Or if I also send the pestilence upon that land, and pour out my indignation upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast:<li>And Noe, and Daniel, and Job be in the midst thereof: as I live, saith the Lord God, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter: but they shall only deliver their own souls by their justice.<li>For thus saith the Lord: Although I shall send in upon Jerusalem my four grievous judgments, the sword, and the famine, and the mischievous beasts, and the pestilence, to destroy out of it man and beast,<li>Yet there shall be left in it some that shall be saved, who shall bring away their sons and daughters: behold they shall come among you, and you shall see their way, and their doings: and you shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, in all things that I have brought upon it.<li>And they shall comfort you, when you shall see their ways, and their doings : and you shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord God.</ol><h2><a name=15>Ezechiel 15</a></h2><ol><li>And the word of the

work, or shall a pin be made of it for any vessel to hang thereon?<li>Behold it is cast into the fire for fuel: the fire hath consumed both ends thereof, and the midst thereof is reduced to ashes: shall it be useful for any work?<li>Even when it was whole it was not fit for work: how much less, when the fire hath devoured and consumed it, shall any work be made of it?<li>Therefore thus saith the Lord God: As the vine tree among the trees of the forests which I have given to the fire to be consumed, so will I deliver up the inhabitants of Jerusalem.<li>And I will set my face against them: they shall go out from fire, and fire shall consume them : and you shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have set my face against them.<li>And I shall have made their land a wilderness, and desolate, because they have been transgressors, saith the Lord God.</ol><h2><a name=16>Ezechiel 16</a></h2><ol><li>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:<li>Son of man, make known to Jerusalem her abominations.<li>And thou shalt say: Thus saith the Lord God to Jerusalem: Thy root, and thy nativity is of the land of Chanaan, thy father was an Amorrhite, and thy mother a Cethite.<li>And when thou wast born, in the day of thy nativity thy navel wits not cut, neither wast thou washed with water for thy health, nor salted with salt, nor swaddled with clouts.<li>No eye had pity on thee to do any of these things for thee, out of compassion to thee: but thou wast cast out upon the face of the earth in the abjection of thy soul, in the day that thou wast born.<li>And passing by thee, I saw that thou wast trodden under foot in thy own blood. and I said to thee when thou wast in thy blood: Live: I have said to thee: Live in thy blood.<li>I caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field: and thou didst increase and grow great, and advancedst, and camest to woman's ornament: thy breasts were fashioned, and thy hair grew: and thou wast naked, and full of confusion.<li>And I passed by thee, and saw thee: and behold thy time was the time of lovers : and I spread my garment over thee, and covered thy ignominy. And I swore to thee, and I entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord God: and thou becamest mine.<li>And I washed thee with water, and cleansed away thy blood from thee: and I anointed thee with oil.<li>And I clothed thee with embroidery, and shed thee with violet coloured shoes : and I girded thee about with fine linen, and clothed thee with fine garments.<li>I decked thee also with ornaments, and put bracelets on thy hands, and a chain about thy neck.<li>And I put a jewel upon thy forehead and earrings in thy ears, and a beautiful crown upon thy head.<li>And thou wast adorned with gold, and silver, and wast clothed with fine linen, and embroidered work, and many colours: thou didst eat fine hour, and honey, and oil, and wast made exceeding beautiful: and wast advanced to be a queen.<li>And thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty: for thou wast perfect through my beauty, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord God.<li>But trusting in thy beauty, thou playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and thou hast prostituted thyself to every passenger, to be his.<li>And taking of thy garments thou hast made thee high places sewed together on each side: and hast played the harlot upon them, as hath not been done before, nor shall be hereafter.<li>And thou tookest thy beautiful vessels, of my gold, and my silver, which I gave thee, and thou madest thee images of men, and hast committed fornication with them.<li>And thou tookest thy garments of divers colours, and coveredst them : and settest my oil and my sweet incense before them.<li>And my bread which I gave thee, the fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast set before them for a sweet odour; and it was done, saith the Lord God.<li>And thou hast taken thy sons, and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne to me: and best sacrificed the same to them to be devoured. Is thy fornication small?<li>Thou hast sacrificed and given my children to them, consecrating them by fire.<li>And after all thy abominations, and fornications, thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked, and full of confusion, trodden under foot in thy own blood.<li>And it came to pass after all thy wickedness (woe, woe to thee, saith the Lord God)<li>That thou didst also build thee a common stew, and madest thee a brothel house in every street.<li>At every head of the way thou hast set up a sign of thy prostitution: and hast made thy beauty to be abominable: and hast prostituted thyself to every one that passed by, and hast multiplied thy fornications.<li>And thou hast committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, men of large bodies, and hast multiplied thy fornications to provoke me.<li>Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon thee, and will take away thy justification: and I will deliver thee up to the will of the daughters of the Philistines that hate thee, that are ashamed of thy wicked way.<li>Thou hast also committed fornication with the Assyrians, because thou wast not yet satisfied: and after thou hadst played the harlot with them, even so thou wast not contented.<li>Thou hast also multiplied thy fornications in the land of Chanaan with the Chaldeans: and neither so wast then satisfied.<li>Wherein shall I cleanse thy heart, saith the Lord God: seeing thou dost all these the works of a shameless prostitute?<li>Because thou hast built thy brothel house at the head of every way, and thou hast made thy high place in every street: and wast not as a harlot that by disdain enhanceth her price,<li>But as an adulteress, that bringeth in strangers over her husband.<li>Gifts are given to all harlots: but thou hast given hire to all thy lovers, and thou hast given them gifts to come to thee from every side, to commit fornication with thee.<li>And it hath happened in thee contrary to the custom of women in thy fornications, and after thee there shall be no such fornication: for in that thou gavest rewards, and didst not take rewards, the contrary hath been done in thee.<li>Therefore, O harlot, hear the word of the Lord.<li>Thus saith the Lord God: Because thy money hath been poured out, and thy shame discovered through thy fornications with thy lovers, and with the idols of thy abominations, by the blood of thy children whom thou gavest them:<li>Behold, I will gather together all thy lovers with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all whom thou hast loved, with all whom thou hast hated: and I will gather them together against thee on every side, and will discover thy shame in their sight, and they shall see all thy nakedness.<li>And I will judge thee as adulteresses, and they that shed blood are judged: and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.<li>And I will deliver thee into their hands, and they shall destroy thy brothel house, and throw down thy stews: and they shall strip thee of thy garments, and shall take away the vessels of thy beauty: and leave thee naked, and full of disgrace.<li>And they shall bring upon thee a multitude, and they shall stone thee with stones, and shall slay thee with their swords.<li>41And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and shall execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and thou shalt cease from fornication, and shalt give no hire any more.<li>And my indignation shall rest in thee: and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will cease and be angry no more.<li>Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast provoked me in all these things: wherefore I also have turned thy ways upon thy head, saith the Lord God, and I have not done according to thy wicked deeds in all thy abominations.<li>Behold every one that useth a common proverb, shall use this against thee, saying: As the mother was, so also is her daughter.<li>Thou art thy mother's daughter, that cast off her husband, and her children: and thou art the sister of thy sisters, who cast off their husbands, and their children: your mother was a Cethite, and your father an Amorrhite.<li>And thy elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister that dwelleth at thy right hand is Sodom, and her daughters.<li>But neither hast thou walked in their ways, nor hast thou done a little less than they according to their wickednesses: thou hast done almost more wicked things than they in all thy ways<li>as I live, saith the Lord God, thy sister Sodom herself, and her daughters, have not done as thou hast done, and thy daughters.<li>Behold this was the iniquity of Sodom thy sister, pride, fulness of bread, and abundance, and the idleness of her, and of her daughters: and they did not put forth their hand to the needy, and to the poor.<li>And they were lifted up, and committed abominations before me: and I took them away as thou hast seen.<li>And Samaria committed not half thy sins: but thou hast surpassed them with thy crimes, and hast justified thy sisters by all thy abominations which thou hast done.<li>Therefore do thou also bear thy confusion, thou that hast surpassed thy sisters with thy sine, doing more wickedly than they: for they are justified above thee, therefore be thou also confounded, and bear thy shame, thou that hast justified thy sisters.<li>And I will bring back and restore them by bringing back Sodom, with her daughters, and by bringing back Samaria, and her daughters: and I will bring those that return of thee in the midst of them.<li>That thou mayest bear thy shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, comforting them.<li>And thy sister Sodom and her daughters shall return to their ancient state: and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their ancient state: and thou and thy daughters shall return to your ancient state.<li>And Sodom thy sister was not heard of in thy mouth, in the day of thy pride,<li>Before thy malice was laid open: as it is at this time, making thee a reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all the daughters of Palestine round about thee, that encompass thee on all sides.<li>Thou hast borne thy wickedness, and thy disgrace, saith the Lord God.<li>For thus saith the Lord God: I will deal with thee, as thou hast despised the oath, in breaking the covenant:<li>And I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth: and I will establish with thee an everlasting covenant.<li>And thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed: when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thy elder and thy younger: and I will give them to thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.<li>And I will establish my covenant with thee: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord,<li>That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and mayest no more open thy mouth because of thy confusion, when I shall be pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord God.</ol><h2><a name=17>Ezechiel 17</a></h2><ol><li>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:<li>Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable to the house of Israel,<li>And say: Thus saith

waters: he planted it on the surface of the earth.<li>And it sprung up and grew into a spreading vine of low stature, and the branches thereof looked towards him: and the roots thereof were under him. So it became a vine, and grew into branches, and shot forth sprigs.<li>And there was another large eagle, with great wings, and many feathers: and behold this vine, bending as it were her roots towards him, stretched forth her branches to him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation.<li>It was planted in a good ground upon many waters, that it might bring forth branches, and bear fruit, that it might become a large vine.<li>Say thou: Thus saith the Lord God: Shall it prosper then? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and strip off its fruit, and dry up all the branches it hath shot forth, and make it wither: and this without a strong arm, or many people, to pluck it up by the root?<li>Behold, it is planted: shall it prosper then? shall it not be dried up when the burning wind shall touch it, and shall it not wither in the furrows where it grew?<li>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:<li>Say to the provoking house: Know you not what these things mean? Tell them: Behold the king of Babylon cometh to Jerusalem: and he shall take away the king and the princes thereof, and carry them with him to Babylon.<li>And he shall take one of the king's seed, and make a covenant with him, and take an oath of him. Yea, and he shall take away the mighty men of the land,<li>That it may be a low kingdom and not lift itself up, but keep his covenant, and observe it.<li>But he hath revolted from him and sent ambassadors to Egypt, that it might give him horses, and much people. And shall he that hath done thus prosper, or be saved? and shall he escape that hath broken the covenant?<li>As I live, saith the Lord God: In the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he hath made void, and whose covenant he broke, even in the midst of Babylon shall he die.<li>And not with a great army, nor with much people shall Pharao fight against him: when he shall cast up mounts, and build forts, to cut off many souls.<li>For he had despised the oath, breaking his covenant, and behold he hath given his hand: and having done all these things, he shall not escape.<li>Therefore thus saith the Lord God: As I live, I will lay upon his head the oath he hath despised, and the covenant he hath broken.<li>And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my net: and I will bring him into Babylon, and will judge him there for the transgression by which he hath despised me.<li>And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword: and the residue shall be scattered into every wind: and you shall know that I the Lord have spoken.<li>Thus saith the Lord God: I myself will take of the marrow of the high cedar, and will set it: I will crop off a tender twig from the top of the branches thereof, and I will plant it on a mountain high and eminent.<li>On the high mountains of Israel will I plant it, and it shall shoot forth into branches, and shall bear fruit, and it shall become a great cedar: and all birds shall dwell under it, and every fowl shall make its nest under the shadow of the branches thereof.<li>And all the trees of the country shall know that I the Lord have brought down the high tree, and exalted the low tree: and have dried up the green tree, and have caused the dry tree to flourish. I the Lord have spoken and have done it.</ol><h2><a name=18>Ezechiel 18</a></h2><ol><li>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: What is the meaning?<li>That you use among you this parable as a proverb in the land of Israel, saying: The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the teeth of the children are set on edge.<li>As I live, saith the Lord God, this parable shall be no more to you a proverb in Israel.<li>Behold all souls are mine: as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, the same shall die.<li>And if a man be just, and do judgment and justice,<li>And hath not eaten upon the mountains, nor lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel: and hath not defiled his neighbour's wife, nor come near to a menstruous woman:<li>And hath not wronged any man: but hath restored the pledge to the debtor, hath taken nothing away by violence: hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment:<li>Hath not lent upon usury, nor taken any increase: hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, and hath executed true judgment between man and man:<li>Hath walked in my commandments, and kept my judgments, to do truth: he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord God.<li>And if he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that hath done some one of these things:<li>Though he doth not all these things, but that eateth upon the mountains, and that defileth his neighbour's wife:<li>That grieveth the needy and the poor, that taketh away by violence, that restoreth not the pledge, and that lifteth up his eyes to idols, that committeth abomination:<li>That giveth upon usury, and that taketh an increase: shall such a one live? he shall not live. Seeing he hath done all these detestable things, he shall surely die, his blood shall be upon him.<li>But if he beget a son, who, seeing all his father's sine, which he hath done, is afraid, and shall not do the like to them :<li>That hath not eaten upon the mountains, nor lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, and hath not defiled his neighbour's wife:<li>And hath not grieved any man, nor withholden the pledge, nor taken away with violence, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and covered the naked with a garment:<li>That hath turned away his hand from injuring the poor, hath not taken usury and increase, but hath executed my judgments, and hath walked in my commandments: this man shall not die for the iniquity of his father, but living he shall live.<li>As for his father, because he oppressed and offered violence to his brother, and wrought evil in the midst of his people, behold he is dead in his own iniquity.<li>And you say: Why hath not the son borne the iniquity of his father? Verily, because the son hath wrought judgment and justice, hath kept all my commandments, and done them, living, he shall live.<li>The soul that sinneth, the same shall die: the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, and the father shall not bear the iniquity of the son: the justice of the just shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.<li>But if the wicked do penance for all his sins which he hath committed, and keep all my commandments, and do judgment, and justice, living he shall live, and shall not die.<li>I will not remember all his iniquities that he hath done: in his justice which he hath wrought, he shall live.<li>Is it my will that a sinner should die, saith the Lord God, and not that he should be converted from his ways, and live?<li>But if the just man turn himself away from his justice, and do iniquity according to all the abominations which the wicked man useth to work, shall he live? all his justices which he hath done, shall not be remembered: in the prevarication, by which he hath prevaricated, and in his sin, which he hath committed, in them he shall die.<li>And you have said: The way of the Lord is not right. Hear ye, therefore, O house of Israel: Is it my way that is not right, and are not rather your ways perverse?<li>For when the just turneth himself away from his justice, and committeth iniquity, he shall die therein: in the injustice that he hath wrought he shall die.<li>And when the wicked turneth himself away from his wickedness, which he hath wrought, and doeth judgment, and justice: he shall save his soul alive.<li>Because he considereth and turneth away himself from all his iniquities which he hath wrought, he shall surely live, and not die.<li>And the children of Israel say: The way of the Lord is not right. Are not my ways right, O house of Israel, and are not rather your ways perverse?<li>Therefore will I judge every man according to his ways, O house of Israel, saith the Lord God. Be converted, and do penance for all your iniquities: and iniquity shall not be your ruin.<li>Cast away from you all your transgressions, by which you have transgressed, and make to yourselves a new heart, and a new spirit: and why will you die, O house of Israel?<li>For I desire not the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord God, return ye and live.</ol><h2><a name=19>Ezechiel 19</a></h2><ol><li>Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,<li>And say: Why did thy mother the lioness lie down among the lions, and bring up her whelps in the midst of young lions?<li>And she brought out one of her whelps, and he became a lion: and he learned to catch the prey, and to devour men.<li>And the nations heard of him, and took him, but not without receiving wounds: and they brought him in chains into the land of Egypt.<li>But she seeing herself weakened, and that her hope was lost, took one of her young lions, and set him up for a lion.<li>And he went up and down among the lions, and became a lion: and he learned to catch the prey, and to devour men.<li>He learned to make widows, and to lay waste their cities: and the land became desolate, and the fulness thereof by the noise of his roaring.<li>And the nations Game together against him on every side out of the provinces, and they spread their net over him, in their wounds he was taken.<li>And they put him into a cage, they brought him in chains to the king of Babylon: and they cast him into prison, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.<li>Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood planted by the water: her fruit and her branches have grown out of many waters.<li>And she hath strong rods to make sceptres for them that bear rule, and her stature was exalted among the branches: and she saw her height in the multitude of her branches.<li>But she was plucked up in wrath, and cast on the ground, and the burning wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods are withered, and dried up: the fire hath devoured her.<li>And now she is transplanted into the desert, in a land not passable, and dry.<li>And a fire is gone out from a rod of her branches, which hath devoured her fruit: so that she now hath no strong rod, to be a sceptre of rulers.

doted.<li>They discovered her disgrace, took away her sons and daughters, and slew her with the sword: and they became infamous women, and they executed judgments in her.<li>And when her sister Ooliba

fornications, remembering the days of her youth, in which she played the harlot in the land of Egypt.<li>And she was mad with lust after lying with them whose flesh is as the flesh of asses: and whose issue as the issue of horses.<li>And thou hast renewed the wickedness of thy youth, when thy breasts were pressed in Egypt, and the papa of thy virginity broken.<li>Therefore, Ooliba, thus saith the

before them, and they shall judge thee by their judgments.<li>And I will set my jealousy against thee, which they shall execute upon thee with fury: they shall cut off thy nose and thy ears: and what remains shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons, and thy daughters, and thy residue shall be devoured by fire.<li>And they shall strip thee of thy garments, and take away the instruments of thy glory.<li>And I will put an end to thy wickedness in thee, and thy fornication brought out of the land of Egypt: neither shalt thou lift up thy eyes to them, nor remember Egypt any more.<li>For thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will deliver thee into the hands of them whom thou hatest, into their hands with whom thy soul hath been glutted.<li>And they shall deal with thee in hatred, and

back, bear thou also thy wickedness, and thy fornications.<li>And the Lord spoke to me, saying: Son of man, dost thou judge Oolla, and Ooliba, and dost thou declare to them their wicked deeds?<li>Because they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and they have committed fornication with their idols: moreover also their children, whom they bore to me, they have offered

They polluted my sanctuary on the same day, and profaned my sabbaths.<li>And when they sacrificed their children to their idols, and went into my sanctuary the same day to profane it: they did these things even in the midst of my house.<li>They sent for men coming from afar, to whom they had sent a messenger: and behold they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, and didst paint thy eyes, and wast adorned with women's ornaments.<li>Thou sattest on a very fine bed, and a table was decked before thee: whereupon thou didst set my incense, and my ointment.<li>And there was in her the voice of a multitude rejoicing: and to some that were brought of the multitude of men, and that came from the desert, they put bracelets on their hands, and beautiful crowns on their heads.<li>And I said to her that was worn out in her adulteries: Now will this woman still continue in her fornication.<li>And they went in to her, as to a harlot: so went they in unto Oolla, and Ooliba, wicked women.<li>They therefore are k just men: these shall judge them as adulteresses are judged, and as shedders of blood are judged: because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.<li>For thus saith the Lord God: Bring a multitude upon them, and deliver them over to tumult and rapine:<li>And lee the people stone them with stones, and let them be stabbed with their swords: they shall kill their sons and daughters, and their houses they shall burn with fire.<li>And I will take away wickedness out of the land: and all women shall learn, not to do according to the wickedness of them.<li>And they shall render your wickedness upon you, and you shall bear the sins of your idols: and you shall know that I am the Lord God.</ol><h2><a name=24>Ezechiel 24</a></h2><ol><li>And the

rust is not gone out of it: cast it out piece by piece, there hath no lot fallen upon it.<li>For her blood is in the midst of her, she hath shed it upon the smooth rock: she hath not shed it upon the ground, that it might be covered with dust.<li>And that I might bring my indignation upon her, and take my vengeance: I have shed her blood upon the smooth rock, that it should not be covered.<li>Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Woe to the bloody city, of which I will make a great bonfire.<li>Heap together the bones, which I will burn with Are: the flesh shall be consumed, and

milk, end you clothed yourselves with the wool, and you killed that which was fat: but my flock you did not feed.<li>The weak you have not strengthened, and that which was sick you have not healed, that which was broken you have not bound up, and that which was driven away you have not brought again, neither have you sought that which was lost: but you ruled over them with rigour, and with a high hand.<li>And my sheep were scattered, because there was no shepherd: and they became the prey of all the beasts of the field, and were scattered.<li>My sheep have wandered in every mountain, and in every high hill: and my flocks mere scattered upon the face of the earth, and there was none that sought them, there was none, I say, that sought them.<li>Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of

shepherds did not seek after my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flocks:<li>Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the Lord:<li>Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I myself come upon the shepherds, I will require my hock at their hand, and I will cause them to cease from feeding the flock any more, neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more: and I will deliver my flock from their mouth, and it shall no more be meat for them.<li>For thus saith the Lord God: Behold I myself will seek my sheep, and will visit them.<li>As the shepherd visiteth his hock in the day when he shall be in the midst of his sheep that were scattered, so will I visit my sheep, and will deliver them out of all the places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.<li>And I will bring them out from the peoples, and will gather them out of the countries, and will bring them to their own land: and I will feed them in the mountains of Israel, by the rivers, and in all the habitations of the land.<li>I will feed them in the most fruitful pastures, and their pastures shall be in the high mountains of Israel: there shall they rest on the green grass, and be fed in fat pastures upon the mountains of Israel.<li>I will feed my sheep : and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord God.<li>I will seek that which was lost: and that which was driven away, I will bring again: and I will bind up that which was broken, and I will strengthen that which was weak, and that which was fat and strong I will preserve: and I will feed them in judgment.<li>And as for you, O my flocks, thus saith the Lord God: Behold I judge between cattle and cattle, of rams and of he goats.<li>Was it not enough for you to feed upon good pastures? but you must also tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures: and when you drank the dearest water, you troubled the rest with your feet.<li>And my sheep were fed with that which you had trodden with your feet: and they drank what your feet had troubled.<li>Therefore thus saith the Lord God to you: Behold, I myself will judge between the fat cattle and the lean.<li>Because you thrusted with sides and shoulders, and struck all the weak cattle with your horns, till they were scattered abroad:<li>I will save my dock, and it shall be no more a spoil, and I will judge between cattle and cattle.<li>AND I WILL SET UP ONE SHEPHERD OVER THEM, and he shall feed them, even my servant David: he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.<li>And I the Lord will be their God: and my servant David the prince in the midst of them: I the Lord have spoken it.<li>And I will make a covenant of peace with them, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they that dwell in the wilderness shall sleep secure in the forests.<li>And I will make them a blessing round about my hill: and I will send down the rain in its season, there shall be showers of blessing.<li>And the tree of the field shall yield its fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be in their land without fear: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have broken the bonds of their yoke, and shall have delivered them out of the hand of those that rule over them.<li>And they shall be no more for a spoil to the nations, neither shall the beasts of the earth devour them: but they shall dwell securely without any terror.<li>And I will raise up for them a bud of renown: and they shall be no more consumed with famine in the land, neither shall they bear any more the reproach of the Gentiles.<li>And they shall know that I the Lord their God am with them, and that they are my people the house of Israel: saith the Lord God.<li>And you my flocks, the flocks of my pasture are men: and I am the Lord your God,

me with your mouth, and have derogated from me by your words: I have heard them.<li>Thus saith the Lord God: When the whole earth shall rejoice, I will make thee a wilderness.<li>As thou best rejoiced

upon the ground, and all men that are upon the face of the earth, shall be moved at my presence: and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the hedges shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.<li>And I will call in the sword against him in all my mountains, saith the Lord God: every man's sword shall be pointed against his brother.<li>And I will judge him with pestilence, and with blood, and with violent rain, and vast hailstones: I will rain fire and brimstone upon him, and upon his army, and upon the many nations that are with him.<li>And I will be magnified, and I will be sanctified: and I will be known in the eyes of many nations: and they shall know that I am the Lord.</ol><h2><a name=39>Ezechiel 39</a></h2><ol><li>And thou, son of man, prophesy against Cog, and say:

parts: and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel.<li>And I will break thy bow in thy left hand, and I will cause thy arrows to fall out of thy right hand.<li>Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou and all thy bands, and thy nations that are with thee: I have given thee to the wild beasts, to the birds, and to every fowl, and to the beasts of the earth to be devoured.<li>Thou shalt fall upon the face of the field: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord God.<li>And I will send a fire on Magog, and on them that dwell confidently in the islands: and they shall know that I am the Lord.<li>And I will make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel, and my holy name shall be profaned no more: and the Gentiles shall know that I am the Lord, the Holy One of Israel.<li>Behold it cometh, and it is done, saith the Lord God: this is the day whereof I have spoken.<li>And the inhabitants shall go forth of the cities of Israel, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, the shields, and the spears, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves and the pikes: and they shall burn them with fire seven years.<li>And they shall not bring wood out of the countries, nor cut down out of the forests: for they shall burn the weapons with fire, and shall make a prey of them to whom they had been a prey, and they shall rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord God.<li>And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give Gog a noted place for a sepulchre in Israel: the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea, which shall cause astonishment in them that pass by: and there shall they bury Cog, and all his multitude, and it shall be called the valley of the multitude of Cog.<li>And the house of Israel shall bury them for seven months to cleanse the land.<li>And all the people of the land shall bury him, and it shall be unto them a noted day, wherein I was glorified, saith the Lord God.<li>And they shall appoint men to go continually about the land, to bury and to seek out them that were remaining upon the face of the earth, that they may cleanse it: and after seven months they shall begin to seek.<li>And they shall go about passing through the land: and when they shall see the bone of a man, they shall set up a sign by it, till the buriers bury it in the valley of the multitude of Cog.<li>And the name of the city shall be Amona, and they shall cleanse the land.<li>And thou, O son of man, saith the Lord God, say to every fowl, and to all the birds, and to all the beasts of the field: Assemble yourselves, make haste, come together from every side to my victim, which I slay for you, a great victim upon the mountains of Israel: to eat flesh, and drink blood.<li>You shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and you shall drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, and of lambs, and of he goats, and bullocks, and of all that are well fed and fat.<li>And you shall eat the fat till you be full, and shall drink blood till you be drunk of the victim which I shall slay for you.<li>And you shall be filled at my table with horses, and mighty horsemen, and all the men of war, saith the Lord God.<li>And I will set my glory among the nations: and all nations shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them.<li>And the house of Israel shall know that I am the Lord their God from that day and forward.<li>And the nations shall know that the house of Israel were made captives for their iniquity, because they forsook me, and I hid my face from them: and I delivered them into the hands of their enemies, and they fell all by the sword.<li>I have dealt with them according to their uncleanness, and wickedness, and hid my face from them.<li>Therefore, thus saith the Lord God: Now will I bring back the captivity of Jacob, and will have mercy on all the house of Israel: and I will be jealous for my holy name.<li>And they shall bear their confusion, and all the transgressions wherewith they have transgressed against me, when they shall dwell in their land securely fearing no man:<li>And I shall have brought them back from among the nations, and shall have gathered them together out of the lands of their enemies, and shall be sanctified in them, in the sight of many nations.<li>And they shall know that I am the Lord their God, because I caused them to be carried away among the nations; and I have gathered them together unto their own land, and have not left any of them there.<li>And I will hide my face no more from them, for I have poured out my spirit upon all the house of Israel, saith the Lord God.</ol><h2><a name=40>Ezechiel 40</a></h2><ol><li>In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, the tenth day of the month, the
