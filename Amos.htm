<ol>
<li><span>The words of Amos, who was among herdsmen of Thecua:
which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Ozias king of Juda,
and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joas king of Israel two
years before the earthquake.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said: The Lord will roar from Sion, and utter his
voice from Jerusalem: and the beautiful places of the shepherds
have mourned, and the top of Carmel is withered.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Damascus, and
for four I will not convert it: because they have thrashed Galaad
with iron wains.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will send a fire into the house of Azael, and it
shall devour the houses of Benadad.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will break the bar of Damascus: and I will cut off
the inhabitants from the plain of the idol, and him that holdeth
the sceptre from the house of pleasure: and the people of Syria
shall be carried away to Cyrene, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Gaza, and for
four I will not convert it: because they have carried away a
perfect captivity to shut them up in Edom.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, and it shall
devour the houses thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will cut off the inhabitant from Azotus, and him
that holdeth the sceptre from Ascalon: and I will turn my hand
against Accaron, and the rest of the Philistines shall perish,
saith the Lord God.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Tyre, and for
four I will not convert it: because they have shut up an entire
captivity in Edom, and have not remembered the covenant of
brethren.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will send a fire upon the wall of Tyre, and it
shall devour the houses thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Edom, and for
four I will not convert him: because he hath pursued his brother
with the sword, and hath cast off all pity, and hath carried on his
fury, and hath kept his wrath to the end.</span></li>
<li><span>I will send a fire into Theman: and it shall devour the
houses of Bosra.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of the children of
Ammon, and for four I will not convert him: because he hath ripped
up the women with child of Galaad to enlarge his
border.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabba: and it
shall devour the houses thereof with shouting in the day of battle,
and with a whirlwind in the day of trouble.</span></li>
<li><span>And Melchom shall go into captivity, both he, and his
princes together, saith the Lord.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="2">Amos 2</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Moab, and for
four I will not convert him: because he hath burnt the bones of the
king of Edom even to ashes.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will seed a fire into Moab, and it shall devour the
houses of Carioth: and Moab shall die with a noise, with the sound
of the trumpet:</span></li>
<li><span>And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and
will slay all his princes with him, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Juda, and for
four I will not convert him: because he hath cast away the law of
the Lord, and hath not kept his commandments: for their idols have
caused them to err, after which their fathers have
walked.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will send a fire into Juda, and it shall devour the
houses of Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: For three crimes of Israel, and for
four I will not convert him: because he hath sold the just man for
silver, and the poor man for a pair of shoes.</span></li>
<li><span>They bruise the heads of the poor upon the dust of the
earth, and turn aside the way of the humble: and the son and his
father have gone to the same young woman, to profane my holy
name.</span></li>
<li><span>And they sat down upon garments laid to pledge by every
altar: and drank the wine of the condemned in the house of their
God.</span></li>
<li><span>Yet I cast out the Amorrhite before their face: whose
height was like the height of cedars, and who was strong as an oak:
and I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots
beneath.</span></li>
<li><span>It is I that brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and
I led you forty years through the wilderness, that you might
possess the land of the Amorrhite.</span></li>
<li><span>And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your
young men for Nazarites. Is it not so, O ye children of Israel,
saith the Lord?</span></li>
<li><span>And you will present wine to the Nazarites: and command
the prophets, saying: Prophesy not.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold, I will screak under you as a wain screaketh that
is laden with hay.</span></li>
<li><span>And flight shall perish from the swift, and the valiant
shall not possess his strength, neither shall the strong save his
life.</span></li>
<li><span>And he that holdeth the bow shall not stand, and the
swift of foot shall not escape, neither shall the rider of the
horse save his life.</span></li>
<li><span>And the stout of heart among the valiant shall flee away
naked in that day, saith the Lord.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="3">Amos 3</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Hear the word that the Lord hath spoken concerning you, O
ye children of Israel: concerning the whole family that I brought
up out of the land of Egypt, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>You only have I known of all the families of the earth:
therefore will I visit upon you all your iniquities.</span></li>
<li><span>Shall two walk together except they be
agreed?</span></li>
<li><span>Will a lion roar in the forest, if he have no prey? will
the lion's whelp cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing
?</span></li>
<li><span>Will the bird fall into the snare upon the earth, if
there be no fowler? Shall the snare be taken up from the earth,
before it hath taken somewhat ?</span></li>
<li><span>Shall the trumpet sound in a city, and the people not be
afraid? Shall there be evil in a city, which the Lord hath not
done?</span></li>
<li><span>For the Lord God doth nothing without revealing his
secret to his servants the prophets.</span></li>
<li><span>The lion shall roar, who will not fear? The Lord God hath
spoken, who shall not prophesy?</span></li>
<li><span>Publish it in the houses of Azotus, and in the houses of
the land of Egypt, and say: Assemble yourselves upon the mountains
of Samaria, and behold the many follies in the midst thereof, and
them that suffer oppression in the inner rooms thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>And they have not known to do the right thing, saith the
Lord, storing up iniquity, and robberies in their
houses.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord God: The land shall be in
tribulation, and shall be compassed about: and thy strength shall
be taken away from thee, and thy houses shall be
spoiled.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: As if a shepherd should get out of
the lion's mouth two legs, or the tip of the ear: so shall the
children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria, in a piece
of a bed, and in the couch of Damascus.</span></li>
<li><span>Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the
Lord the God of hosts:</span></li>
<li><span>That in the day when I shall begin to visit the
transgressions of Israel, I will visit upon him, and upon the
altars of Bethel: and the horns of the altars shall be cut off, and
shall fall to the ground.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will strike the winter house with the summer house:
and the houses of ivory shall perish, and many houses shall be
destroyed, saith the Lord.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="4">Amos 4</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Hear this word, ye fat kine that are in the mountains of
Samaria: you that oppress the needy, and crush the poor: that say
to your masters: Bring, and we will drink.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord God hath sworn by his holiness, that lo, the
days shall come upon you, when they shall lift you up on pikes, and
what shall remain of you in boiling pots.</span></li>
<li><span>And you shall go out at the breaches one over against the
other, and you shall be cast forth into Armon, saith the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Come ye to Bethel, and do wickedly: to Galgal, and
multiply transgressions: and bring in the morning your victims,
your tithes in three days.</span></li>
<li><span>And offer a sacrifice of praise with leaven: and call
free offerings, and proclaim it: for so you would do, O children of
Israel, saith the Lord God.</span></li>
<li><span>Whereupon I also have given you dulness of teeth in all
your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet you have not
returned to me, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>I also have withholden the rain from you, when there were
yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one
city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was
rained upon: and the piece whereupon I rained not,
withered.</span></li>
<li><span>And two and three cities went to one city to drink water,
and were not filled: yet you returned not to me, saith the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>I struck you with a burning wind, and with mildew, the
palmerworm hath eaten up your many gardens, and your vineyards:
your olive groves, and fig groves: yet you returned not to me,
saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>I sent death upon you in the way of Egypt, I slew your
young men with the sword, even to the captivity of your horses: and
I made the stench of your camp to come up into your nostrils: yet
you returned not to me, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>I destroyed some of you, as God destroyed Sodom and
Gomorrha, and you were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning:
yet you returned not to me, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore I will do these things to thee, O Israel: and
after I shall have done these things to thee, be prepared to meet
thy God, O Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>For behold he that formeth the mountains and createth the
wind, and declareth his word to man, he that maketh the morning
mist, and walketh upon the high places of the earth: the Lord the
God of hosts is his name.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="5">Amos 5</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Hear ye this word, which I take up concerning you for a
lamentation. The house of Israel is fallen, and it shall rise no
more.</span></li>
<li><span>The virgin of Israel is cast down upon her land, there is
none to raise her up.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord God: The city, out of which came
forth a thousand, there shall be left in it a hundred: and out of
which there came a hundred, there shall be left in it ten, in the
house of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord to the house of Israel: Seek ye
me, and you shall live.</span></li>
<li><span>But seek not Bethel, and go not into Galgal, neither
shall you pass over to Bersabee: for Galgal shall go into
captivity, and Bethel shall be unprofitable.</span></li>
<li><span>Seek ye the Lord, and live: lest the house of Joseph be
burnt with fire, and it shall devour, and there shall be none to
quench Bethel.</span></li>
<li><span>You that turn judgment into wormwood, and forsake justice
in the land,</span></li>
<li><span>Seek him that maketh Arcturus, and Orion, and that
turneth darkness into morning, and that changeth day into night:
that calleth the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the
face of the earth: The Lord is his name.</span></li>
<li><span>He that with a smile bringeth destruction upon the
strong, and waste upon the mighty.</span></li>
<li><span>They have hated him that rebuketh in the gate: and have
abhorred him that speaketh perfectly.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore because you robbed the poor, and took the
choice prey from him: you shall build houses with square stone, and
shall not dwell in them: you shall plant most delightful vineyards,
and shall not drink the wine of them.</span></li>
<li><span>Because I know your manifold crimes, and your grievous
sine: enemies of the just, taking bribes, and oppressing the poor
in the gate.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore the prudent shall keep silence at that time,
for it is an evil time.</span></li>
<li><span>Seek ye good, and not evil, that you may live: and the
Lord the God of hosts will be with you, as you have
said.</span></li>
<li><span>Hate evil, and love good, and establish judgment in the
gate: it may be the Lord the God of hosts may have mercy on the
remnant of Joseph.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord the God of hosts the
sovereign Lord: In every street there shall be wailing: and in all
places that are without, they shall say: Alas, alas! and they shall
call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful in
lamentation to lament.</span></li>
<li><span>And in all vineyards there shall be wailing: because I
will pass through in the midst of thee, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Woe to them that desire the day of the Lord: to what end
is it for you? the day of the Lord is darkness, and not
light.</span></li>
<li><span>As if a man should flee from the face of a lion, and a
bear should meet him: or enter into the house, and lean with his
hand upon the wall, and a serpent should bite him.</span></li>
<li><span>Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness, and not light:
and obscurity, and no brightness in it?</span></li>
<li><span>I hate, and have rejected your festivities: and I will
not receive the odour of your assemblies.</span></li>
<li><span>And if you offer me holocausts, and your gifts, I will
not receive them: neither will I regard the vows of your fat
beasts.</span></li>
<li><span>Take away from me the tumult of thy songs: and I will not
hear the canticles of thy harp.</span></li>
<li><span>But judgment shall be revealed as water, and justice as a
mighty torrent.</span></li>
<li><span>Did you offer victims and sacrifices to me in the desert
for forty years, O house of Israel?</span></li>
<li><span>But you carried a tabernacle for your Moloch, and the
image of your idols, the star of your god, which you made to
yourselves.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will cause you to go into captivity beyond
Damascus, saith the Lord, the God of hosts is his name.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="6">Amos 6</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Woe to you that are wealthy in Sion, and to you that have
confidence in the mountain of Samaria: ye great men, heads of the
people, that go in with state into the house of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Pass ye over to Chalane, and see, and go from thence into
Emath the great: and go down into Geth of the Philistines, and to
all the best kingdoms of these: if their border be larger than your
border.</span></li>
<li><span>You that are separated unto the evil day: and that
approach to the throne of iniquity;</span></li>
<li><span>You that sleep upon beds of ivory, and are wanton on your
couches: that eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of
the midst of the herd;</span></li>
<li><span>You that sing to the sound of the psaltery: they have
thought themselves to have instruments of music like
David;</span></li>
<li><span>That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the
best ointments: and they are not concerned for the affliction of
Joseph.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore now they shall go captive at the head of them
that go into captivity: and the faction of the luxurious ones shall
be taken away.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord God hath sworn by his own soul, saith the Lord
the God of hosts: I detest the pride of Jacob, and I hate his
houses, and I will deliver up the city with the inhabitants
thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>And if there remain ten men in one house, they also shall
die.</span></li>
<li><span>And a man's kinsman shall take him up, and shall burn
him, that he may carry the bones out of the house; and he shall say
to him that is in the inner rooms of the house: Is there yet any
with thee?</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall answer: There is an end. And he shall any to
him: Hold thy peace, and mention not the name of the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>For behold the Lord hath commanded, and he will strike
the greater house with breaches, and the lesser house with
clefts.</span></li>
<li><span>Can horses run upon the rocks, or can any one plough with
buffles? for you have turned judgment into bitterness, and the
fruit of justice into wormwood.</span></li>
<li><span>You that rejoice in a thing of nought: you that say: Have
we not taken unto us horns by our own strength?</span></li>
<li><span>But behold, I will raise up a nation against you, O house
of Israel, saith the Lord the God of hosts; and they shall destroy
you from the entrance of Emath, even to the torrent of the
desert.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="7">Amos 7</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>These things the Lord God shewed to me: and behold the
locust was formed in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter
rain, and lo, it was the latter rain after the king's
mowing.</span></li>
<li><span>And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of
eating the grass of the land, I said: O Lord God, be merciful, I
beseech thee: who shall raise up Jacob, for he is very
little?</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord had pity upon this: It shall not be, said the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>These things the Lord God shewed to me: and behold the
Lord called for judgment unto fire, and it devoured the great deep,
and ate up a part at the same time.</span></li>
<li><span>And I said: O Lord God, cease, I beseech thee, who shall
raise up Jacob, for he is a little one?</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord had pity upon this. Yea this also shall not be,
said the Lord God.</span></li>
<li><span>These things the Lord shewed to me: and behold the Lord
was standing upon a plastered wall, and in his hand a mason's
trowel.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to me: What seest thou, Amos? And I
said: A mason's trowel. And the Lord said: Behold, I will lay down
the trowel in the midst of my people Israel. I will plaster them
over no more.</span></li>
<li><span>And the high places of the idol shall be thrown down, and
the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste: and I will rise up
against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</span></li>
<li><span>And Amasias the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of
Israel, saying: Amos hath rebelled against thee in the midst of the
house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his
words.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith Amos: Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and
Israel shall be carried away captive out of their own
land.</span></li>
<li><span>And Amasias said to Amos: Thou seer, go, flee away into
the land of Juda: and eat bread there, and prophesy
there.</span></li>
<li><span>But prophesy not again any more in Bethel: because it is
the king's sanctuary, and it is the house of the
kingdom.</span></li>
<li><span>And Amos answered and said to Amasias: I am not a
prophet, nor am I the son of a prophet: but I am a herdsman
plucking wild figs.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord took me when I followed the flock, and the
Lord said to me: Go, prophesy to my people Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And now hear thou the word of the Lord: Thou sayest, thou
shalt not prophesy against Israel, and thou shalt not drop thy word
upon the house of the idol.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord: Thy wife shall play the
harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by
the sword, and thy land shall be measured by a line: and thou shalt
die in a polluted land, and Israel shall go into captivity out of
their land.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="8">Amos 8</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>These things the Lord shewed to me: and behold a hook to
draw down the fruit.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said: What seest thou, Amos? And I said: A hook to
draw down fruit. And the Lord said to me: The end is come upon my
people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more.</span></li>
<li><span>And the hinges of the temple shall screak in that day,
saith the Lord God: many shall die: silence shall be cast in every
place.</span></li>
<li><span>Hear this, you that crush the poor, and make the needy of
the land to fail,</span></li>
<li><span>Saying: When will the month be over, and we shall sell
our wares: and the sabbath, and we shall open the corn: that we may
lessen the measure, and increase the sicle, and may convey in
deceitful balances,</span></li>
<li><span>That we may possess the needy for money, and the poor for
a pair of shoes, and may sell the refuse of the corn?</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord hath sworn against the pride of Jacob: surely I
will never forget all their works.</span></li>
<li><span>Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn
that dwelleth therein: and rise up altogether as a river, and be
cast out, and run down as the river of Egypt?</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord
God, that the sun shall go down at midday, and I will make the
earth dark in the day of light:</span></li>
<li><span>And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your
songs into lamentation: and I will bring up sackcloth upon every
back of yours, and baldness upon every head: and I will make it as
the mourning of an only son, and the latter end thereof as a bitter
day.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold the days come, saith the Lord, and I will send
forth a famine into the land: not a famine of bread, nor a thirst
of water, but of hearing the word of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall move from sea to sea, and from the north
to the east: they shall go about seeking the word of the Lord, and
shall not find it.</span></li>
<li><span>In that day the fair virgins, and the young men shall
faint for thirst.</span></li>
<li><span>They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say: Thy God,
O Dan, liveth: and the way of Bersabee liveth: and they shall fall,
and shall rise no more.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="9">Amos 9</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>I saw the Lord standing upon the altar, and he said:
Strike the hinges, and let the lintels be shook: for there is
covetousness in the head of them all, and I will slay the last of
them with the sword: there shall be no flight for them: they shall
flee, and he that shall flee of them shall not be
delivered.</span></li>
<li><span>Though they go down even to hell, thence shall my hand
bring them out: and though they climb up to heaven, thence will I
bring them down.</span></li>
<li><span>And though they be hid in the top of Carmel, I will
search and take them away from thence : and though they hide
themselves from my eyes in the depth of the sea, there will I
command the serpent and he shall bite them.</span></li>
<li><span>And if they go into captivity before their enemies, there
will I command the sword, and it shall kill them. And I will set my
eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord the God of hosts is he who toucheth the
earth, and it shall melt: and all that dwell therein shall mourn:
and it shall rise up as a river, and shall run down as the river of
Egypt.</span></li>
<li><span>He that buildeth his ascension in heaven, and hath
founded his bundle upon the earth: who calleth the waters of the
sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth, the Lord is
his name.</span></li>
<li><span>Are not you as the children of the Ethiopians unto me, O
children of Israel, saith the Lord? did not I bring up Israel, out
of the land of Egypt: and the Philistines out of Cappadocia, and
the Syrians out of Cyrene?</span></li>
<li><span>Behold the eyes of the Lord God are upon the sinful
kingdom, and I will destroy it from the face of the earth: but yet
I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>For behold I will command, and I will sift the house of
Israel among all nations, as corn is sifted in a sieve: and there
shall not a little stone fall to the ground.</span></li>
<li><span>All the sinners of my people shall fall by the sword: who
say: The evils shall not approach, and shall not come upon
us.</span></li>
<li><span>In that day I will raise up the tabernacle of David, that
is fallen: and I will close up the breaches of the walls thereof,
and repair what was fallen: and I will rebuild it as in the days of
old.</span></li>
<li><span>That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all
nations, because my name is invoked upon them: saith the Lord that
doth these things.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold the days come, saith the Lord, when the ploughman
shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that
soweth seed: and the mountains shall drop sweetness, and every hill
shall be tilled.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will bring back the captivity of my people Israel:
and they shall build the abandoned cities, and inhabit them: and
they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine of them: and shall
make gardens, and eat the fruits of them. And I will plant them
upon their own land: and I will no more pluck them out of their
land which I have given them, saith the Lord thy God.</span></li>
