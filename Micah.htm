<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="1">Micah 1</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>The word of the Lord that came to Micah the Morasthite,
in the days of Joathan, Achaz, and Ezechias, kings of Juda: which
he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>Hear, all ye people: and let the earth give ear, and all
that is therein: and let the Lord God be a witness to you, the Lord
from his holy temple.</span></li>
<li><span>For behold the Lord will come forth out of his place: and
he will come down, and will tread upon the high places of the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And the mountains shall be melted under him: and the
valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as waters that
run down a steep place.</span></li>
<li><span>For the wickedness of Jacob is all this, and for the sins
of the house of Israel. What is the wickedness of Jacob? is it not
Samaria? and what are the high places of Juda? are they not
Jerusalem ?</span></li>
<li><span>And I will make Samaria as a heap of stones in the field
when a vineyard is planted: and I will bring down the stones
thereof into the valley, and will lay her foundations
bare.</span></li>
<li><span>And all her graven things shall be cut in pieces, and all
her wages shall be burnt with fire, and I will bring to destruction
all her idols: for they were gathered together of the hire of a
harlot, and unto the hire of a harlot they shall
return.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore will I lament and howl: I will go stripped and
naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and a mourning like
the ostriches.</span></li>
<li><span>Because her wound is desperate, because it is come even
to Juda, it hath touched the gate of my people even to
Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>Declare ye it not in Geth, weep ya not with tears: in the
house of Dust sprinkle yourselves with dust.</span></li>
<li><span>And pass away, O thou that dwellest in the Beautiful
place, covered with thy shame: she went not forth that dwelleth in
the confines: the House adjoining shall receive mourning from you,
which stood by herself.</span></li>
<li><span>For she is become weak unto good that dwelleth in
bitterness: for evil is come down from the Lord into the gate of
Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>A tumult of chariots hath astonished the inhabitants of
Lachis: it is the beginning of sin to the daughter of Sion, for in
thee were found the crimes of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore shall she send messengers to the inheritance of
Geth : the houses of lying to deceive the kings of
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Yet will I bring an heir to thee that dwellest in Maresa:
even to Odollam shall the glory of Israel come.</span></li>
<li><span>Make thee bald, and be polled for thy delicate children:
enlarge thy baldness as the eagle: for they are carried into
captivity from thee.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="2">Micah 2</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Woe to you that devise that which is unprofitable, and
work evil in your beds: in the morning light they execute it,
because their hand is against God.</span></li>
<li><span>And they have coveted fields, and taken them by violence,
and houses they have forcibly taken away: and oppressed a man and
his house, a man and his inheritance.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord : Behold, I devise an evil
against this family: from which you shall not withdraw your necks,
and you shall not walk haughtily, for this is a very evil
time.</span></li>
<li><span>In that day a parable shall be taken up upon you, and a
song shall be sung with melody by them that say: We are laid waste
and spoiled: the portion of my people is changed: how shall he
depart from me, whereas he is returning that will divide our
land?</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the cord
of a lot in the assembly of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Speak ye not, saying: It shall not drop upon these,
confusion shall not take them.</span></li>
<li><span>The house of Jacob saith: Is the spirit of the Lord
straitened, or are these his thoughts? Are not my words good to him
that walketh uprightly?</span></li>
<li><span>But my people, on the contrary, are risen up as an enemy:
you have taken away the cloak off from the coat: and them that
passed harmless you have turned to war.</span></li>
<li><span>You have cast out the women of my people from their
houses, in which they took delight: you have taken my praise for
ever from their children.</span></li>
<li><span>Arise ye, and depart, for there is no rest here for you.
For that uncleanness of the land, it shall be corrupted with a
grievous corruption.</span></li>
<li><span>Would God I were not a man that hath the spirit, and that
I rather spoke a lie: I will let drop to thee of wine, and of
drunkenness: and it shall be this people upon whom it shall
drop.</span></li>
<li><span>I will assemble and gather together all of thee, O Jacob:
I will bring together the remnant of Israel, I will put them
together as a flock in the fold, as the sheep in the midst of the
sheepcotes, they shall make a tumult by reason of the multitude of
men.</span></li>
<li><span>For he shall go up that shall open the way before them:
they shall divide, and pass through the gate, and shall come in by
it: and their king shall pass before them, and the Lord at the head
of them.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="3">Micah 3</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And I said: Hear, O ye princes of Jacob, and ye chiefs of
the house of Israel: Is it not your part to know
judgment,</span></li>
<li><span>You that hate good, and love evil: that violently pluck
off their skins from them, and their flesh from their
bones?</span></li>
<li><span>Who have eaten the flesh of my people, and have flayed
their skin from off them: and have broken, and chopped their bones
as for the kettle, and as flesh in the midst of the
pot.</span></li>
<li><span>Then shall they cry to the Lord, and he will not hear
them: and he will hide his face from them at that time, as they
have behaved wickedly in their devices.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that make my
people err: that bite with their teeth, and preach peace: and if a
man give not something into their mouth, they prepare war against
him.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore night shall be to you instead of vision, and
darkness to you instead of divination; and the sun shall go down
upon the prophets, and the day shall be darkened over
them.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall be confounded that see visions, and the
diviners shall be confounded: and they shall all cover their faces,
because there is no answer of God.</span></li>
<li><span>But yet I am filled with the strength of the spirit of
the Lord, with judgment, and power: to declare unto Jacob his
wickedness, and to Israel his sin.</span></li>
<li><span>Hear this, ye princes of the house of Jacob, and ye
judges of the house of Israel: you that abhor judgment, and pervert
all that is right.</span></li>
<li><span>You that build up Sion with blood, and Jerusalem with
iniquity.</span></li>
<li><span>Her princes have judged for bribes, and her priests have
taught for hire, and her prophets divined for money: and they
leaned upon the Lord, saying: Is not the Lord in the midst of us?
no evil shall come upon us.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore, because of you, Sion shall be ploughed as a
field, and Jerusalem shall be as a heap of stones, and the mountain
of the temple as the high places of the forests.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="4">Micah 4</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the
mountain of the house of the Lord shall be prepared in the top of
mountains, and high above the hills: and people shall flow to
it.</span></li>
<li><span>And many nations shall come in haste, and say: Come, let
us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God
of Jacob: and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his
paths: for the law shall go forth out of Sion, and the word of the
Lord out of Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong
nations afar off: and they shall beat their swords into
ploughshares, and their spears into spades: nation shall not take
sword against nation: neither shall they learn war any
more.</span></li>
<li><span>And every man shall sit under his vine, and under his fig
tree, and there shall be none to make them afraid: for the mouth of
the Lord of hosts hath spoken.</span></li>
<li><span>For all people will walk every one in the name of his
god: but we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and
ever.</span></li>
<li><span>In that day, saith the Lord, I will gather up her that
halteth: and her that I had cast out, I will gather up: and her
whom I had afflicted.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will make her that halted, a remnant: and her that
hath been afflicted, a mighty nation: and the Lord will reign over
them in mount Sion, from this time now and for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou, O cloudy tower of the flock, of the daughter of
Sion, unto thee shall it come: yea the first power shall come, the
kingdom to the daughter of Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>Now, why art thou drawn together with grief? Hast thou no
king in thee, or is thy counsellor perished, because sorrow hath
taken thee as a woman in labour?</span></li>
<li><span>Be in pain and labour, O daughter of Sion, as a woman
that bringeth forth: for now shalt thou go out of the city, and
shalt dwell in the country, and shalt come even to Babylon, there
thou shalt be delivered: there the Lord will redeem thee out of the
hand of thy enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>And now many nations are gathered together against thee,
and they say: Let her be stoned: and let our eye look upon
Sion.</span></li>
<li><span>But they have not known the thoughts of the Lord, and
have not understood his counsel: because he hath gathered them
together as the hay of the floor.</span></li>
<li><span>Arise, and tread, O daughter of Sion: for I will make thy
horn iron, and thy hoofs I will make brass: and thou shalt beat in
pieces many peoples, and shalt immolate the spoils of them to the
Lord, and their strength to the Lord of the whole
earth.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="5">Micah 5</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Now shalt thou be laid waste, O daughter of the robber:
they have laid siege against us, with a rod shall they strike the
cheek of the judge of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>AND THOU, BETHLEHEM Ephrata, art a little one among the
thousands of Juda: out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is
to be the ruler in Israel: and his going forth is from the
beginning, from the days of eternity.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore will he give them up even till the time wherein
she that travaileth shall bring forth: and the remnant of his
brethren shall be converted to the children of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall stand, and feed in the strength of the Lord,
in the height of the name of the Lord his God: and they shall be
converted, for now shall he be magnified even to the ends of the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And this man shall be our peace, when the Assyrian shall
come into our land, and when he shall set his foot in our houses:
and we shall raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal
men.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall feed the land of Assyria with the sword,
and the land of Nemrod with the spears thereof: and he shall
deliver us from the Assyrian, when he shall come into our land, and
when he shall tread in our borders.</span></li>
<li><span>And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many
peoples as a dew from the Lord, and as drops upon the grass, which
waiteth not for man, nor tarrieth for the children of
men.</span></li>
<li><span>And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in
the midst of many peoples as a lion among the beasts of the
forests, and as a young lion among the docks of sheep: who when he
shall go through and tread down, and take, there is none to
deliver.</span></li>
<li><span>Thy hand shall be lifted up over thy enemies, and all thy
enemies shall be cut off.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord,
that I will take away thy horses out of the midst of thee, and will
destroy thy chariots.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will destroy the cities of thy land, and will throw
down all thy strong holds, and I will take away sorceries out of
thy hand, and there shall be no divinations in thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will destroy thy graven things, and thy statues out
of the midst of thee: and thou shalt no more adore the works of thy
hands.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee:
and will crush thy cities.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will execute vengeance in wrath and in indignation
among all the nations that have not given ear.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="6">Micah 6</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Hear ye what the Lord saith: Arise, contend thou in
judgment against the mountains, and let the hills hear thy
voice.</span></li>
<li><span>Let the mountains hear the judgment of the Lord, and the
strong foundations of the earth: for the Lord will enter into
judgment with his people, and he will plead against
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>O my people, what have I done to thee, or in what have I
molested thee? answer thou me.</span></li>
<li><span>For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and
delivered thee out of the house of slaves: and I sent before thy
face Moses, and Aaron, and Mary.</span></li>
<li><span>O my people, remember, I pray thee, what Balach the king
of Moab purposed: and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him,
from Setim to Galgal, that thou mightest know the justices of the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>What shall I offer to the Lord that is worthy? wherewith
shall I kneel before the high God? shall I offer holocausts unto
him, and calves of a year old?</span></li>
<li><span>May the Lord be appeased with thousands of rams, or with
many thousands of fat he goats? shall I give my firstborn for my
wickedness, the fruit of my body for the sin of my
soul?</span></li>
<li><span>I will shew thee, O man, what is good, and what the Lord
requireth of thee: Verily, to do judgment, and to love mercy, and
to walk solicitous with thy God.</span></li>
<li><span>The voice of the Lord crieth to the city, and salvation
shall be to them that fear thy name: hear, O ye tribes, and who
shall approve it?</span></li>
<li><span>As yet there is a fire in the house of the wicked, the
treasures of iniquity, and a scant measure full of
wrath.</span></li>
<li><span>Shall I justify wicked balances, and the deceitful
weights of the bag?</span></li>
<li><span>By which her rich men were filled with iniquity, and the
inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue was
deceitful in their mouth.</span></li>
<li><span>And I therefore began to strike thee with desolation for
thy sins.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt eat, but shalt not be filled: and thy
humiliation shall be in the midst of thee: and thou shalt take
hold, but shalt not save: and those whom thou shalt save, I will
give up to the sword.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt sow, but shalt not reap: thou shalt tread the
olives, but shalt not be anointed with the oil: and the new wine,
but shalt not drink the wine.</span></li>
<li><span>For thou hast kept the statutes of Amri, and all the
works of the house of Achab: and thou hast walked according to
their wills, that I should make thee a desolation, and the
inhabitants thereof a hissing, and you shall bear the reproach of
my people.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="7">Micah 7</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Woe is me, for I am become as one that gleaneth in autumn
the grapes of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat, my soul
desired the firstripe figs.</span></li>
<li><span>The holy man is perished out of the earth, and there is
none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood, every one
hunteth his brother to death.</span></li>
<li><span>The evil of their hands they call good: the prince
requireth, and the judge is for giving: and the great man hath
uttered the desire of his soul, and they have troubled
it.</span></li>
<li><span>He that is best among them, is as a brier: and he that is
righteous, as the thorn of the hedge. The day of thy inspection,
thy visitation cometh: now shall be their destruction.</span></li>
<li><span>Believe not a friend, and trust not in a prince: keep the
doors of thy mouth from her that sleepeth in thy bosom.</span></li>
<li><span>For the son dishonoureth the father, and the daughter
riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her
mother in law: and a man's enemies are they of his own
household.</span></li>
<li><span>But I will look towards the Lord, I will wait for God my
Saviour: my God will hear me.</span></li>
<li><span>Rejoice not, thou, my enemy, over me, because I am
fallen: I shall arise, when I sit in darkness, the Lord is my
light.</span></li>
<li><span>I will bear the wrath of the Lord, because I have sinned
against him; until he judge my cause and execute judgment for me:
he will bring me forth into the light, I shall behold his
justice.</span></li>
<li><span>And my enemy shall behold, and she shall be covered with
shame, who saith to me: Where is the Lord thy God? My eyes shall
look down upon her: now shall she be trodden under foot as the mire
of the streets.</span></li>
<li><span>The day shall come, that thy walls may be built up: in
that day shall the law be far removed.</span></li>
<li><span>In that day they shall come even from Assyria to thee,
and to the fortified cities: and from the fortified cities even to
the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to
mountain.</span></li>
<li><span>And the land shall be made desolate, because of the
inhabitants thereof, and for the fruit of their
devices.</span></li>
<li><span>Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thy
inheritance, them that dwell alone in the forest, in the midst of
Carmel: they shall feed in Basan and Galaad according to the days
of old.</span></li>
<li><span>According to the days of thy coming out of the land of
Egypt I will shew him wonders.</span></li>
<li><span>The nations shall see, and shall be confounded at all
their strength: they shall put the hand upon the mouth, their ears
shall be deaf.</span></li>
<li><span>They shall lick the dust like serpents, as the creeping
things of the earth, they shall be disturbed in their houses: they
shall dread the Lord our God, and shall fear thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Who is a God like to thee, who takest away iniquity, and
passest by the sin of the remnant of thy inheritance? he will send
his fury in no more, because he delighteth in mercy.</span></li>
<li><span>He will turn again, and have mercy on us: he will put
away our iniquities: and he will cast all our sins into the bottom
of the sea.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou wilt perform the truth of Jacob, the mercy to
Abraham: which thou hast sworn to our fathers from the days of
old.</span></li>
