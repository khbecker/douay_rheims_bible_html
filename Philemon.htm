And do thou receive him as my own bowels.<li>Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered to me in the bands of the gospel:<li>But without thy counsel I would do nothing: that thy good deed might not be as it were of necessity, but voluntary.<li>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season from thee, that thou mightest receive him again for ever:<li>Not now as a servant, but instead of a servant, a most dear brother, especially to me: but how much more to thee both in the flesh and in the Lord?<li>If therefore thou count me a partner, receive him as myself.<li>And if he hath wronged thee in any thing, or is in thy debt, put that to my account.<li>I Paul have written it with my own hand: I will repay it: not to say to thee, that thou owest me thy own self also.<li>Yea, brother. May I enjoy thee in the Lord. Refresh my bowels in the Lord.<li>Trusting in thy obedience, I have written to thee: knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.<li>But withal prepare me also a lodging. For I hope that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.<li>There salute thee Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus;<li>Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke my fellow labourers.<li>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</ol></body></html>
