<li><span>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy, a brother:
to Philemon, our beloved and fellow labourer;</span></li>
<li><span>And to Appia, our dearest sister, and to Archippus, our
fellow soldier, and to the church which is in thy
house:</span></li>
<li><span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and from the
Lord Jesus Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>I give thanks to my God, always making a remembrance of
thee in my prayers.</span></li>
<li><span>Hearing of thy charity and faith, which thou hast in the
Lord Jesus, and towards all the saints:</span></li>
<li><span>That the communication of thy faith may be made evident
in the acknowledgment of every good work, that is in you in Christ
Jesus.</span></li>
<li><span>For I have had great joy and consolation in thy charity,
because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed by thee,
brother.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore though I have much confidence in Christ Jesus,
to command thee that which is to the purpose:</span></li>
<li><span>For charity sake I rather beseech, whereas thou art such
a one, as Paul an old man, and now a prisoner also of Jesus
Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>I beseech thee for my son, whom I have begotten in my
bands, Onesimus,</span></li>
<li><span>Who hath been heretofore unprofitable to thee, but now is
profitable both to me and thee,</span></li>
<li><span>Whom I have sent back to thee. And do thou receive him as
my own bowels.</span></li>
<li><span>Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he
might have ministered to me in the bands of the gospel:</span></li>
<li><span>But without thy counsel I would do nothing: that thy good
deed might not be as it were of necessity, but
voluntary.</span></li>
<li><span>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season from thee,
that thou mightest receive him again for ever:</span></li>
<li><span>Not now as a servant, but instead of a servant, a most
dear brother, especially to me: but how much more to thee both in
the flesh and in the Lord?</span></li>
<li><span>If therefore thou count me a partner, receive him as
myself.</span></li>
<li><span>And if he hath wronged thee in any thing, or is in thy
debt, put that to my account.</span></li>
<li><span>I Paul have written it with my own hand: I will repay it:
not to say to thee, that thou owest me thy own self
also.</span></li>
<li><span>Yea, brother. May I enjoy thee in the Lord. Refresh my
bowels in the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Trusting in thy obedience, I have written to thee:
knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</span></li>
<li><span>But withal prepare me also a lodging. For I hope that
through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</span></li>
<li><span>There salute thee Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ
Jesus;</span></li>
<li><span>Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke my fellow
labourers.</span></li>
<li><span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
Amen.</span></li>
