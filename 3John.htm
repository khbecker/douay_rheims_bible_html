  <ol>
    <li><span>The ancient to the dearly beloved Gaius, whom I love
    in truth.</span></li>

    <li><span>Dearly beloved, concerning all things I make it my
    prayer that thou mayest proceed prosperously, and fare well as
    thy soul doth prosperously.</span></li>

    <li><span>I was exceedingly glad when the brethren came and
    gave testimony to the truth in thee, even as thou walkest in
    the truth.</span></li>

    <li><span>I have no greater grace than this, to hear that my
    children walk in truth.</span></li>

    <li><span>Dearly beloved, thou dost faithfully whatever thou
    dost for the brethren, and that for strangers,</span></li>

    <li><span>Who have given testimony to thy charity in the sight
    of the church: whom thou shalt do well to bring forward on
    their way in a manner worthy of God.</span></li>

    <li><span>Because, for his name they went out, taking nothing
    of the Gentiles.</span></li>

    <li><span>We therefore ought to receive such, that we may be
    fellow helpers of the truth.</span></li>

    <li><span>I had written perhaps to the church: but Diotrephes,
    who loveth to have the pre-eminence among them, doth not
    receive us.</span></li>

    <li><span>For this cause, if I come, I will advertise his works
    which he doth, with malicious words prating against us. And as
    if these things were not enough for him, neither doth he
    himself receive the brethren, and them that do receive them he
    forbiddeth, and casteth out of the church.</span></li>

    <li><span>Dearly beloved, follow not that which is evil, but
    that which is good. He that doth good, is of God: he that doth
    evil, hath not seen God.</span></li>

    <li><span>To Demetrius testimony is given by all, and by the
    truth itself, yea and we also give testimony: and thou knowest
    that our testimony is true.</span></li>

    <li><span>I had many things to write unto thee: but I would not
    by ink and pen write to thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>But I hope speedily to see thee, and we will speak
    mouth to mouth. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee.
    Salute the friends by name.</span></li>
