  <ol>
    <li><span>That which was from the beginning, which we have
    heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked
    upon, and our hands have handled, of the word of
    life:</span></li>

    <li><span>For the life was manifested; and we have seen and do
    bear witness, and declare unto you the life eternal, which was
    with the Father, and hath appeared to us:</span></li>

    <li><span>That which we have seen and have heard, we declare
    unto you, that you also may have fellowship with us, and our
    fellowship may be with the Father, and with his Son Jesus
    Christ.</span></li>

    <li><span>And these things we write to you, that you may
    rejoice, and your joy may be full.</span></li>

    <li><span>And this is the declaration which we have heard from
    him, and declare unto you: That God is light, and in him there
    is no darkness.</span></li>

    <li><span>If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk
    in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth.</span></li>

    <li><span>But if we walk in the light, as he also is in the
    light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of
    Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.</span></li>

    <li><span>If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,
    and the truth is not in us.</span></li>

    <li><span>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just, to
    forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
    iniquity.</span></li>

    <li><span>If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a
    liar, and his word is not in us.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="2">1 John 2</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>My little children, these things I write to you, that
    you may not sin. But if any man sin, we have an advocate with
    the Father, Jesus Christ the just:</span></li>

    <li><span>And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for
    ours only, but also for those of the whole world.</span></li>

    <li><span>And by this we know that we have known him, if we
    keep his commandments.</span></li>

    <li><span>He who saith that he knoweth him, and keepeth not his
    commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he that keepeth his word, in him in very deed the
    charity of God is perfected; and by this we know that we are in
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>He that saith he abideth in him, ought himself also
    to walk, even as he walked.</span></li>

    <li><span>Dearly beloved, I write not a new commandment to you,
    but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The
    old commandment is the word which you have heard.</span></li>

    <li><span>Again a new commandment I write unto you, which thing
    is true both in him and in you; because the darkness is passed,
    and the true light now shineth.</span></li>

    <li><span>He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his
    brother, is in darkness even until now.</span></li>

    <li><span>He that loveth his brother, abideth in the light, and
    there is no scandal in him.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he that hateth his brother, is in darkness, and
    walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth; because
    the darkness hath blinded his eyes.</span></li>

    <li><span>I write unto you, little children, because your sins
    are forgiven you for his name's sake.</span></li>

    <li><span>I write unto you, fathers, because you have known
    him, who is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men,
    because you have overcome the wicked one.</span></li>

    <li><span>I write unto you, babes, because you have known the
    Father. I write unto you, young men, because you are strong,
    and the word of God abideth in you, and you have overcome the
    wicked one.</span></li>

    <li><span>Love not the world, nor the things which are in the
    world. If any man love the world, the charity of the Father is
    not in him.</span></li>

    <li><span>For all that is in the world, is the concupiscence of
    the flesh, and the concupiscence of the eyes, and the pride of
    life, which is not of the Father, but is of the
    world.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the world passeth away, and the concupiscence
    thereof: but he that doth the will of God, abideth for
    ever.</span></li>

    <li><span>Little children, it is the last hour; and as you have
    heard that Antichrist cometh, even now there are become many
    Antichrists: whereby we know that it is the last
    hour.</span></li>

    <li><span>They went out from us, but they were not of us. For
    if they had been of us, they would no doubt have remained with
    us; but that they may be manifest, that they are not all of
    us.</span></li>

    <li><span>But you have the unction from the Holy One, and know
    all things.</span></li>

    <li><span>I have not written to you as to them that know not
    the truth, but as to them that know it: and that no lie is of
    the truth.</span></li>

    <li><span>Who is a liar, but he who denieth that Jesus is the
    Christ? This is Antichrist, who denieth the Father, and the
    Son.</span></li>

    <li><span>Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the
    Father. He that confesseth the Son, hath the Father
    also.</span></li>

    <li><span>As for you, let that which you have heard from the
    beginning, abide in you. If that abide in you, which you have
    heard from the beginning, you also shall abide in the Son, and
    in the Father.</span></li>

    <li><span>And this is the promise which he hath promised us,
    life everlasting.</span></li>

    <li><span>These things have I written to you, concerning them
    that seduce you.</span></li>

    <li><span>And as for you, let the unction, which you have
    received from him, abide in you. And you have no need that any
    man teach you; but as his unction teacheth you of all things,
    and is truth, and is no lie. And as it hath taught you, abide
    in him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And now, little children, abide in him, that when he
    shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be confounded by
    him at his coming.</span></li>

    <li><span>If you know, that he is just, know ye, that every one
    also, who doth justice, is born of him.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="3">1 John 3</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Behold what manner of charity the Father hath
    bestowed upon us, that we should be called, and should be the
    sons of God. Therefore the world knoweth not us, because it
    knew not him.</span></li>

    <li><span>Dearly beloved, we are now the sons of God; and it
    hath not yet appeared what we shall be. We know, that, when he
    shall appear, we shall be like to him: because we shall see him
    as he is.</span></li>

    <li><span>And every one that hath this hope in him, sanctifieth
    himself, as he also is holy.</span></li>

    <li><span>Whosoever committeth sin commmitteth also iniquity;
    and sin is iniquity.</span></li>

    <li><span>And you know that he appeared to take away our sins,
    and in him there is no sin.</span></li>

    <li><span>Whosoever abideth in him, sinneth not; and whosoever
    sinneth, hath not seen him, nor known him.</span></li>

    <li><span>Little children, let no man deceive you. He that doth
    justice is just, even as he is just.</span></li>

    <li><span>He that commmitteth sin is of the devil: for the
    devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose, the Son of
    God appeared, that he might destroy the works of the
    devil.</span></li>

    <li><span>Whosoever is born of God, commmitteth not sin: for
    his seed abideth in him, and he can not sin, because he is born
    of God.</span></li>

    <li><span>In this the children of God are manifest, and the
    children of the devil. Whosoever is not just, is not of God,
    nor he that loveth not his brother.</span></li>

    <li><span>For this is the declaration, which you have heard
    from the beginning, that you should love one
    another.</span></li>

    <li><span>Not as Cain, who was of the wicked one, and killed
    his brother. And wherefore did he kill him? Because his own
    works were wicked: and his brother's just.</span></li>

    <li><span>Wonder not, brethren, if the world hate
    you.</span></li>

    <li><span>We know that we have passed from death to life,
    because we love the brethren. He that loveth not, abideth in
    death.</span></li>

    <li><span>Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer. And you
    know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in
    himself.</span></li>

    <li><span>In this we have known the charity of God, because he
    hath laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our
    lives for the brethren.</span></li>

    <li><span>He that hath the substance of this world, and shall
    see his brother in need, and shall shut up his bowels from him:
    how doth the charity of God abide in him?</span></li>

    <li><span>My little children, let us not love in word, nor in
    tongue, but in deed, and in truth.</span></li>

    <li><span>In this we know that we are of the truth: and in his
    sight shall persuade our hearts.</span></li>

    <li><span>For if our heart reprehend us, God is greater than
    our heart, and knoweth all things.</span></li>

    <li><span>Dearly beloved, if our heart do not reprehend us, we
    have confidence towards God:</span></li>

    <li><span>And whatsoever we shall ask, we shall receive of him:
    because we keep his commandments, and do those things which are
    pleasing in his sight.</span></li>

    <li><span>And this is his commandment, that we should believe
    in the name of his Son Jesus Christ: and love one another, as
    he hath given commandment unto us.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he that keepeth his commandments, abideth in him,
    and he in him. And in this we know that he abideth in us, by
    the Spirit which he hath given us.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="4">1 John 4</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Dearly beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the
    spirits if they be of God: because many false prophets are gone
    out into the world.</span></li>

    <li><span>By this is the spirit of God known. Every spirit
    which confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of
    God:</span></li>

    <li><span>And every spirit that dissolveth Jesus, is not of
    God: and this is Antichrist, of whom you have heard that he
    cometh, and he is now already in the world.</span></li>

    <li><span>You are of God, little children, and have overcome
    him. Because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in
    the world.</span></li>

    <li><span>They are of the world: therefore of the world they
    speak, and the world heareth them.</span></li>

    <li><span>We are of God. He that knoweth God, heareth us. He
    that is not of God, heareth us not. By this we know the spirit
    of truth, and the spirit of error.</span></li>

    <li><span>Dearly beloved, let us love one another, for charity
    is of God. And every one that loveth, is born of God, and
    knoweth God.</span></li>

    <li><span>He that loveth not, knoweth not God: for God is
    charity.</span></li>

    <li><span>By this hath the charity of God appeared towards us,
    because God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world,
    that we may live by him.</span></li>

    <li><span>In this is charity: not as though we had loved God,
    but because he hath first loved us, and sent his Son to be a
    propitiation for our sins.</span></li>

    <li><span>My dearest, if God hath so loved us; we also ought to
    love one another.</span></li>

    <li><span>No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one
    another, God abideth in us, and his charity is perfected in
    us.</span></li>

    <li><span>In this we know that we abide in him, and he in us:
    because he hath given us of his spirit.</span></li>

    <li><span>And we have seen, and do testify, that the Father
    hath sent his Son to be the Saviour of the world.</span></li>

    <li><span>Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God,
    God abideth in him, and he in God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And we have known, and have believed the charity,
    which God hath to us. God is charity: and he that abideth in
    charity, abideth in God, and God in him.</span></li>

    <li><span>In this is the charity of God perfected with us, that
    we may have confidence in the day of judgment: because as he
    is, we also are in this world.</span></li>

    <li><span>Fear is not in charity: but perfect charity casteth
    out fear, because fear hath pain. And he that feareth, is not
    perfected in charity.</span></li>

    <li><span>Let us therefore love God, because God first hath
    loved us.</span></li>

    <li><span>If any man say, I love God, and hateth his brother;
    he is a liar. For he that loveth not his brother, whom he
    seeth, how can he love God, whom he seeth not?</span></li>

    <li><span>And this commandment we have from God, that he, who
    loveth God, love also his brother.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="5">1 John 5</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born
    of God. And every one that loveth him who begot, loveth him
    also who is born of him.</span></li>

    <li><span>In this we know that we love the children of God:
    when we love God, and keep his commandments.</span></li>

    <li><span>For this is the charity of God, that we keep his
    commandments: and his commandments are not heavy.</span></li>

    <li><span>For whatsoever is born of God, overcometh the world:
    and this is the victory which overcometh the world, our
    faith.</span></li>

    <li><span>Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that
    believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?</span></li>

    <li><span>This is he that came by water and blood, Jesus
    Christ: not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is
    the Spirit which testifieth, that Christ is the
    truth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And there are three who give testimony in heaven, the
    Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost. And these three are
    one.</span></li>

    <li><span>And there are three that give testimony on earth: the
    spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three are
    one.</span></li>

    <li><span>If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of
    God is greater. For this is the testimony of God, which is
    greater, because he hath testified of his Son.</span></li>

    <li><span>He that believeth in the Son of God, hath the
    testimony of God in himself. He that believeth not the Son,
    maketh him a liar: because he believeth not in the testimony
    which God hath testified of his Son.</span></li>

    <li><span>And this is the testimony, that God hath given to us
    eternal life. And this life is in his Son.</span></li>

    <li><span>He that hath the Son, hath life. He that hath not the
    Son, hath not life.</span></li>

    <li><span>These things I write to you, that you may know that
    you have eternal life, you who believe in the name of the Son
    of God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And this is the confidence which we have towards him:
    That, whatsoever we shall ask according to his will, he heareth
    us.</span></li>

    <li><span>And we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask: we
    know that we have the petitions which we request of
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>He that knoweth his brother to sin a sin which is not
    to death, let him ask, and life shall be given to him, who
    sinneth not to death. There is a sin unto death: for that I say
    not that any man ask.</span></li>

    <li><span>All iniquity is sin. And there is a sin unto
    death.</span></li>

    <li><span>We know that whosoever is born of God, sinneth not:
    but the generation of God preserveth him, and the wicked one
    toucheth him not.</span></li>

    <li><span>We know that we are of God, and the whole world is
    seated in wickedness.</span></li>

    <li><span>And we know that the Son of God is come: and he hath
    given us understanding that we may know the true God, and may
    be in his true Son. This is the true God and life
    eternal.</span></li>

    <li><span>Little children, keep yourselves from idols.
    Amen.</span></li>
