<li><span>The ancient to the lady Elect, and her children, whom I
love in the truth, and not I only, but also all they that have
known the truth,</span></li>
<li><span>For the sake of the truth which dwelleth in us, and shall
be with us for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>Grace be with you, mercy, and peace from God the Father,
and from Christ Jesus the Son of the Father; in truth and
charity.</span></li>
<li><span>I was exceeding glad, that I found of thy children
walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the
Father.</span></li>
<li><span>And now I beseech thee, lady, not as writing a new
commandment to thee, but that which we have had from the beginning,
that we love one another.</span></li>
<li><span>And this is charity, that we walk according to his
commandments. For this is the commandment, that, as you have heard
from the beginning, you should walk in the same:</span></li>
<li><span>For many seducers are gone out into the world, who
confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh: this is a
seducer and an antichrist.</span></li>
<li><span>Look to yourselves, that you lose not the things which
you have wrought: but that you may receive a full
reward.</span></li>
<li><span>Whosoever revolteth, and continueth not in the doctrine
of Christ, hath not God. He that continueth in the doctrine, the
same hath both the Father and the Son.</span></li>
<li><span>If any man come to you, and bring not this doctrine,
receive him not into the house nor say to him, God speed
you.</span></li>
<li><span>For he that saith unto him, God speed you, communicateth
with his wicked works.</span></li>
<li><span>Having more things to write unto you, I would not by
paper and ink: for I hope that I shall be with you, and speak face
to face: that your joy may be full.</span></li>
<li><span>The children of thy sister Elect salute thee.</span></li>
