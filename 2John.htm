For this is the commandment, that, as you have heard from the beginning, you should walk in the same:<li>For many seducers are gone out into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh: this is a seducer and an antichrist.<li>Look to yourselves, that you lose not the things which you have wrought: but that you may receive a full reward.<li>Whosoever revolteth, and continueth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that continueth in the doctrine, the same hath both the Father and the Son.<li>If any man come to you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into the house nor say to him, God speed you.<li>For he that saith unto him, God speed you, communicateth with his wicked works.<li>Having more things to write unto you, I would not by paper and ink: for I hope that I shall be with you, and speak face to face: that your joy may be full.<li>The children of thy sister Elect salute thee.</ol></body></html>
