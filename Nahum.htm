<ol>
<li><span>The burden of Ninive. The book of the vision of Nahum the
Elcesite.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord is a jealous God, and a revenger: the Lord is a
revenger, and hath wrath: the Lord taketh vengeance on his
adversaries, and he is angry with his enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord is patient, and great in power, and will not
cleanse and acquit the guilty. The Lord's ways are in a tempest,
and a whirlwind, and clouds are the dust of his feet.</span></li>
<li><span>He rebuketh the sea, and drieth it up: and bringeth all
the rivers to be a desert. Basan languisheth and Carmel: and the
dower of Libanus fadeth away.</span></li>
<li><span>The mountains tremble at him, and the hills are made
desolate: and the earth hath quaked at his presence, and the world,
and all that dwell therein.</span></li>
<li><span>Who can stand before the face of his indignation? and who
shall resist in the fierceness of his anger? his indignation is
poured out like fire: and the rocks are melted by him.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord is good and giveth strength in the day of
trouble: and knoweth them that hope in him.</span></li>
<li><span>But with a flood that passeth by, he will make an utter
end of the place thereof: and darkness shall pursue his
enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>What do ye devise against the Lord? he will make an utter
end: there shall not rise a double affliction.</span></li>
<li><span>For as thorns embrace one another: so while they are
feasting and drinking together, they shall be consumed as stubble
that is fully dry.</span></li>
<li><span>Out of thee shall come forth one that imagineth evil
against the Lord, contriving treachery in his mind.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: Though they were perfect: and many
of them so, yet thus shall they be cut off, and he shall pass: I
have afflicted thee, and I will afflict thee no more.</span></li>
<li><span>And now I will break in pieces his rod with which he
struck thy back, and I will burst thy bonds asunder.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord will give a commandment concerning thee,
that no more of thy name shall be sown: I will destroy the graven
and molten thing out of the house of thy God, I will make it thy
grave, for thou art disgraced.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth
good tidings, and that preacheth peace: O Juda, keep thy festivals,
and pay thy vows: for Belial shall no more pass through thee again,
he is utterly cut off.</span></li>
</ol>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="2">Nahum 2</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>He is come up that shall destroy before thy face, that
shall keep the siege: watch the way, fortify thy loins, strengthen
thy power exceedingly.</span></li>
<li><span>For the Lord hath rendered the pride of Jacob, as the
pride of Israel: because the spoilers have laid them waste, and
have marred their vine branches.</span></li>
<li><span>The shield of his mighty men is like fire, the men of the
army are clad in scarlet, the reins of the chariot are flaming in
the day of his preparation, and the drivers are
stupefied.</span></li>
<li><span>They are in confusion in the ways, the chariots jostle
one against another in the streets: their looks are like torches,
like lightning running to and fro.</span></li>
<li><span>He will muster up his valiant men, they shall stumble in
their march: they shall quickly get upon the walls thereof: and a
covering shall be prepared.</span></li>
<li><span>The gates of the rivers are opened, and the temple is
thrown down to the ground.</span></li>
<li><span>And the soldier is led away captive: and her bondwomen
were led away mourning as doves, murmuring in their
hearts.</span></li>
<li><span>And as for Ninive, her waters are like a great pool, but
the men flee away. They cry: Stand, stand, but there is none that
will return back.</span></li>
<li><span>Take ye the spoil of the silver, take the spoil of the
gold: for there is no end of the riches of all the precious
furniture.</span></li>
<li><span>She is destroyed, and rent, and torn: the heart melteth,
and the knees fail, and all the loins lose their strength: and the
faces of them all are as the blackness of a kettle.</span></li>
<li><span>Where is now the dwelling of the lions, and the feeding
place of the young lions, to which the lion went, to enter in
thither, the young lion, and there was none to make them
afraid?</span></li>
<li><span>The lion caught enough for his whelps, and killed for his
lionesses: and he filled his holes with prey, and his den with
rapine.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I come against thee, saith the Lord of hosts, and
I will burn thy chariots even to smoke, and the sword shall devour
thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey out of the land, and
the voice of thy messengers shall be heard no more.</span></li>
</ol>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="3">Nahum 3</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Woe to thee, O city of blood, all full of lies and
violence: rapine shall not depart from thee.</span></li>
<li><span>The noise of the whip, and the noise of the rattling of
the wheels, and of the neighing horse, and of the running chariot,
and of the horsemen coming up,</span></li>
<li><span>And of the shining sword, and of the glittering spear,
and of a multitude slain, and of a grievous destruction: and there
is no end of carcasses, and they shall fall down on their dead
bodies.</span></li>
<li><span>Because of the multitude of the fornications of the
harlot that was beautiful and agreeable, and that made use of
witchcraft, that sold nations through her fornications, and
families through her witchcrafts.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I come against thee, saith the Lord of hosts: and
I will discover thy shame to thy face, and will shew thy nakedness
to the nations, and thy shame to kingdoms.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will cast abominations upon thee, and will disgrace
thee, and will make an example of thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall come to pass that every one that shall see
thee, shall flee from thee, and shall say: Ninive is laid waste:
who shall bemoan thee? whence shall I seek a comforter for
thee?</span></li>
<li><span>Art thou better than the populous Alexandria, that
dwelleth among the rivers? waters are round about it: the sea is
its riches, the waters are its walls.</span></li>
<li><span>Ethiopia and Egypt were the strength thereof, and there
is no end: Africa and the Libyans were thy helpers.</span></li>
<li><span>Yet she also was removed and carried into captivity: her
young children were dashed in pieces at the top of every street,
and they cast lots upon her nobles, and all her great men were
bound in fetters.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thou also shalt be made drunk, and shalt be
despised: and thou shalt seek help from the enemy.</span></li>
<li><span>All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with their
green figs: if they be shaken, they shall fall into the mouth of
the eater.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold thy people in the midst of thee are women: the
gates of thy land shall be set wide open to thy enemies, the fire
shall devour thy bars.</span></li>
<li><span>Draw thee water for the siege, build up thy bulwarks: go
into the clay, and tread, work it and make brick.</span></li>
<li><span>There shall the fire devour thee: thou shalt perish by
the sword, it shall devour thee like the bruchus: assemble together
like the bruchus, make thyself many like the locust.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast multiplied thy merchandises above the stars of
heaven: the bruchus hath spread himself and flown away.</span></li>
<li><span>Thy guards are like the locusts: and thy little ones like
the locusts of locusts which swarm on the hedges in the day of
cold: the sun arose, and they flew away, and their place was not
known where they were.</span></li>
<li><span>Thy shepherds have slumbered, O king of Assyria, thy
princes shall be buried: thy people are hid in the mountains, and
there is none to gather them together.</span></li>
<li><span>Thy destruction is not hidden, thy wound is grievous: all
that have heard the fame of thee, have clapped their hands over
thee: for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed
continually?</span></li>
