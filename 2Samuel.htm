<ol>
<li><span>Now it came to pass, after Saul was dead, that David
returned from the slaughter of the Amalecites, and abode two days
in Siceleg.</span></li>
<li><span>And on the third day, there appeared a man who came out
of Saul's camp, with his garments rent, and dust strewed on his
head: and when he came to David, he fell upon his face, and
adored.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to him: From whence comest thou? And he
said to him: I am fled out of the camp of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said unto him: What is the matter that is come
to pass? tell me. He said: The people are fled from the battle, and
many of the people are fallen and dead: moreover Saul and Jonathan
his son are slain.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to the young man that told him: How
knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son, are dead?</span></li>
<li><span>And the young man that told him, said: I came by chance
upon mount Gelboe, and Saul leaned upon his spear: and the chariots
and horsemen drew nigh unto him,</span></li>
<li><span>And looking behind him, and seeing me, he called me. And
I answered, Here am I.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to me: Who art thou? And I said to him: I am
an Amalecite.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to me: Stand over me, and kill me: for
anguish is come upon me, and as yet my whole life is in
me.</span></li>
<li><span>So standing over him, I killed him: for I knew that he
could not live after the fall: and I took the diadem that was on
his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm and have brought
them hither to thee, my lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Then David took hold of his garments and rent them, and
likewise all the men that were with him.</span></li>
<li><span>And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until evening for
Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the Lord, and
for the house of Israel, because they were fallen by the
sword.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to the young man that told him: Whence art
thou? He answered: I am the son of a stranger of
Amalee.</span></li>
<li><span>David said to him: Why didst thou not fear to put out thy
hand to kill the Lord's anointed?</span></li>
<li><span>And David calling one of his servants, said: Go near and
fall upon him. And he struck him so that he died.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to him: Thy blood be upon thy own head:
for thy own mouth hath spoken against thee, saying: I have slain
the Lord's anointed.</span></li>
<li><span>And David made this kind of lamentation over Saul, and
over Jonathan his son.</span></li>
<li><span>(Also he commanded that they should teach the children of
Juda the use of the bow, as it is written in the book of the just.)
And he said: Consider, O Israel, for them that are dead, wounded on
thy high places.</span></li>
<li><span>The illustrious of Israel are slain upon thy mountains:
how are the valiant fallen?</span></li>
<li><span>Tell it not in Geth, publish it not in the streets of
Ascalon: lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the
daughters of the uncircumcised triumph,</span></li>
<li><span>Ye mountains of Gelboe, let neither dew, nor rain come
upon you, neither be they fields of firstfruits: for there was cast
away the shield of the valiant, the shield of Saul as though he had
not been anointed with oil.</span></li>
<li><span>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the valiant,
the arrow of Jonathan never turned back, and the sword of Saul did
not return empty.</span></li>
<li><span>Saul and Jonathan, lovely, and comely in their life, even
in death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles,
stronger than lions.</span></li>
<li><span>Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you
with scarlet in delights, who gave ornaments of gold for your
attire.</span></li>
<li><span>How are the valiant fallen in battle? Jonathan slain in
the high places?</span></li>
<li><span>I grieve for thee, my brother Jonathan: exceeding
beautiful, and amiable to me above the love of women. As the mother
loveth her only son, so did I love thee.</span></li>
<li><span>How are the valiant fallen, and the weapons of war
perished?</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="2">2 Samuel 2</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And after these things David consulted the Lord, saying:
Shall I go up into one of the cities of Juda? And the Lord said to
him: Go up. And David said: Whither shall I go up? And he answered
him: Into Hebron.</span></li>
<li><span>So David went up, and his two wives, Achinoam the
Jezrahelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal of Carmel:</span></li>
<li><span>And the men also that were with him, David brought up
every man with his household: and they abode in the towns of
Hebron.</span></li>
<li><span>And the men of Juda came, and anointed David there, to be
king over the house of Juda. And it was told David, that the men of
Jabes Galaad had buried Saul.</span></li>
<li><span>David therefore sent messengers to the men of Jabes
Galaad, and said to them: Blessed be you to the Lord, who have
shewn this mercy to your master Saul, and have buried
him.</span></li>
<li><span>And now the Lord surely will render you mercy and truth,
and I also will, requite you for this good turn, because you have
done this thing.</span></li>
<li><span>Let your hands be strengthened, and be ye men of valour:
for although your master Saul be dead, yet the house of Juda hath
anointed me to be their king.</span></li>
<li><span>But Abner the son of Ner, general of Saul's army, took
Isboseth the son of Saul, and led him about through the
camp?</span></li>
<li><span>And made him king over Galaad, and, over Gessuri, and
over Jezrahel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Isboseth the son of Saul was forty years old when he
began to reign over, Israel, and he reigned two years: and only the
house of Juda followed David.</span></li>
<li><span>And the number of the days that David abode, reigning in
Hebron over the house of Juda, was seven years and six
months.</span></li>
<li><span>And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Isboseth
the son of Saul, went out from the camp to Gabaon</span></li>
<li><span>And Joab the son of Sarvia, and the servants of David
went out, and met them by the pool of Gabaon. And when they were
come together, they sat down over against one another: the one on
the one side of the pool, and the other on the other
side.</span></li>
<li><span>And Abner said to Joab: Let the young men rise, and play
before us. And Joab answered: Let them rise.</span></li>
<li><span>Then there arose and went over twelve in number of
Benjamin, of the part of Isboseth the son of Saul, and twelve of
the servants of David.</span></li>
<li><span>And every one catching his fellow, by the head, thrust
his sword into the side of his adversary, and they fell down
together: and the name of the place was called: The field of the
valiant, in Gabaon.</span></li>
<li><span>And there was a very fierce battle that day: and Abner
was put to flight, with the men of Israel, by the servants of
David.</span></li>
<li><span>And there were the three sons of Sarvia there, Joab, and
Abisai, and Asael: now Asael was a most swift runner, like one of
the roes that abide in the woods.</span></li>
<li><span>And Asael pursued after Abner, and turned not to the
right hand nor to the left from following Abner.</span></li>
<li><span>And Abner looked behind him, and said: Art thou Asael?
And he answered: I am.</span></li>
<li><span>And Abner said to him: Go to the right hand or to the
left, and lay hold on one of the young men and take thee his
spoils. But Asael would not leave off following him
close.</span></li>
<li><span>And again Abner said to Asael: Go off, and do not follow
me, lest I be obliged to stab thee to the ground, and I shall not
be able to hold up my face to Joab thy brother.</span></li>
<li><span>But he refused to hearken to him, and would not turn
aside: wherefore Abner struck him with his spear with a back stroke
in the groin, and thrust him through, and he died upon the spot:
and all that came to the place where Asael fell down and died stood
still.</span></li>
<li><span>Now while Joab and Abisai pursued after Abner, the sun
went down: and they came as far as the hill of the aqueduct, that
lieth over against the valley by the way of the wilderness in
Gabaon.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together
to Abner: and being joined in one body, they stood on the top of a
hill.</span></li>
<li><span>And Abner cried out to Joab, and said: Shall thy sword
rage unto utter destruction? knowest thou not that it is dangerous
to drive people to despair? how long dost thou defer to bid the
people cease from pursuing after their brethren?</span></li>
<li><span>And Joab said: As the Lord liveth, if thou hadst spoke
sooner, even in the morning the people should have retired from
pursuing after their brethren.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Joab sounded the trumpet, and all the army stood
still, and did not pursue after Israel any farther, nor fight any
more.</span></li>
<li><span>And Abner and his men walked all that night through the
plains: and they passed the Jordan, and having gone through all
Beth-horon, came to the camp.</span></li>
<li><span>And Joab returning, after he had left Abner, assembled
all the people: and there were wanting of David's servants nineteen
men, beside Asael.</span></li>
<li><span>But the servants of David had killed of Benjamin, and of
the men that were with Abner, three hundred and sixty, who all
died.</span></li>
<li><span>And they took Asael, and buried him in the sepulchre of
his father in Bethlehem, and Joab, and the men that were with him,
marched all the night, and they came to Hebron at break of
day.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="3">2 Samuel 3</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Now there was a long war between the house of Saul and
the house of David: David prospering and growing always stronger
and stronger, but the house of Saul decaying daily.</span></li>
<li><span>And sons were born to David in Hebron: and his firstborn
was Amnon of Achinoam the Jezrahelitess:</span></li>
<li><span>And his second Cheleab of Abigail the wife of Nabal of
Carmel: and the third Absalom the son of Maacha the daughter of
Tholmai king of Gessur:</span></li>
<li><span>And the fourth Adonias, the son of Haggith: and the fifth
Saphathia the son of Abital:</span></li>
<li><span>And the sixth Jethraam of Egla the wife of David: these
were born to David in Hebron.</span></li>
<li><span>Now while there was war between the house of Saul and the
house of David, Abner the son of Ner ruled the house of
Saul.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul had a concubine named Respha, the daughter of
Aia. And Isboseth said to Abner:</span></li>
<li><span>Why didst thou go in to my father's concubine? And he was
exceedingly angry for the words of Isboseth, and said: Am I a dog's
head against Juda this day, who have shewn mercy to the house of
Saul thy father, and to his brethren and friends, and have not
delivered thee into the hands of David, and hast thou sought this
day against me to charge me with a matter concerning a
woman?</span></li>
<li><span>So do God to Abner, and more also, unless as the Lord
hath sworn to David, so I do to him,</span></li>
<li><span>That the kingdom be translated from the house of Saul,
and the throne of David be set up over Israel, and over Juda from
Dan to Bersabee.</span></li>
<li><span>And he could not answer him a word, because he feared
him.</span></li>
<li><span>Abner therefore sent messengers to David for himself,
saying: Whose is the land? and that they should say: Make a league
with me, and my hand shall be with thee: and I will bring all
Israel to thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said: Very well: I will make a league with thee:
but one thing I require of thee, saying: Thou shalt not see my face
before thou bring Michol the daughter of Saul: and so thou shalt
come, and see me.</span></li>
<li><span>And David sent messengers to Isboseth the son of Saul,
saying: Restore my wife Michol, whom I espoused to me for a hundred
foreskins of the Philistines.</span></li>
<li><span>And Isboseth sent, and took her from her husband
Phaltiel, the son of Lais.</span></li>
<li><span>And her husband followed her, weeping as far as Bahurim:
and Abner said to him: Go and return. And he returned.</span></li>
<li><span>Abner also spoke to the ancients of Israel, saying: Both
yesterday and the day before you sought for David that he might
reign over you.</span></li>
<li><span>Now then do it: because the Lord hath spoken to David,
saying: By the hand of my servant David I will save my people
Israel from the hands of the Philistines, and of all their
enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>And Abner spoke also to Benjamin. And he went to speak to
David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and to all
Benjamin.</span></li>
<li><span>And he came to David in Hebron with twenty men: and David
made a feast for Abner, and his men that came with him.</span></li>
<li><span>And Abner said to David: I will rise, that I may gather
all Israel unto thee my lord the king, and may enter into a league
with thee, and that thou mayst reign over all as thy soul desireth.
Now when David bad brought Abner on his way, and he was gone in
peace,</span></li>
<li><span>Immediately David's servants and Joab came, after having
slain the robbers, with an exceeding great booty: and Abner, was
not with David in Hebron, for he had now sent him away, and he was
gone in peace.</span></li>
<li><span>And Joab and all the army that was with him, came
afterwards: and it was told Joab, that Abner the son of Ner came to
the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in
peace.</span></li>
<li><span>And Joab went in to the king, and said: What hast thou
done? Behold Abner came to thee: Why didst thou send him away, and
he is gone and departed?</span></li>
<li><span>Knowest thou not Abner the son of Ner, that to this end
he came to thee, that he might deceive thee, and to know thy going
out, and thy coming in, and to know all thou dost?</span></li>
<li><span>Then Joab going out from David, sent messengers after
Abner, and brought him back from the cistern of Sira, David knowing
nothing of it.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him
aside to the middle of the gate, to speak to him treacherously: and
he stabbed him there in the groin, and he died, in revenge of the
blood of Asael his brother.</span></li>
<li><span>And when David heard of it, after the thing was now done,
he said: I, and my kingdom are innocent before the Lord for ever of
the blood of Abner the son of Ner:</span></li>
<li><span>And may it come upon the head of Joab, and upon all his
father's house: and let there not fail from the house of Joab one
that hath an issue of seed, or that is a leper, or that holdeth the
distaff, or that falleth by the sword, or that wanteth
bread.</span></li>
<li><span>So Joab and Abisai his brother slew Abner, because he had
killed their brother Asael at Gabaon in the battle.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were
with him: Rend your garments, and gird yourselves with sackcloths,
and mourn before the funeral of Abner. And king David himself
followed the bier.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they had buried Abner in Hebron, king David
lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner: and all the
people also wept.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king mourning and lamenting over Abner, said: Not
as cowards are wont to die, hath Abner died.</span></li>
<li><span>Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet laden with
fetters: but as men fall before the children of iniquity, so didst
thou fall. And all the people repeating it wept over
him.</span></li>
<li><span>And when all the people came to take meat with David,
while it was yet broad day, David swore, saying: So do God to me,
and more also, if I taste bread or any thing else before
sunset.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the people heard, and they were pleased, and all
that the king did seemed good in the sight of all the
people.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the people, and all Israel understood that day
that it was not the king's doing, that Abner the son of Ner was
slain.</span></li>
<li><span>The king also said to his servants: Do you not know that
a prince and great man is slain this day in Israel?</span></li>
<li><span>But I as yet am tender, though anointed king. And these
men the sons of Sarvia are too hard for me: the Lord reward him
that doth evil according to his wickedness.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="4">2 Samuel 4</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And Isboseth the son of Saul heard that Abner was slain
in Hebron: and his hands were weakened, and all Israel was
troubled.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the son of Saul had two men captains of his bands,
the name of the one was Baana, and the name of the other Rechab,
the sons of Remmon a Berothite of the children of Benjamin: for
Beroth also was reckoned in Benjamin.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Berothites fled into Gethaim, and were sojourners
there until that time.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jonathan the son of Saul bad a son that was lame of
his feet: for he was five years old when the tidings came of Saul
and Jonathan from Jezrahel. And his nurse took him up and fled: and
as she made haste to flee, he fell and became lame: and his name
was Miphiboseth.</span></li>
<li><span>And the sons of Remmon the Berothite, Rechab and Baana
coming, went into the house of Isboseth in the heat of the day: and
he was sleeping upon his bed at noon. And the doorkeeper of the
house, who was cleansing wheat, was fallen asleep.</span></li>
<li><span>And they entered into the house secretly taking ears of
corn, and Rechab and Baana his brother stabbed him in the groin,
and fled away.</span></li>
<li><span>For when they came into the house, be was sleeping upon
his bed in a parlour, and they struck him and killed him: and
taking away his head they went off by the way of the wilderness,
walking all night.</span></li>
<li><span>And they brought the head of Isboseth to David to Hebron:
and they said to the king: Behold the head of Isboseth the son of
Saul thy enemy who sought thy life: and the Lord hath revenged my
lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.</span></li>
<li><span>But David answered Rechab, and Baana his brother, the
sons of Remmon the Berothite, and said to them: As the Lord liveth,
who hath delivered my soul out of all distress,</span></li>
<li><span>The man that told me, and said: Saul is dead, who thought
he brought good tidings, I apprehended, and slew him in Siceleg,
who should have been rewarded for his news.</span></li>
<li><span>How much more now when wicked men have slain an innocent
man in his own house, upon his bed, shall I not require his blood
at your hand, and take you away from the earth?</span></li>
<li><span>And David commanded his servants and they slew them: and
cutting off their hands and feet, hanged them up over the pool in
Hebron: but the head of Isboseth they took and buried in the
sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="5">2 Samuel 5</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Then all the tribes of Israel came to David in Hebron,
saying: Behold we are thy bone and thy flesh.</span></li>
<li><span>1O And he went on prospering and growing up, and the Lord
God of hosts was with him.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover yesterday also and the day before, when Saul was
king over us, thou wast he that did lead out and bring in Israel:
and the Lord said to thee: Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and
thou shalt be prince over Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>The ancients also of Israel came to the king to Hebron,
and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the Lord:
and they anointed David to be king over Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he
reigned forty years.</span></li>
<li><span>In Hebron he reigned over Juda seven years and six
months: and in Jerusalem he reigned three and thirty years over all
Israel and Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king and all the men that were with him went to
Jerusalem to the Jebusites the inhabitants of the land: and they
said to David: Thou shalt not come in hither unless thou take away
the blind and the lame that say: David shall not come in
hither.</span></li>
<li><span>But David took the castle of Sion, the same is the city
of David.</span></li>
<li><span>For David had offered that day a reward to whosoever
should strike the Jebusites and get up to the gutters of the tops
of the houses, and take away the blind and the lame that hated the
soul of David: therefore it is said in the proverb: The blind and
the lame shall not come into the temple.</span></li>
<li><span>And David dwelt in the castle, and called it, The city of
David: and built round about from Mello and inwards.</span></li>
<li><span>And Hiram the king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and
cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons for walls: and they built a
house for David.</span></li>
<li><span>And David knew that the Lord bad confirmed him king over
Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom over his people
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And David took more concubines and wives of Jerusalem,
after he was come from Hebron: and there were born to David other
sons also and daughters:</span></li>
<li><span>And these are the names of them, that were born to him in
Jerusalem, Samua, and Sobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,</span></li>
<li><span>And Jebahar, and Elisua, and Nepheg,</span></li>
<li><span>And Japhia, and Elisama, and Elioda, and
Eliphaleth.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Philistines heard that they had anointed David to
be king over Israel: and they all came to seek David: and when
David heard of it, he went down to a strong hold.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Philistines coming spread themselves in the
valley of Raphaim.</span></li>
<li><span>And David consulted the Lord, saying: Shall I go up to
the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And the
Lord said to David: Go up, for I will surely deliver the
Philistines into thy hand.</span></li>
<li><span>And David came to Baal Pharisim: and defeated them there,
and he said: The Lord hath divided my enemies before me, as waters
are divided. Therefore the name of the place was called Baal
Pharisim.</span></li>
<li><span>And they left there their idols: which David and his men
took away.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Philistines came up again and spread themselves
in the valley of Raphaim.</span></li>
<li><span>And David consulted the Lord: Shall I go up against the
Philistines, and wilt thou deliver them into my hands? He answered:
Go not up against them, but fetch a compass behind them, and thou
shalt come upon them over against the pear trees.</span></li>
<li><span>And when thou shalt hear the sound of one going in the
tops of the pear trees, then shalt thou join battle: for then will
the Lord go out before thy face to strike the army of the
Philistines.</span></li>
<li><span>And David did as the Lord had commanded him, and he smote
the Philistines from Gabaa until thou come to Gezer.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="6">2 Samuel 6</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And David again gathered together all the chosen men of
Israel, thirty thousand.</span></li>
<li><span>And David arose and went, with all the people that were
with him of the men of Juda to fetch the ark of God, upon which the
name of the Lord of hosts is invoked, who sitteth over it upon the
cherubims.</span></li>
<li><span>And they laid the ark of God upon a new cart: and took it
out of the house of Abinadab, who was in Gabaa: and Oza, and Ahio,
the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they had taken it out of the house of Abinadab,
who was in Gabaa, Ahio having care of the ark of God went before
the ark.</span></li>
<li><span>But David and all Israel played before the Lord on all
manner of instruments made of wood, on harps and lutes and timbrels
and cornets and cymbals.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they came to the floor of Nachon, Oza put forth
his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it: because the oxen
kicked and made it lean aside.</span></li>
<li><span>And the indignation of the Lord was enkindled against
Oza, and he struck him for his rashness: and he died there before
the ark of God.</span></li>
<li><span>And David was grieved because the Lord had struck Oza,
and the name of that place was called: The striking of Oza, to this
day.</span></li>
<li><span>And David was afraid of the Lord that day, saying: How
shall the ark of the Lord come to me?</span></li>
<li><span>And he would not have the ark of the Lord brought in to
himself into the city of David: but he caused it to be carried into
the house of Obededom the Gethite.</span></li>
<li><span>And the ark of the Lord abode in the house of Obededom
the Gethite three months: and the Lord blessed Obededom, and all
his household.</span></li>
<li><span>And it was told king David, that the Lord had blessed
Obededom, and all that he had, because of the ark of God. So David
went, and brought away the ark of God out of the house of Obededom
into the city of David with joy. And there were with David seven
choirs, and calves for victims.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they that carried the ark of the Lord had gone
six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a ram:</span></li>
<li><span>And David danced with all his might before the Lord: and
David was girded with a linen ephod.</span></li>
<li><span>And David and all the house of Israel brought the ark of
the covenant of the Lord with joyful shouting, and with sound of
trumpet.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the ark of the Lord was come into the city of
David, Michol the daughter of Saul, looking out through a window,
saw king David leaping and dancing before the Lord: and she
despised him in her heart.</span></li>
<li><span>And they brought the ark of the Lord, and set it in its
place in the midst of the tabernacle, which David had pitched for
it: and David offered holocausts, and peace offerings before the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he had made an end of offering holocausts and
peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord of
hosts.</span></li>
<li><span>And he distributed to all the multitude of Israel both
men and women, to every one, a cake of bread, and a piece of
roasted beef, and fine flour fried with oil: and all the people
departed every one to his house.</span></li>
<li><span>And David returned to bless his own house: and Michol the
daughter of Saul coming out to meet David, said: How glorious was
the king of Israel to day, uncovering himself before the handmaids
of his servants, and was naked, as if one of the buffoons should be
naked.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to Michol: Before the Lord, who chose me
rather than thy father, and than all his house, and commanded me to
be ruler over the people of the Lord in Israel,</span></li>
<li><span>I will both play and make myself meaner than I have done:
and I will be little in my own eyes: and with the handmaid of whom
thou speakest, I shall appear more glorious.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore Michol the daughter of Saul had no child to the
day of her death.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="7">2 Samuel 7</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And it came to pass when the king sat in his house, and
the Lord had given him rest on every side from all his
enemies,</span></li>
<li><span>He said to Nathan the prophet: Dost thou see that I dwell
in a house of cedar, and the ark of God is lodged within
skins?</span></li>
<li><span>And Nathan said to the king: Go, do all that is in thy
heart: because the Lord is with thee.</span></li>
<li><span>But it came to pass that night, that the word of the Lord
came to Nathan, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Go, and say to my servant David: Thus saith the Lord:
Shalt thou build me a house to dwell in?</span></li>
<li><span>Whereas I have not dwelt in a house from the day that I
brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt even to
this day: but have walked in a tabernacle, and in a
tent.</span></li>
<li><span>In all the places that I have gone through with all the
children of Israel, did ever I speak a word to any one of the
tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel,
saying: Why have you not built me a house of cedar?</span></li>
<li><span>And now thus shalt thou speak to my servant David: Thus
saith the Lord of hosts: a I took thee out of the pastures from
following the sheep to be ruler over my people Israel:</span></li>
<li><span>And I have been with thee wheresoever thou hast walked,
and have slain all thy enemies from before thy face: and I have
made thee a great man, like unto the name of the great ones that
are on the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and I
will plant them, and they shall dwell therein, and shall be
disturbed no more: neither shall the children of iniquity afflict
them any more as they did before,</span></li>
<li><span>From the day that I appointed judges over my people
Israel: and I will give thee rest from all thy enemies. And the
Lord foretelleth to thee, that the Lord will make thee a
house.</span></li>
<li><span>And when thy days shall be fulfilled, and thou shalt
sleep with thy fathers, I will raise up thy seed after thee, which
shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his
kingdom.</span></li>
<li><span>He shall build a house to my name, and I will establish
the throne of his kingdom for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son:
and if he commit any iniquity, I will correct him with the rod of
men, and with the stripes of the children of men.</span></li>
<li><span>But my mercy I will not take away from him, as I took it
from Saul, whom I removed from before my face.</span></li>
<li><span>And thy house shall be faithful, and thy kingdom for ever
before thy face, and thy throne shall be firm for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>According to all these words and according to all this
vision, so did Nathan speak to David.</span></li>
<li><span>And David went in, and sat before the Lord, and said: Who
am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me
thus far?</span></li>
<li><span>But yet this hath seemed little in thy sight, O Lord God,
unless thou didst also speak of the house of thy servant for a long
time to come: for this is the law of Adam, O Lord God.</span></li>
<li><span>And what can David say more unto thee? for thou knowest
thy servant, O Lord God:</span></li>
<li><span>For thy word's sake, and according to thy own heart thou
hast done all these great things, so that thou wouldst make it
known to thy servant.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thou art magnified, O Lord God, because there
is none like to thee, neither is there any God besides thee, in all
the things that we have heard with our ears.</span></li>
<li><span>And what nation is there upon earth, as thy people
Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to
make him a name, and to do for them great and terrible things, upon
the earth, before the face of thy people, whom thou redeemedst to
thyself out of Egypt, from the nations and their gods.</span></li>
<li><span>For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to
be an everlasting people: and thou, O Lord God, art become their
God.</span></li>
<li><span>And now, O Lord God, raise up for ever the word that thou
hast spoken, concerning thy servant and concerning his house: and
do as thou hast spoken,</span></li>
<li><span>That thy name may be magnified for ever, and it may be
said: The Lord of hosts is God over Israel. And the house of thy
servant David shall be established before the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Because thou, O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, hast
revealed to the ear of thy servant, saying: I will build thee a
house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this
prayer to thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And now, O Lord God, thou art God, and thy words shall be
true: for thou hast spoken to thy servant these good
things.</span></li>
<li><span>And now begin, and bless the house of thy servant, that
it may endure for ever before thee: because thou, O Lord God, hast
spoken it, and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be
blessed for ever.</span></li>

<li><span>And it came to pass after this that David defeated the
Philistines, and brought them down, and David took the bridle of
tribute out of the hand of the Philistines.</span></li>
<li><span>And he defeated Moab, and measured them with a line,
casting them down to the earth: and he measured with two lines, one
to put to death, and one to save alive: and Moab was made to serve
David under tribute.</span></li>
<li><span>David defeated also Adarezer the son of Rohob king of
Soba, when he went to extend his dominion over the river
Euphrates.</span></li>
<li><span>And David took from him a thousand and seven hundred
horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen, and houghed all the chariot
horses: and only reserved of them for one hundred
chariots.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Adarezer the
king of Soba: and David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand
men.</span></li>
<li><span>And David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and Syria
served David under tribute: and the Lord preserved David in all his
enterprises, whithersoever he went.</span></li>
<li><span>And David took the arms of gold, which the servants of
Adarezer wore, and brought them to Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And out of Bete, and out of Beroth, cities of Adarezer,
king David took an exceeding great quantity of brass.</span></li>
<li><span>And Thou the king of Emath heard that David had defeated
all the forces of Adarezer.</span></li>
<li><span>And Thou sent Joram his son to king David, to salute him,
and to congratulate with him, and to return him thanks: because he
had fought against Adarezer, and had defeated him. For Thou was an
enemy to Adarezer, and in his hand were vessels of gold, and
vessels of silver, and vessels of brass:</span></li>
<li><span>And king David dedicated them to the Lord, together with
the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all the nations, which
he had subdued:</span></li>
<li><span>Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and
of the Philistines, and of Amalec, and of the spoils of Adarezer
the son of Rohob king of Soba.</span></li>

taking Syria in the valley of the saltpits, killing eighteen
thousand:</span></li>

Josaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder:</span></li>

<li><span>And David said: Is there any one, think you, left of the
house of Saul, that I may shew kindness to him for Jonathan's
sake?</span></li>
<li><span>Now there was of the house of Saul, a servant named Siba:
and when the king had called him to him, he said to him: Art thou
Siba? And he answered: I am Siba thy servant.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said: Is there any one left of the house of
Saul, that I may shew the mercy of God unto him? And Siba said to
the king: There is a son of Jonathan left, who is lame of his
feet.</span></li>
<li><span>Where is he? said he. And Siba said to the king: Behold
he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel in
Lodabar.</span></li>
<li><span>Then king David sent, and brought him out of the house of
Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodabar.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Miphiboseth the son of Jonathan the son of Saul
was come to David, he fell on his face and worshipped. And David
said: Miphiboseth? And he answered: Behold thy servant.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to him: Fear not, for I will surely shew
thee mercy for Jonathan thy father's sake, and I will restore the
lands of Saul thy father, and thou shalt eat bread at my table
always.</span></li>
<li><span>He bowed down to him, and said: Who am I thy servant,
that thou shouldst look upon such a dead dog as I am?</span></li>
<li><span>Then the king called Siba the servant of Saul, and said
to him: All that belonged to Saul, and all his house, I have given
to thy master's son.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou therefore and thy sons and thy servants shall till
the land for him: and thou shalt bring in food for thy master's
son, that he may be maintained: and Miphiboseth the son of thy
master shall always eat bread at my table. And Siba had fifteen
sons and twenty servants.</span></li>
<li><span>And Siba said to the king: As thou my lord the king hast
commanded thy servant, so will thy servant do: and Miphiboseth
shall eat at my table, as one of the sons of the king.</span></li>
<li><span>And Miphiboseth had a young son whose name was Micha: and
all the kindred of the house of Siba served
Miphiboseth.</span></li>

<li><span>And it came to pass after this, that the king of the
children of Ammon died, and Hanon his son reigned in his
stead.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said: I Will shew kindness to Hanon the son of
Daas, as his father shewed kindness to me. So David sent his
servants to comfort him for the death of his father. But when the
servants of David were come into the land of the children of
Ammon,</span></li>
<li><span>The princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanon their
lord: Thinkest thou that for the honour of thy father, David hath
sent comforters to thee, and hath not David rather sent his
servants to thee to search, and spy into the city, and overthrow
it?</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore Hanon took the servants of David, and shaved
off the one half of their beards, and cut away half of their
garments even to the buttocks, and sent them away.</span></li>
<li><span>When this was told David, he sent to meet them: for the
men were sadly put to confusion, and David commanded them, saying:
Stay at Jericho, till your beards be grown, and then
return.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Ammon seeing that they had done an
injury to David, Bent and hired the Syrians of Rohob, and the
Syrians of Soba, twenty thousand footmen, and of the king of Maacha
a thousand men, and of Istob twelve thousand men.</span></li>
<li><span>And when David heard this, he sent Joab and the whole
army of warriors.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Ammon came out, and set their men in
array at the entering in of the gate: but the Syrians of Soba, and
of Rohob, and of Istob, and of Maacha were by themselves in the
field.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Joab seeing that the battle was prepared against
him, both before and behind, chose of all the choice men of Israel,
and put them in array against the Syrians:</span></li>
<li><span>And the rest of the people he delivered to Abisai his
brother, who set them in array against the children of
Ammon.</span></li>
<li><span>And Joab said: If the Syrians are too strong for me, then
thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon are too strong for
thee, then I will help thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Be of good courage, and let us fight for our people, and
for the city of our God: and the Lord will do what is good in his
sight.</span></li>
<li><span>And Joab and the people that were with him, began to
fight against the Syrians: and they immediately fled before
him.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Ammon seeing that the Syrians were
fled, they fled also before Abisai, and entered into the city: and
Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to
Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>Then the Syrians seeing that they had fallen before
Israel, gathered themselves together.</span></li>
<li><span>And Adarezer sent and fetched the Syrians, that were
beyond the river, and brought over their army: and Sobach, the
captain of the host of Adarezer, was their general.</span></li>
<li><span>And when this was told David, he gathered all Israel
together, and passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam: and the
Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought against
him.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Syrians fled before Israel, and David slew of the
Syrians the men of seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand
horsemen: and smote Sobach the captain of the army, who presently
died.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the kings that were auxiliaries of Adarezer,
seeing themselves overcome by Israel, were afraid and fled away,
eight and fifty thousand men before Israel. And they made peace
with Israel: and served them, and all the Syrians were afraid to
help the children of Ammon any more.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="11">2 Samuel 11</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And it came to pass at the return of the year, at the
time when kings go forth to war, that David sent Joab and his
servants with him, and all Israel, and they spoiled the children of
Ammon, and besieged Rabba: but David remained in
Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>In the mean time it happened that David arose from his
bed after noon, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and
he saw from the roof of his house a woman washing herself, over
against him: and the woman was very beautiful.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king sent, and inquired who the woman was. And it
was told him, that she was Bethsabee the daughter of Eliam, the
wife of Urias the Hethite.</span></li>
<li><span>And David sent messengers, and took her, and she came in
to him, and he slept with her: and presently she was purified from
her uncleanness:</span></li>
<li><span>And she returned to her house having conceived. And she
sent and told David, and said: I have conceived.</span></li>
<li><span>And David sent to Joab, saying: Send me Urias the
Hethite. And Joab sent Urias to David.</span></li>
<li><span>And Urias came to David. And David asked how Joab did,
and the people, and how the war was carried on.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to Urias: Go into thy house, and wash thy
feet. And Urias went out from the king's house, and there went out
after him a mess of meat from the king.</span></li>
<li><span>But Urias slept before the gate of the king's house, with
the other servants of his lord, and went not down to his own
house.</span></li>
<li><span>And it was told David by some that said: Urias went not
to his house. And David said to Urias: Didst thou not come from thy
journey? why didst thou not go down to thy house?</span></li>
<li><span>And Urias said to David: The ark of God and Israel and
Juda dwell in tents, and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord
abide upon the face of the earth: and shall I go into my house, to
eat and to drink, and to sleep with my wife? By thy welfare and by
the welfare of thy soul I will not do this thing.</span></li>
<li><span>Then David said to Urias: Tarry here to day, and to
morrow I will send thee away. Urias tarried in Jerusalem that day
and the next.</span></li>
<li><span>And David called him to eat and to drink before him, and
he made him drunk: and he went out in the evening, and slept on his
couch with the servants of his lord, and went not down into his
house.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the morning was come, David wrote a letter to
Joab: and sent it by the hand of Urias,</span></li>
<li><span>Writing in the letter: Set ye Urias in the front of the
battle, where the fight is strongest: and leave ye him, that he may
be wounded and die.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore as Joab was besieging the city, he put Urias in
the place where he knew the bravest men were.</span></li>
<li><span>And the men coming out of the city, fought against Joab,
and there fell some of the people of the servants of David, and
Urias the Hethite was killed also.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Joab sent, and told David all things concerning the
battle.</span></li>
<li><span>And he charged the messenger, saying: When thou hast told
all the words of the battle to the king,</span></li>
<li><span>If thou see him to be angry, and he shall say: Why did
you approach so near to the wall to fight? knew you not that many
darts are thrown from above off the wall?</span></li>
<li><span>Who killed Abimelech the son of Jerobaal? did not a woman
cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, and slew him in
Thebes? Why did you go near the wall? Thou shalt say: Thy servant
Urias the Hethite is also slain.</span></li>
<li><span>So the messenger departed, and came and told David all
that Joab had commanded him.</span></li>
<li><span>And the messenger said to David: The men prevailed
against us, and they came out to us into the field: and we
vigorously charged and pursued them even to the gate of the
city.</span></li>
<li><span>And the archers shot their arrows at thy servants from
off the wall above: and some of the king's servants are slain, and
thy servant Urias the Hethite is also dead.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to the messenger: Thus shalt thou say to
Joab: Let not this thing discourage thee: for various is the event
of war: and sometimes one, sometimes another is consumed by the
sword: encourage thy warriors against The city, and exhort them
that thou mayest overthrow it.</span></li>
<li><span>And the wife of Urias heard that Urias her husband was
dead, and she mourned for him.</span></li>
<li><span>And the mourning being over, David sent and brought her
into his house, and she became his wife, and she bore him a son:
and this thing which David had done, was displeasing to the
Lord.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="12">2 Samuel 12</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And the Lord sent Nathan to David: and when he was come
to him, he said to him: There were two men in one city, the one
rich, and the other poor.</span></li>
<li><span>The rich man had exceeding many sheep and
oxen.</span></li>
<li><span>But the poor man had nothing at all but one little ewe
lamb, which he had bought and nourished up, and which had grown up
in his house together with his children, eating of his bread, and
drinking of his cup, and sleeping in his bosom: and it was unto him
as a daughter.</span></li>
<li><span>And when a certain stranger was come to the rich man, he
spared to take of his own sheep and oxen, to make a feast for that
stranger, who was come to him, but took the poor man's ewe, and
dressed it for the man that was come to him.</span></li>
<li><span>And David's anger being exceedingly kindled against that
man, he said to Nathan: As the Lord liveth, the man that hath done
this is a child of death.</span></li>
<li><span>He shall restore the ewe fourfold, because he did this
thing, and had no pity.</span></li>
<li><span>And Nathan said to David: Thou art the man. Thus saith
the Lord the God of Israel: I anointed thee king over Israel, and I
delivered thee from the hand of Saul,</span></li>
<li><span>And gave thee thy master's house and thy master's wives
into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and Juda: and if
these things be little, I shall add far greater things unto
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Why therefore hast thou despised the word of the Lord, to
do evil in my sight? Thou hast killed Urias the Hethite with the
sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him
with the sword of the children of Ammon.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house,
because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Urias the
Hethite to be thy wife.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: Behold, I will raise up evil against
thee out of thy own house, and I will take thy wives before thy
eyes I and give them to thy neighhour, and he shall lie with thy
wives in the sight of this sun.</span></li>
<li><span>For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing in
the sight of all Israel, and in the sight of the sun.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to Nathan: I have sinned against the Lord.
And Nathan said to David: The Lord also hath taken away thy sin:
thou shalt not die.</span></li>
<li><span>Nevertheless, because thou hast given occasion to the
enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, for this thing, the child that is
born to thee, shall surely die.</span></li>
<li><span>And Nathan returned to his house. The Lord also struck
the child which the wife of Urias had borne to David, and his life
was despaired of.</span></li>
<li><span>And David besought the Lord for the child: and David kept
a fast, and going in by himself lay upon the ground.</span></li>
<li><span>And the ancients of his house came, to make him rise from
the ground: but he would not, neither did he eat meat with
them.</span></li>
<li><span>And it came to pass on the seventh day that the child
died: and the servants of David feared to tell him, that the child
was dead. For they said: Behold when the child was yet alive, we
spoke to him, and he would not hearken to our voice: how much more
will he afflict himself if we tell him that the child is
dead?</span></li>
<li><span>But when David saw his servants whispering, he understood
that the child was dead: and he said to his servants: Is the child
dead? They answered him: He is dead.</span></li>
<li><span>Then David arose from the ground, and washed and anointed
himself: and when he had changed his apparel, he went into the
house of the Lord: and worshipped, and then he came into his own
house, and he called for bread, and ate.</span></li>
<li><span>And his servants said to him: What thing is this that
thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it
was alive, but when the child was dead, thou didst rise up, and eat
bread.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said: While the child was yet alive, I fasted and
wept for him: for I said: Who knoweth whether the Lord may not give
him to me, and the child may live?</span></li>
<li><span>But now that he is dead, why should I fast? Shall I be
able to bring him back any more? I shall go to him rather: but he
shall not return to me.</span></li>
<li><span>And David comforted Bethsabee his wife, and went in unto
her, and slept with her: I and she bore a son, and he called his
name Solomon, and the Lord loved him.</span></li>
<li><span>And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and called
his name, Amiable to the Lord, because the Lord loved
him.</span></li>
<li><span>And Joab fought against Rabbath of the children of Ammon,
and laid close siege to the royal city.</span></li>
<li><span>And Joab sent messengers to David, saying: I have fought
against Rabbath, and the city of waters is about to be
taken.</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore gather thou the rest of the people
together, and besiege the city and take it: lest when the city
shall be wasted by me, the victory be ascribed to my
name.</span></li>
<li><span>Then David gathered all the people together, and went out
against Rabbath: and after fighting, he took it.</span></li>
<li><span>And he took the crown of their king from his head, the
weight of which was a talent of gold, set with most precious
stones, and it was put upon David's head, and the spoils of the
city which were very great he carried away.</span></li>
<li><span>And bringing forth the people thereof he sawed them, and
drove over them chariots armed with iron: and divided them with
knives, and made them pass through brickkilns: so did he to all the
cities of the children of Ammon: and David returned, with all the
army to Jerusalem.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="13">2 Samuel 13</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And it came to pass after this, that Amnon the son of
David loved the sister of Absalom the son of David, who was very
beautiful, and her name was Thamar.</span></li>
<li><span>And he was exceedingly fond of her, so that he fell sick
for the love of her: for as she was a virgin, he thought it hard to
do any thing dishonestly with her.</span></li>
<li><span>Now Amnon had a friend, named Jonadab the son of Semmaa
the brother of David, a very wise man:</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to him: Why dost thou grow so lean from day
to day, O son of the king? why dost thou not tell me the reason of
it? And Amnon said to him: I am in love with Thamar the sister of
my brother Absalom.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jonadab said to him: Lie down upon thy bed, and feign
thyself sick: and when thy father shall come to visit thee, say to
him: Let my sister Thamar, I pray thee, come to me, to give me to
eat, and to make me a mess, that I may eat it at her
hand.</span></li>
<li><span>So Amnon lay down, and made as if he were sick: and when
the king came to visit him, Amnon said to the king: I pray thee let
my sister Thamar come, and make in my sight two little messes, that
I may eat at her hand.</span></li>
<li><span>Then David sent home to Thamar, saying: Come to the house
of thy brother Amnon, and make him a mess.</span></li>
<li><span>And Thamar came to the house of Amnon her brother: but he
was laid down: and she took meal and tempered it: and dissolving it
in his sight she made little messes.</span></li>
<li><span>And taking what she had boiled, she poured it out, and
set it before him, but he would not eat: and Amnon said: Put out
all persons from me. And when they had put all persons
out,</span></li>
<li><span>Amnon said to Thamar: Bring the mess into the chamber,
that I may eat at thy hand. And Thamar took the little messes which
she had made, and brought them in to her brother Amnon in the
chamber.</span></li>
<li><span>And when she had presented him the meat, he took hold of
her, and said: Come lie with me, my sister.</span></li>
<li><span>She answered him: Do not so, my brother, do not force me:
for no such thing must be done in Israel. Do not thou this
folly.</span></li>
<li><span>For I shall not be able to bear my shame, and thou shalt
be as one of the fools in Israel: but rather speak to the king, and
he will not deny me to thee.</span></li>
<li><span>But he would not hearken to her prayers, but being
stronger overpowered her and lay with her.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Amnon hated her with an exceeding great hatred: so
that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love
with which he had loved her before, And Amnon said to her: Arise,
and get thee gone.</span></li>
<li><span>She answered him: This evil which now thou dost against
me, in driving me away, is greater than that which thou didst
before. And he would not hearken to her:</span></li>
<li><span>But calling the servants that ministered to him, he said:
Thrust this woman out from me: and shut the door after
her.</span></li>
<li><span>And she was clothed with along robe: for the king's
daughters that were virgins, used such kind of garments. Then his
servant thrust her out: and shut the door after her.</span></li>
<li><span>And she put ashes on her head, and rent her long robe and
laid her hands upon her head, and went on crying.</span></li>
<li><span>And Absalom her brother said to her: Hath thy brother
Amnon lain with thee? but now, sister, hold thy peace, he is thy
brother: and afflict not thy heart for this thing. So Thamar
remained pining away in the house of Absalom her
brother.</span></li>
<li><span>And when king David heard of these things he was
exceedingly grieved: and he would not afflict the spirit of his son
Amnon, for he loved him, because he was his firstborn.</span></li>
<li><span>But Absalom spoke not to Amnon neither good nor evil: for
Absalom hated Amnon because he had ravished his sister
Thamar.</span></li>
<li><span>And it came to pass after two years, that the sheep of
Absalom were shorn in Baalhasor, which is near Ephraim: and Absalom
invited all the king's sons:</span></li>
<li><span>And he came to the king, and said to him: Behold thy
servant's sheep are shorn. Let the king, I pray, with his servants
come to his servant.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said to Absalom: Nay, my son, do not ask
that we should all come, and be chargeable to thee. And when he
pressed him, and he would not go, he blessed him.</span></li>
<li><span>And Absalom said: If thou wilt not come, at least let my
brother Amnon, I beseech thee, come with us. And the king said to
him: It is not necessary that he should go with thee.</span></li>
<li><span>But Absalom pressed him, so that he let Amnon and all the
king's sons go with him. And Absalom made a feast as it were the
feast of a king.</span></li>
<li><span>And Absalom had commanded his servants, saying: Take
notice when Amnon shall be drunk with wine, and when I shall say to
you: Strike him, and kill him, fear not: for it is I that command
you: take courage, and be valiant men.</span></li>
<li><span>And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had
commanded them. And all the king's sons arose and got up every man
upon his mule, and fled.</span></li>
<li><span>And while they were yet in the way, a rumour came to
David, saying: Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is
not one of them left.</span></li>
<li><span>Then the king rose up, and rent his garments: and fell
upon the ground, and all his servants, that stood about him, rent
their garments.</span></li>
<li><span>But Jonadab the son of Semmaa David's brother answering,
said: Let not my lord the king think that all the king's sons are
slain: Amnon only is dead, for he was appointed by the mouth of
Absalom from the day that he ravished his sister
Thamar.</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore let not my lord the king take this thing
into his heart, saying: All the king's sons are slain: for Amnon
only is dead.</span></li>
<li><span>But Absalom fled away: and the young man that kept the
watch, lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold there came much
people by a by-way on the side of the mountain.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jonadab said to the king: Behold the king's sons are
come: as thy servant said, so it is.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he made an end of speaking, the king's sons also
appeared: and coming in they lifted up their voice, and wept: and
the king also and all his servants wept very much.</span></li>
<li><span>But Absalom fled, and went to Tholomai the son of Ammiud
the king of Gessur. And David mourned for his son every
day.</span></li>
<li><span>And Absalom after he was fled, and come into Gessur, was
there three years. And king David ceased to pursue after Absalom,
because he was comforted concerning the death of Amnon.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="14">2 Samuel 14</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And Joab the son of Sarvia, understanding that the king's
heart was turned to Absalom,</span></li>
<li><span>Sent to Thecua, and fetched from thence a wise woman: and
said to her: Feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on mourning
apparel, and be not anointed with oil, that thou mayest be as a
woman that had a long time been mourning for one dead.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt go in to the king, and shalt speak to him
in this manner. And Joab put the words in her mouth.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the woman of Thecua was come in to the king, she
fell before him upon the ground, and worshipped, and said: Save me,
O king.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said to her: What is the matter with thee?
She answered: Alas, I am a widow woman: for my husband is
dead.</span></li>
<li><span>And thy handmaid had two sons: and they quarrelled with
each other in the field, and there was none to part them: and the
one struck the other, and slew him.</span></li>
<li><span>And behold the whole kindred rising against thy handmaid,
saith: Deliver him that hath slain his brother, that we may kill
him for the life of his brother, whom he slew, and that we may
destroy the heir: and they seek to quench my spark which is left,
and will leave my husband no name, nor remainder upon the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said to the woman: Go to thy house, and I
will give charge concerning thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And the woman of Thecua said to the king: Upon me, my
lord, be the iniquity, and upon the house of my father: but may the
king and his throne be guiltless.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said: If any one shall say ought against
thee, bring him to me, and be shall not touch thee any
more.</span></li>
<li><span>And she said: Let the king remember the Lord his God,
that the next of kin be not multiplied to take revenge, and that
they may not kill my son. And he said: As the Lord liveth, there
shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>Then the woman said: Let thy handmaid speak one word to
my lord the king. And he said: Speak.</span></li>
<li><span>And the woman said: Why hast thou thought such a thing
against the people of God, and why hath the king spoken this word,
to sin, and not bring home again his own exile?</span></li>
<li><span>We all die, and like waters that return no more, we fall
down into the earth: neither will God have a soul to perish, but
recalleth, meaning that he that is cast off should not altogether
perish.</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore I am come, to speak this word to my lord
the king before the people. And thy handmaid said: I will speak to
the king, it maybe the king will perform the request of his
handmaid.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king hath hearkened to me to deliver his handmaid
out of the hand of all that would destroy me and my son together
out of the inheritance of God.</span></li>
<li><span>Then let thy handmaid say, that the word of the Lord the
king be made as a sacrifice. For even as an angel of God, so is my
lord the king, that he is neither moved with blessing nor cursing:
wherefore the Lord thy God is also with thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king answering, said to the woman: Hide not from
me the thing that I ask thee. And the woman said to him: Speak, my
lord the king.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said: Is not the hand of Joab with thee in
all this? The woman answered, and said: By the health of thy soul,
my lord, O king, it is neither on the left hand, nor on the right,
in all these things which my lord the king hath spoken: for thy
servant Joab, he commanded me, and he put all these words into the
mouth of thy handmaid.</span></li>
<li><span>That I should come about with this form of speech, thy
servant Joab, commanded this: but thou, my lord, O king, art wise,
according to the wisdom of ail angel of God, to understand all
things upon earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said to Joab: Behold I am appeased and have
granted thy request: Go therefore and fetch back the boy
Absalom.</span></li>
<li><span>And Joab falling down to the ground upon his face,
adored, and blessed the king: and Joab said: This day thy servant
hath understood, that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O
king: for thou hast fulfilled the request of thy
servant.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Joab arose and went to Gessur, and brought Absalom
to Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>But the king said: Let him return into his house, and let
him not see my face. So Absalom returned into his house, and saw
not the king's face.</span></li>
<li><span>But in all Israel there was not a man so comely, and so
exceedingly beautiful as Absalom: from the sole of the foot to the
crown of his head there was no blemish in him.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he polled his hair (now he was polled once a
year, because his hair was burdensome to him) he weighed the hair
of his head at two hundred sicles, according to the common
weight.</span></li>
<li><span>And there were born to Absalom three sons: and one
daughter, whose, name was Thamar, and she was very
beautiful.</span></li>
<li><span>And Absalom dwelt two years in Jerusalem, and saw not the
king's face.</span></li>
<li><span>He sent therefore to Joab, to send him to the king: but
he would not come to him. And when he had sent the second time, and
he would not come to him,</span></li>
<li><span>He said to his servants: You know the field of Joab near
my field, that hath a crop of barley: go now and set it on fire. So
the servants of Absalom set the corn on fire. And Joab's servants
coming with their garments rent, said: The servants of Absalom have
set part of the field on fire.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom to his house, and
said: Why have thy servants set my corn on fire?</span></li>
<li><span>And Absalom answered Joab: I sent to thee beseeching thee
to come to me, that I might send thee to the king, to say to him:
Wherefore am I come from Gessur? it had been better for me to be
there: I beseech thee therefore that I may see the face of the
king: and if he be mindful of my iniquity, let him kill
me.</span></li>
<li><span>So Joab going in to the king, told him all: and Absalom
was called for, and he went in to the king: and prostrated himself
on the ground before him: and the king kissed Absalom.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="15">2 Samuel 15</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Now after these things Absalom made himself chariots, and
horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.</span></li>
<li><span>And Absalom rising up early stood by the entrance of the
gate, and when any man had business to come to the king's judgment,
Absalom called him to him, and said: Of what city art thou? He
answered, and said: Thy servant is of such a tribe of
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And Absalom answered him: Thy words seem to me good and
just. But there is no man appointed by the king to hear thee. And
Absalom said:</span></li>
<li><span>O that they would make me judge over the land, that all
that have business might come to me, that I might do them
justice.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover when any man came to him to salute him, he put
forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.</span></li>
<li><span>And this he did to all Israel that came for judgment, to
be heard by the king, and he enticed the hearts of the men of
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And after forty years, Absalom said to king David: Let me
go, and pay my vows which I have vowed to the Lord in
Hebron.</span></li>
<li><span>For thy servant made avow, when he was in Gessur of
Syria, saying: If the Lord shall bring me again into Jerusalem I
will offer sacrifice to the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And king David said to him: Go in peace. And he arose,
and went to Hebron.</span></li>
<li><span>And Absalom sent spies into all the tribes of Israel,
saying: As soon as you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, say ye:
Absalom reigneth in Hebron.</span></li>
<li><span>Now there went with Absalom two hundred men out of
Jerusalem that were called, going with simplicity of heart, and
knowing nothing of the design.</span></li>
<li><span>Absalom also sent for Achitophel the Gilonite, David's
counsellor, from his city Gilo. And while he was offering
sacrifices, there was a strong conspiracy, and the people running
together increased with Absalom.</span></li>
<li><span>And there came a messenger to David, saying: All Israel
with their whole heart followeth Absalom.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to his servants, that were with him in
Jerusalem: Arise and let us flee: for we shall not escape else from
the face of Absalom: make haste to go out, lest he come and
overtake us, and bring ruin upon us, and smite the city with the
edge of the sword.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king's servants said to him: Whatsoever our lord
the king shall command, we thy servants will willingly
execute.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king went forth, and all his household on foot:
and the king left ten women his concubines to keep the
house:</span></li>
<li><span>And the king going forth and all Israel on foot, stood
afar off from the house:</span></li>
<li><span>And all his servants walked by him, and the bands of the
Cerethi, and the Phelethi, and all the Gethites, valiant warriors,
six hundred men who had followed him from Geth on foot, went before
the king.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said to Ethai the Gethite: Why comest thou
with us? return and dwell with the king, for thou art a stranger,
and art come out of thy own place.</span></li>
<li><span>Yesterday thou camest, and to day shalt thou be forced to
go forth with us? but I shall go whither I am going: return thou,
and take back thy brethren with thee, and the Lord will shew thee
mercy, and truth, because thou hast shewn grace and
fidelity.</span></li>
<li><span>And Ethai answered the king, saying: As the Lord liveth,
and as my lord the king liveth: in what place soever thou shalt be,
my lord, O king, either in death, or in life, there will thy
servant be.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to Ethai: Come, and pass over. And Ethai
the Gethite passed, and all the men that were with him, and the
rest of the people.</span></li>
<li><span>And they all wept with a loud voice, and all the people
passed over: the king also himself went over the brook Cedron, and
all the people marched towards the way that looketh to the
desert.</span></li>
<li><span>And Sadoc the priest also came, and all the Levites with
him carrying the ark of the covenant of God, and they set down the
ark of God: and Abiathar went up, till all the people that was come
out of the city had done passing.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said to Sadoc: Carry back the ark of God
into the city: if I shall find grace in the sight of the Lord, he
will bring me again, and he will shew me it, and his
tabernacle.</span></li>
<li><span>But if he shall say to me: Thou pleasest me not: I am
ready, let him do that which is good before him.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said to Sadoc the priest: O seer, return
into the city in peace: and let Achimaas thy son, and Jonathan the
son of Abiathar, your two sons, be with you.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I will lie hid in the plains of the wilderness,
till there come word from you to certify me.</span></li>
<li><span>So Sadoc and Abiathar carried back the ark of God into
Jerusalem: and they tarried there.</span></li>
<li><span>But David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, going up
and weeping, walking barefoot, and with his head covered, and all
the people that were with them, went up with their heads covered
weeping.</span></li>
<li><span>And it was told David that Achitophel also was in the
conspiracy with Absalom, and David said: Infatuate, O Lord, I
beseech thee, the counsel of Achitophel.</span></li>
<li><span>And when David was come to the top of the mountain, where
he was about to adore the Lord, behold Chusai the Arachite, came to
meet him with his garment rent and his head covered with
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to him: If thou come with me, thou wilt be
a burden to me:</span></li>
<li><span>But if thou return into the city, and wilt say to
Absalom: I am thy servant, O king: as I have been thy father's
servant, so I will be thy servant: thou shalt defeat the counsel of
Achitophel.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou hast with thee Sadoc, and Abiathar the priests:
and what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou
shalt tell it to Sadoc and Abiathar the priests.</span></li>
<li><span>And there are with them their two sons Achimaas the son
of Sadoc, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar: and you shall send by
them to me every thing that you shall hear.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Chusai the friend of David went into the city, and
Absalom came into Jerusalem.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="16">2 Samuel 16</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And when David was a little past the top of the hill,
behold Siba the servant of Miphiboseth came to meet him with two
asses, laden with two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred
bunches of raisins, a hundred cakes of figs, and a vessel of
wine.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said to Siba: What mean these things? And
Siba answered: The asses are for the king's household to sit on:
and the loaves and the figs for thy servants to eat, and the wine
to drink if any man be faint in the desert.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said: Where is thy master's son? And Siba
answered the king: He remained in Jerusalem, saying: To day will
the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my
father.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said to Siba: I give thee all that belonged
to Miphiboseth. And Siba said: I beseech thee let me find grace
before thee, my lord, O king.</span></li>
<li><span>And king David came as far as Bahurim: and behold there
came out from thence a man of the kindred of the house of Saul
named Semei, the son of Gera, and coming out he cursed as he went
on,</span></li>
<li><span>And he threw stones at David, and at all the servants of
king David: and all the people, and all the warriors walked on the
right, and on the left side of the king.</span></li>
<li><span>And thus said Semei when he cursed the king: Come out,
come out, thou man of blood, and thou man of Belial.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord hath repaid thee for all the blood of the house
of Saul: because thou hast usurped the kingdom in his stead, and
the Lord hath given the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son:
and behold thy evils press upon thee, because thou art a man of
blood.</span></li>
<li><span>And Abisai the son of Sarvia said to the king: Why should
this dead dog curse my lord the king? I will go, and cut off his
head.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said: What have I to do with you, ye sons of
Sarvia? Let him alone and let him curse: for the Lord hath bid him
curse David: and who is he that shall dare say, why hath he done
so?</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said to Abisai, and to all his servants:
Behold my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeketh my life: how
much more now a son of Jemini? let him alone that he may curse as
the Lord hath bidden him.</span></li>
<li><span>Perhaps the Lord may look upon my affliction, and the
Lord may render me good for the cursing of this day.</span></li>
<li><span>And David and his men with him went by the way. And Semei
by the hill's side went over against him, cursing, and casting
stones at him, and scattering earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king and all the people with him came weary, and
refreshed themselves there.</span></li>
<li><span>But Absalom and all his people came into Jerusalem, and
Achitophel was with him.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Chusai the Arachite, David's friend, was come to
Absalom, he said to him: God save thee, O king, God save thee, O
king.</span></li>
<li><span>And Absalom said to him: Is this thy kindness to thy
friend? Why wentest thou not with thy friend?</span></li>
<li><span>And Chusai answered Absalom: Nay: for I will be his, whom
the Lord hath chosen, and all this people, and all Israel, and with
him will I abide.</span></li>
<li><span>Besides this, whom shall I serve? is it not the king's
son? as I have served thy father, so will I serve thee
also.</span></li>
<li><span>And Absalom said to Achitophel: Consult what we are to
do.</span></li>
<li><span>And Achitophel said to Absalom: Go in to the concubines
of thy father, whom he hath left to keep the house: that when all
Israel shall hear that thou hast disgraced thy father, their hands
may be strengthened with thee.</span></li>
<li><span>So they spread a tent for Absalom on the top of the
house, and he went in to his father's concubines before all
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the counsel of Achitophel, which he gave in those
days, was as if a man should consult God: so was all the counsel of
Achitophel, both when he was with David, and when he was with
Absalom.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="17">2 Samuel 17</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And Achitophel said to Absalom: I will choose me twelve
thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this
night.</span></li>
<li><span>And coming upon him (for he is now weary, and weak
handed) I will defeat him: and when all the people is put to flight
that is with him, I will kill the king who will be left
alone.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will bring back all the people, as if they were but
one man: for thou seekest but one man: and all the people shall be
in peace.</span></li>
<li><span>And his saying pleased Absalom, and all the ancients of
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>But Absalom said: Call Chusai the Arachite, and let us
hear what he also saith.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Chusai was come to Absalom, Absalom said to him:
Achitophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do it or not?
what counsel dost thou give?</span></li>
<li><span>And Chusai said to Absalom: The counsel that Achitophel
hath given this time is not good.</span></li>
<li><span>And again Chusai said: Thou knowest thy father, and the
men that are with him, that they are very valiant, and bitter in
their mind, as a bear raging in the wood when her whelps are taken
away: and thy father is a warrior, and will not lodge with the
people.</span></li>
<li><span>Perhaps he now lieth hid in pits, or in some other place
where he list: and when any one shall fall at the first, every one
that heareth it shall say: There is a slaughter among the people
that followed Absalom.</span></li>
<li><span>And the most valiant man whose heart is as the heart of a
lion, shall melt for fear: for all the people of Israel know thy
father to be a valiant man, and that all who are with him are
valiant.</span></li>
<li><span>But this seemeth to me to be good counsel: Let all Israel
be gathered to thee, from Dan to Bersabee, as the sand of the sea
which cannot be numbered: and thou shalt be in the midst of
them.</span></li>
<li><span>And we shall come upon him in what place soever he shall
be found: and we shall cover him, as the dew falleth upon the
ground, and we shall not leave of the men that are with him, not so
much as one.</span></li>
<li><span>And if he shall enter into any city, all Israel shall
cast ropes round about that city, and we will draw it into the
river, so that there shall not be found so much as one small stone
thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>And Absalom, and all the men of Israel said: The counsel
of Chusai the Arachite is better than the counsel of Achitophel:
and by the will of the Lord the profitable counsel of Achitophel
was defeated, that the Lord might bring evil upon
Absalom.</span></li>
<li><span>And Chusai said to Sadoc and Abiathar the priests: Thus
and thus did Achitophel counsel Absalom, and the ancients of
Israel: and thus and thus did I counsel them.</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying: Tarry
not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but without delay
pass over: lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that
is with him.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jonathan and Achimaas stayed by the fountain Rogel:
and there went a maid and told them: and they went forward, to
carry the message to king David, for they might not be seen, nor
enter into the city.</span></li>
<li><span>But a certain boy saw them, and told Absalom: but they
making haste went into the house of a certain man in Bahurim, who
had a well in his court, and they went down into it.</span></li>
<li><span>And a woman took, and spread a covering over the mouth of
the well, as it were to dry sodden barley: and so the thing was not
known.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Absalom's servants were come into the house,
they said to the woman: Where is Achimaas and Jonathan? and the
woman answered them: They passed on in haste, after they had tasted
a little water. But they that sought them, when they found them
not, returned into Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they were gone, they came up out of the well,
and going on told king David, and said: Arise, and pass quickly
over the river: for this manner of counsel has Achitophel given
against you.</span></li>
<li><span>So David arose, and all the people that were with him,
and they passed over the Jordan, until it grew light, and not one
of them was left that was not gone over the river.</span></li>
<li><span>But Achitophel seeing that his counsel was not followed,
saddled his ass, and arose and went home to his house and to his
city, and putting his house in order, hanged himself, and was
buried in the sepulchre of his father.</span></li>
<li><span>But David came to the camp, and Absalom passed over the
Jordan, be and all the men of Israel with him.</span></li>
<li><span>Now Absalom appointed Amasa in Joab's stead over the
army: and Amasa was the son of a man who was called Jethra of
Jezrael, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Naas, the sister of
Sarvia who was the mother of Joab.</span></li>
<li><span>And Israel camped with Absalom in the land of
Galaad.</span></li>
<li><span>And when David was come to the camp, Sobi the son of Naas
of Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammihel
of Lodabar, and Berzellai the Galaadite of Rogelim,</span></li>
<li><span>Brought him beds, and tapestry, and earthen vessels, and
wheat, and barley, and meal, and parched corn, and beans, and
lentils, and fried pulse,</span></li>
<li><span>And honey, and butter, and sheep, and fat calves, and
they gave to David and the people that were with him, to eat: for
they suspected that the people were faint with hunger and thirst in
the wilderness.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="18">2 Samuel 18</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And David having reviewed his people, appointed over them
captains of thousands and of hundreds,</span></li>
<li><span>And sent forth a third part of the people under the hand
of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abisai the son of
Sarvia Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ethai,
who was of Geth: and the king said to the people: I also will go
forth with you.</span></li>
<li><span>And the people answered: Thou shalt not go forth: for if
we flee away, they will not much mind us: or if half of us should
fall, they will not greatly care: for thou alone art accounted for
ten thousand: it is better therefore that thou shouldst be in the
city to succour us.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said to them: What seemeth good to you, that
will I do. And the king stood by the gate: and all the people went
forth by their troops, by hundreds and by thousands.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king commanded Joab, and Abisai, and Ethai,
saying: Save me the boy Absalom. And all the people heard the king
giving charge to all the princes concerning Absalom.</span></li>
<li><span>So the people went out into the field against Israel and
the battle was fought in the forest of Ephraim.</span></li>
<li><span>And the people of Israel were defeated there by David's
army, and a great slaughter was made that day of twenty thousand
men.</span></li>
<li><span>And the battle there was scattered over the face of all
the country, and there were many more of the people whom the forest
consumed, than whom the sword devoured that day.</span></li>
<li><span>And it happened that Absalom met he servants of David,
riding on a mule: and as the mule went under a thick and large oak,
his head stuck in the oak: and while he hung between the heaven and
he earth, the mule on which he rode passed on.</span></li>
<li><span>And one saw this and told Joab, saying: I saw Absalom
hanging upon an oak.</span></li>
<li><span>And Joab said to the man that told him: If thou sawest
him, why didst thou not stab him to the ground, and I would have
given thee ten sicles of silver, and belt?</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to Joab: If thou wouldst have paid down in my
hands a thousand pieces of silver, I would not lay my hands upon
the king's son: for in our hearing he king charged thee, and
Abisai, and Ethai, saying: Save me the boy Absalom.</span></li>
<li><span>Yea and if I should have acted boldly against my own
life, this could not have been hid from the king, and wouldst thou
have stood by me?</span></li>
<li><span>And Joab said: Not as thou wilt, but will set upon him in
thy sight. So he took three lances in his hand, and thrust them
into the heart of Absalom: and whilst he yet panted for life,
sticking on the oak,</span></li>
<li><span>Ten young men, armourbearers of Joab, ran up, and
striking him slew him.</span></li>
<li><span>And Joab sounded the trumpet, and kept back the people
from pursuing after Israel in their flight, being willing to spare
he multitude.</span></li>
<li><span>And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in
the forest, and they laid an exceeding great heap of stories upon
him: but all Israel fled to their own dwellings.</span></li>
<li><span>Now Absalom had reared up for himself, in his lifetime, a
pillar, which is in the king's valley: for he said: I have no son,
and this shall be the monument of my name. And he called the pillar
by is own name, and it is called the hand of Absalom, to this
day.</span></li>
<li><span>And Achimaas the son of Sadoc said: I will run and tell
the king, that the Lord hath done judgment for him from the hand of
his enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>And Joab said to him: Thou shalt not be the messenger
this day, but shalt bear tidings another day: this day I will not
have thee bear tidings, because the king's son is dead.</span></li>
<li><span>And Joab said to Chusai: Go, and tell the king what thou
hast seen. Chusai bowed down to Joab, and ran.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Achimaas the son of Sadoc said to Joab again: Why
might not I also run after Chusai? And Joab said to him: Why wilt
thou run, my son? thou wilt not be the bearer of good
tidings.</span></li>
<li><span>He answered: But what if I run? And he said to him: Run.
Then Achimaas running by a nearer way passed Chusai.</span></li>
<li><span>And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman
that was on the top of the gate upon the wall, lifting up his eyes,
saw a man running alone.</span></li>
<li><span>And crying out he told the king: and the king said: If he
be alone, there are good tidings in his mouth. And as he was coming
apace, and drawing nearer,</span></li>
<li><span>The watchman saw another man running, and crying aloud
from above, he said: I see another man running alone. And the king
said: He also is a good messenger.</span></li>
<li><span>And the watchman said: The running of the foremost
seemeth to me like the running of Achimaas the son of Sadoc. And
the king said: He is a good man: and cometh with good
news.</span></li>
<li><span>And Achimaas crying out, said to the king: God save thee,
O king. And falling down before the king with his face to the
ground, he said: Blessed be the Lord thy God, who hath shut up the
men that have lifted up their hands against the lord my
king.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said: Is the young man Absalom safe? And
Achimaas said: I saw a great tumult, O king, when thy servant Joab
sent me thy servant: I know nothing else.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said to him: Pass, and stand
here.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he bad passed, and stood still, Chusai appeared:
and coming up he said: I bring good tidings, my lord, the king, for
the Lord hath judged for thee this day from the hand of all that
have risen up against thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said to Chusai: Is the young man Absalom
safe? And Chusai answering him, said: Let the enemies of my lord,
the king, and all that rise against him unto evil, be as the young
man is.</span></li>
<li><span>The king therefore being much moved, went up to the high
chamber over the gate, and wept. And as he went he spoke in this
manner: My son Absalom, Absalom my son: would to God that I might
die for thee, Absalom my son, my son Absalom.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="19">2 Samuel 19</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And it was told Joab, that the king wept and mourned for
his son:</span></li>
<li><span>And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto
all the people: for the people heard say that day: The king
grieveth for his son.</span></li>
<li><span>And the people shunned the going into the city that day
as a people would do that hath turned their backs, and fled away
from the battle.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king covered his head, and cried with a loud
voice: O my son Absalom, O Absalom my son, O my son.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Joab going into the house to the king, said: Thou
hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, that have saved
thy life, and the lives of thy sons, and of thy daughters, and the
lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou lovest them that hate thee, and thou hatest them
that love thee: and thou hast shewn this day that thou carest not
for thy nobles, nor for thy servants: and I now plainly perceive
that if Absalom had lived, and all we had been slain, then it would
have pleased thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore arise, and go out, and speak to the
satisfaction of thy servants: for I swear to thee by the Lord, that
if thou wilt not go forth, there will not tarry with thee so much
as one this night: and that will be worse to thee, than all the
evils that have befallen thee from thy youth until now.</span></li>
<li><span>Then the king arose and sat in the gate: and it was told
to all the people that the king sat in the gate: and all the people
came before the king, but Israel fled to their own
dwellings.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the people were at strife in all the tribes of
Israel, saying: The king delivered us out of the hand of our
enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines: and
now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.</span></li>
<li><span>But Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in the
battle: how long are you silent, and bring not back the
king?</span></li>
<li><span>And king David sent to Sadoc, and Abiathar the priests,
saying: Speak to the ancients of Juda, saying: Why are you the last
to bring the king back to his house? (For the talk of all Israel
was come to the king in his house.)</span></li>
<li><span>You are my brethren, you are my bone, and my flesh, why
are you the last to bring back the king?</span></li>
<li><span>And say ye to Amasa: Art not thou my bone, and my flesh?
So do God to me and add more, if thou be not the chief captain of
the army before me always in the place of Joab.</span></li>
<li><span>And be inclined the heart of all the men of Juda, as it
were of one man: and they sent to the king, saying: Return thou,
and all thy servants.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king returned and came as far as the Jordan, and
all Juda came as far as Galgal to meet the king, and to bring him
over the Jordan.</span></li>
<li><span>And Semei the son of Gera the son of Jemini of Bahurim,
made haste and went down with the men of Juda to meet king
David,</span></li>
<li><span>With a thousand men of Benjamin, and Siba the servant of
the house of Saul: and his fifteen sons, and twenty servants were
with him: and going over the Jordan,</span></li>
<li><span>They passed the fords before the king, that they might
help over the king's household, and do according to his
commandment. And Semei the son of Gera falling down before the
king, when he was come over the Jordan,</span></li>
<li><span>Said to him: Impute not to me, my lord, the iniquity, nor
remember the injuries of thy servant on the day that thou, my lord,
the king, wentest out of Jerusalem, nor lay it up in thy heart, O
king.</span></li>
<li><span>For I thy servant acknowledge my sin: and therefore I am
come this day the first of all the house of Joseph, and am come
down to meet my lord the king.</span></li>
<li><span>But Abisai the son of Sarvia answering, said: Shall Semei
for these words not be put to death, because he cursed the Lord's
anointed?</span></li>
<li><span>And David said: What have I to do with you, ye sons of
Sarvia? why are you a satan this day to me? shall there any man be
killed this day in Israel? do not I know that this day I am made
king over Israel?</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said to Semei: Thou shalt not die. And he
swore unto him.</span></li>
<li><span>And Miphiboseth the son of Saul came down to meet the
king, and he had neither washed his feet, nor trimmed his beard:
nor washed his garments from the day that the king went out, until
the day of his return in peace.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he met the king at Jerusalem, the king said to
him: Why camest thou not with me, Miphiboseth?</span></li>
<li><span>And he answering, said: My lord, O king, my servant
despised me: for I thy servant spoke to him to saddle me an ass,
that I might get on and go with the king: for I thy servant am
lame.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover he hath also accused me thy servant to thee, my
lord the king: but thou my lord the king art as an angel of God, do
what pleaseth thee.</span></li>
<li><span>For all of my father's house were no better than worthy
of death before my lord the king; and thou hast set me thy servant
among the guests of thy table: what just complaint therefore have
I? or what right to cry any more to the king?</span></li>
<li><span>Then the king said to him: Why speakest thou any more?
what I have said is determined: thou and Siba divide the
possessions.</span></li>
<li><span>And Miphiboseth answered the king: Yea, let him take all,
for as much as my lord the king is returned peaceably into his
house.</span></li>
<li><span>Berzellai also the Galaadite coming down from Rogelim,
brought the king over the Jordan, being ready also to wait on him
beyond the river.</span></li>
<li><span>Now Berzellai the Galaadite was of a great age, that is
to say, fourscore years old, and he provided the king with
sustenance when he abode in the camp: for he was a man exceeding
rich.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said to Berzellai: Come with me that thou
mayest rest secure with me in Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And Berzellai said to the king: How many are the days of
the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to
Jerusalem?</span></li>
<li><span>I am this day fourscore years old, are my senses quick to
discern sweet and bitter? or can meat or drink delight thy servant?
or can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women?
why should thy servant be a burden to my lord, the
king?</span></li>
<li><span>I thy servant will go on a little way from the Jordan
with thee: I need not this recompense.</span></li>
<li><span>But I beseech thee let thy servant return, and die in my
own city, and be buried by the sepulchre of my father, and of my
mother. But there is thy servant Chamaam, let him go with thee, my
lord, the king, and do to him whatsoever seemeth good to
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Then the king said to him: Let Chamaam go over with me,
and I will do for him whatsoever shall please thee, and all that
thou shalt ask of me, thou shalt obtain.</span></li>
<li><span>And when all the people and the king had passed over the
Jordan, the king kissed Berzellai, and blessed him: and he returned
to his own place.</span></li>
<li><span>So the king went on to Galgal, and Chamaam with him. Now
all the people of Juda had brought the king over, and only half of
the people of Israel were there.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore all the men of Israel running together to the
king, said to him: Why have our brethren the men of Juda stolen
thee away, and have brought the king and his household over the
Jordan, and all the men of David with him?</span></li>
<li><span>And all the men of Juda answered the men of Israel:
Because the king is nearer to me: why art thou angry for this
matter? have we eaten any thing of the king's, or have any gifts
been given us?</span></li>
<li><span>And the men of Israel answered the men of Juda, and said:
I have ten parts in the king more than thou, and David belongeth to
me more than to thee: why hast thou done me a wrong, and why was it
not told me first, that I might bring back my king? And the men of
Juda answered more harshly than the men of Israel.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="20">2 Samuel 20</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose
name was Seba, the son of Bochri, a man of Jemini: and he sounded
the trumpet, and said: We have no part in David, nor inheritance in
the son of Isai: return to thy dwellings, O Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And all Israel departed from David, and followed Seba the
son of Bochri: but the men of Juda stuck to their king from the
Jordan unto Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the king was come into his house at Jerusalem,
he took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the
house, and put them in ward, allowing them provisions: and he went
not in unto them, but they were shut up unto the day of their death
living in widowhood.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said to Amasa: Assemble to me all the men of
Juda against the third day, and be thou here present.</span></li>
<li><span>So Amasa went to assemble the men of Juda, but he tarried
beyond the set time which the king had appointed him.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to Abisai: Now will Seba the son of Bochri
do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou therefore the servants
of thy lord, and pursue after him, lest he find fenced cities, and
escape us.</span></li>
<li><span>So Joab's men went out with him, and the Cerethi and the
Phelethi: and all the valiant men went out of Jerusalem to pursue
after Seba the son of Bochri.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they were at the great stone which is in Gabaon,
Amasa coming met them. And Joab had on a close coat of equal length
with his habit, and over it was girded with a sword hanging down to
his flank, in a scabbard, made in such manner as to come out with
the least motion and strike.</span></li>
<li><span>And Joab said to Amasa: God save thee, my brother. And he
took Amasa by the chin with his right hand to kiss him.</span></li>
<li><span>But Amasa did not take notice of the sword, which Joab
had, and he struck him in the side, and shed out his bowels to the
ground, and gave him not a second wound, and he died. And Joab, and
Abisai his brother pursued after Seba the son of
Bochri.</span></li>
<li><span>In the mean time some men of Joab's company stopping at
the dead body of Amasa, said: Behold he that would have been in
Joab's stead the companion of David.</span></li>
<li><span>And Amasa imbrued with blood, lay in the midst of the
way. A certain man saw this that all the people stood still to look
upon him, so he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field,
and covered him with a garment, that they who passed might not stop
on his account.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he was removed out of the way, all the people
went on following Joab to pursue after Seba the son of
Bochri.</span></li>
<li><span>Now he had passed through all the tribes of Israel unto
Abela and Bethmaacha: and all the chosen men were gathered together
unto him.</span></li>
<li><span>And they came, and besieged him in Abela, and in
Bethmaacha, and they cast up works round the city, and the city was
besieged: and all the people that were with Joab, laboured to throw
down the walls.</span></li>
<li><span>And a wise woman cried out from the city: Hear, hear, and
say to Joab: Come near hither, and I will speak with
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he was come near to her, she said to him: Art
thou Joab? And he answered: I am. And she spoke thus to him: Hear
the words of thy handmaid. He answered: I do hear.</span></li>
<li><span>And she again said: A saying was used in the old proverb:
They that inquire, let them inquire in Abela: and so they made an
end.</span></li>
<li><span>Am not I she that answer truth in Israel, and thou
seekest to destroy the city, and to overthrow a mother in Israel?
Why wilt thou throw down the inheritance of the Lord?</span></li>
<li><span>And Joab answering said: God forbid, God forbid that I
should, I do not throw down, nor destroy.</span></li>
<li><span>The matter is not so, but a man of mount Ephraim, Seba
the son of Bochri by name, hath lifted up his hand against king
David: deliver him only, and we will depart from the city. And the
woman said to Joab: Behold his head shall be thrown to thee from
the wall.</span></li>
<li><span>So she went to all the people, and spoke to them wisely:
and they cut off the head of Seba the son of Bochri, and cast it
out to Joab. And he sounded the trumpet, and they departed from the
city, every one to their home: and Joab returned to Jerusalem to
the king.</span></li>
<li><span>So Joab was over all the army of Israel: and Banaias the
son of Joiada was over the Cerethites and Phelethites,</span></li>
<li><span>But Aduram over the tributes: and Josaphat the son of
Ahilud was recorder.</span></li>
<li><span>And Siva was scribe: and Sadoc and Abiathar,
priests.</span></li>
<li><span>And Ira the Jairite was the priest of David.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="21">2 Samuel 21</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And there was a famine in the days of David for three
years successively: and David consulted the oracle of the Lord. And
the Lord said: It is for Saul, and his bloody house, because he
slew the Gabaonites.</span></li>
<li><span>Then the king, calling for the Gabaonites, said to them:
(Now the Gabaonites were not of the children of Israel, but the
remains of the Amorrhites: I and the children of Israel had sworn
to them, and Saul sought to slay them out of zeal, as it were for
the children of Israel and Juda:)</span></li>
<li><span>David therefore said to the Gabaonites: What shall I do
for you? and what shall be the atonement for you, that you may
bless the inheritance of the Lord?</span></li>
<li><span>And the Gabaonites said to him: We have no contest about
silver and gold, but against Saul and against his house: neither do
we desire that any man be slain of Israel. And the king said to
them: What will you then that I should do for you?</span></li>
<li><span>And they said to the king: The man that crushed us and
oppressed us unjustly, we must destroy in such manner that there be
not so much as one left of his stock in all the coasts of
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Let seven men of his children be delivered unto us, that
we may crucify them to the Lord in Gabaa of Saul, once the chosen
of the Lord. And the king said: I will give them.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king spared Miphiboseth the son of Jonathan the
son of Saul, because of the oath of the Lord, that had been between
David and Jonathan the son of Saul.</span></li>
<li><span>So the king took the two sons of Respha the daughter of
Aia, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni, and Miphiboseth: and the five
sons of Michol the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Hadriel the
son of Berzellai, that was of Molathi:</span></li>
<li><span>And gave them into the hands of the Gabaonites: and they
crucified them on a hill before the Lord: and these seven died
together in the first days of the harvest, when the barley began to
be reaped.</span></li>
<li><span>And Respha the daughter of Aia took haircloth, and spread
it under her upon the rock from the beginning of the harvest, till
water dropped upon them out of heaven: and suffered neither the
birds to tear them by day, nor the beasts by night.</span></li>
<li><span>And it was told David, what Respha the daughter of Aia,
the concubine of Saul, had done.</span></li>
<li><span>And David went, and took the bones of Saul, and the bones
of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabes Galaad, who had stolen
them from the street of Bethsan, where the Philistines had hanged
them when they had slain Saul in Gelboe.</span></li>
<li><span>And he brought from thence the bones of Saul, and the
bones of Jonathan his son, and they gathered up the bones of them
that were crucified,</span></li>
<li><span>And they buried them with the bones of Saul, and of
Jonathan his son in the land of Benjamin, in the side, in the
sepulchre of Cis his father: and they did all that the king had
commanded, and God shewed mercy again to the land after these
things.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Philistines made war again against Israel, and
David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the
Philistines. And David growing faint,</span></li>
<li><span>Jesbibenob, who was of the race of Arapha, the iron of
whose spear weighed three hundred ounces, being girded with a new
sword, attempted to kill David.</span></li>
<li><span>And Abisai the son of Sarvia rescued him, and striking
the Philistine killed him. Then David's men swore unto him, saying:
Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, lest thou put out the
lamp of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>There was also a second battle in Gob against the
Philistines: then Sobochai of Husathi slew Saph of the race of
Arapha of the family of the giants.</span></li>
<li><span>And there was a third battle in Gob against the
Philistines, in which Adeodatus the son of the Forrest an
embroiderer of Bethlehem slew Goliath the Gethite, the shaft of
whose spear was like a weaver's beam.</span></li>
<li><span>A fourth battle was in Geth. where there was a man of
great stature, that had six fingers on each hand, and six toes on
each foot, four and twenty in all, and he was of the race of
Arapha.</span></li>
<li><span>And he reproached Israel: and Jonathan the son of Samae
the brother of David slew him.</span></li>
<li><span>These four were born of Arapha in Geth, and they fell by
the hand of David, and of his servants.</span></li>

<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="22">2 Samuel 22</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And David spoke to the Lord the words of this canticle,
in the day that the Lord delivered him out of the hand of all his
enemies, and out of the hand of Saul,</span></li>
<li><span>And he said: The Lord is my rock, and my strength, and my
saviour.</span></li>
<li><span>God is my strong one, in him will I trust: my shield, and
the horn of my salvation: he lifteth me up, and is my refuge: my
saviour, thou wilt deliver me from iniquity.</span></li>
<li><span>I will call on the Lord who is worthy to be praised: and
I shall be saved from my enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>For the pangs of death have sur rounded me: the floods of
Belial have made me afraid.</span></li>
<li><span>The cords of hell compassed me: the snares of death
prevented me.</span></li>
<li><span>In my distress I will call upon the Lord, and I will cry
to my God: and he will hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry
shall come to his ears.</span></li>
<li><span>The earth shook and trembled, the foundations of the
mountains were moved, and shaken, because he was angry with
them.</span></li>
<li><span>A smoke went up from his nostrils, and a devouring fire
out of his mouth: coals were kindled by it.</span></li>
<li><span>He bowed the heavens, and came down: and darkness was
under his feet.</span></li>
<li><span>And he rode upon the cherubims, and flew: and slid upon
the wings of the wind.</span></li>
<li><span>He made darkness a covering round about him: dropping
waters out of the clouds of the heavens.</span></li>
<li><span>By the brightness before him, the coals of fire were
kindled.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord shall thunder from heaven: and the most high
shall give forth his voice.</span></li>
<li><span>He shot arrows and scattered them: lightning, and
consumed them.</span></li>
<li><span>And the overflowings of the sea appeared, and the
foundations of the world were laid open at the rebuke of the Lord,
at the blast of the spirit of his wrath.</span></li>
<li><span>He sent from on high, and took me, and drew me out of
many waters.</span></li>
<li><span>He delivered me from my most mighty enemy, and from them
that hated me: for they were too strong for me.</span></li>
<li><span>He prevented me in the day of my affliction, and the Lord
became my stay.</span></li>
<li><span>And he brought me forth into a large place, he delivered
me, because I pleased him.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord will reward me according to my justice: and
according to the cleanness of my hands he will render to
me.</span></li>
<li><span>Because I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not
wickedly departed from my God.</span></li>
<li><span>For all his judgments are in my sight: and his precepts I
have not removed from me.</span></li>
<li><span>And I shall be perfect with him: and shall keep myself
from my iniquity.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord will recompense me according to my justice:
and according to the cleanness of my hands in the sight of his
eyes.</span></li>
<li><span>With the holy one thou wilt be holy: and with the valiant
perfect.</span></li>
<li><span>With the elect thou wilt be elect: and with the perverse
thou wilt be perverted.</span></li>
<li><span>And the poor people thou wilt save: and with thy eyes
thou wilt humble the haughty.</span></li>
<li><span>For thou art my lamp, O Lord: and thou, O Lord, wilt
enlighten my darkness.</span></li>
<li><span>For in thee I will run girded: in my God I will leap over
the wall.</span></li>
<li><span>God, his way is immaculate, the word of the Lord is tried
by fire: he is the shield of all that trust in him.</span></li>
<li><span>Who is God but the Lord: and who is strong but our
God?</span></li>
<li><span>God who hath girded me with strength, and made my way
perfect.</span></li>
<li><span>Making my feet like the feet of harts, and setting me
upon my high places.</span></li>
<li><span>He teacheth my bands to war: and maketh my arms like a
bow of brass.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast given me the shield of my salvation: and thy
mildness hath multiplied me.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt enlarge my steps under me: and my ankles shall
not fail.</span></li>
<li><span>I will pursue after my enemies, and crush them: and will
not return again till I consume them.</span></li>
<li><span>I will consume them and break them in pieces, so that
they shall not rise: they shall fall under my feet.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast girded me with strength to battle: thou hast
made them that resisted me to bow under me.</span></li>
<li><span>My enemies thou hast made to turn their back to me: them
that hated me, and I shall destroy them.</span></li>
<li><span>They shall cry, and there shall be none to save: to the
Lord, and he shall not hear them.</span></li>
<li><span>I shall beat them as small as the dust of the earth: I
shall crush them and spread them abroad like the mire of the
streets.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou wilt save me from the contradictions of my people:
thou wilt keep me to be the head of the Gentiles: the people which
I know not, shall serve me,</span></li>
<li><span>The sons of the stranger will resist me, at the hearing
of the ear they will obey me.</span></li>
<li><span>The strangers are melted away, and shall be straitened in
their distresses.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord liveth, and my God is blessed: and the strong
God of my salvation shall be exalted:</span></li>
<li><span>God who giveth me revenge, and bringest down people under
me,</span></li>
<li><span>Who bringest me forth from my enemies, and liftest me up
from them that resist me: from the wicked man thou shalt deliver
me.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore will I give thanks to thee. O Lord, among the
Gentiles, and will sing to thy name.</span></li>
<li><span>Giving great salvation to his king, and shewing mercy to
David his anointed, and to his seed for ever.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="23">2 Samuel 23</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Now these are David's last words. David the son of Isai
said: The man to whom it was appointed concerning the Christ of the
God of Jacob, the excellent psalmist of Israel said:</span></li>
<li><span>The spirit of the Lord hath spoken by me and his word by
my tongue.</span></li>
<li><span>The God of Israel said to me, the strong one of Israel
spoke, the ruler of men, the just ruler in the fear of
God.</span></li>
<li><span>As the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, shineth
in the morning without clouds, and as the grass springeth out of
the earth by rain.</span></li>
<li><span>Neither is my house so great with God, that he should
make with me an eternal covenant, firm in all things and assured.
For he is all my salvation, and all my will: neither is there ought
thereof that springeth not up.</span></li>
<li><span>But transgressors shall all of them be plucked up as
thorns: which are not taken away with hands.</span></li>
<li><span>And if a man will touch them, he must be armed with iron
and with the staff of a lance: but they shall be set on fire and
burnt to nothing.</span></li>
<li><span>These are the names of the valiant men of David. Jesbaham
sitting in the chair was the wisest chief among the three, he was
like the most tender little worm of the wood, who killed eight
hundred men at one onset.</span></li>
<li><span>After him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of
the three valiant men that were with David when they defied the
Philistines, and they were there gathered together to
battle.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the men of Israel were gone away, he stood and
smote the Philistines till his hand was weary, and grew stiff with
the sword: and the Lord wrought a great victory that day: and the
people that were fled away, returned to take spoils of them that
were slain.</span></li>
<li><span>And after him was Semma the son of Age of Arari. And the
Philistines were gathered together in a troop: for there was a
field full of lentils. And when the people were fled from the face
of the Philistines,</span></li>
<li><span>He stood in the midst of the field, and defended it, and
defeated the Philistines: and the Lord gave a great
victory.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover also before this the three who were princes
among the thirty, went down and came to David in the harvest time
into the cave of Odollam: and the camp of the Philistines was in
the valley of the giants.</span></li>
<li><span>And David was then in a hold. and there was a garrison of
the Philistines then in Bethlehem.</span></li>
<li><span>And David longed, and said: O that some man would get me
a drink of the water out of the cistern, that is in Bethlehem, by
the gate.</span></li>
<li><span>And the three valiant men broke through the camp of the
Philistines, and drew water out of the cistern of Bethlehem, that
was by the gate, and brought it to David: but he would not drink,
but offered it to the Lord,</span></li>
<li><span>Saying: The Lord be merciful to me, that I may not do
this: shall I drink the blood of these men that went, and the peril
of their lives? therefore he would not drink. These things did
these three mighty men.</span></li>
<li><span>Abisai also the brother of Joab, the son of Sarvia, was
chief among three: and he lifted up his spear against three hundred
whom he slew, and he was renowned among the three,</span></li>
<li><span>And the noblest of three, and was their chief, but to the
three first he attained not.</span></li>
<li><span>And Banaias the son of Joiada a most valiant man, of
great deeds, of Cabseel: he slew the two lions of Moab, and he went
down, and slew a lion in the midst of a pit, in the time of
snow.</span></li>
<li><span>He also slew an Egyptian, a man worthy to be a sight,
having a spear in his hand: but he went down to him with a rod, and
forced the spear out of the hand of the Egyptian, and slew him with
his own spear.</span></li>
<li><span>These things did Banaias the son of Joiada.</span></li>
<li><span>And he was renowned among the three valiant men, who were
the most honourable among the thirty: but he attained riot to the
first three: and David made him of his privy council.</span></li>
<li><span>Asael the brother of Joab was one of the thirty, Elehanan
the son of Dodo of Bethlehem.</span></li>
<li><span>Semma of Harodi, Elica of Harodi,</span></li>
<li><span>Heles of Phalti, Hira the son of Acces of
Thecua,</span></li>
<li><span>Abiezer of Anathoth, Mobonnai of Husati,</span></li>
<li><span>Selmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,</span></li>
<li><span>Heled the son of Baana, also a Netophathite, Ithai the
son of Ribai of Gabaath of the children of Benjamin,</span></li>
<li><span>Banaia the Pharathonite, Heddai of the torrent
Gaas,</span></li>
<li><span>Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth of Beromi,</span></li>
<li><span>Eliaba of Salaboni. The sons of Jassen,
Jonathan,</span></li>
<li><span>Semma of Orori, Aliam the son of Sarar the
Arorite,</span></li>
<li><span>Eliphelet the son of Aasbai the son of Machati, Eliam the
son of Achitophel the Gelonite,</span></li>
<li><span>Hesrai of Carmel, Pharai of Arbi,</span></li>
<li><span>Igaal the son of Nathan of Soba, Bonni of
Gadi,</span></li>
<li><span>Selec of Ammoni, Naharai the Berothite, armourbearer of
Joab the son of Sarvia,</span></li>
<li><span>Ira the Jethrite, Gareb also a Jethrite;</span></li>
<li><span>Urias the Hethite, thirty and seven in all.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="24">2 Samuel 24</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And the anger of the Lord was again kindled against
Israel, and stirred up David among them, saying: Go, number Israel
and Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said to Joab the general of his army: Go
through all the tribes of Israel from Dan to Bersabee, and number
ye the people that I may know the number of them.</span></li>
<li><span>And Joab said to the king: The Lord thy God increase thy
people, and make them as many more as they are now, and again
multiply them a hundredfold in the sight of my lord the king: but
what meaneth my lord the king by this kind of thing?</span></li>
<li><span>But the king's words prevailed over the words of Joab,
and of the captains of the army: and Joab, and the captains of the
soldiers went out from the presence of the king, to number the
people of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they had passed the Jordan, they came to Aroer
to the right side of the city, which is in the vale of
Gad.</span></li>
<li><span>And by Jazer they passed into Galaad, and to the lower
land of Hodsi, and they came into the woodlands of Dan. And going
about by Sidon,</span></li>
<li><span>They passed near the walls of Tyre, and all the land of
the Hevite, and the Chanaanite, and they came to the south of Juda
into Bersabee:</span></li>
<li><span>And having gone through the whole land, after nine months
and twenty days, they came to Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people to
the king, and there were found of Israel eight hundred thousand
valiant men that drew the sword: and of Juda five hundred thousand
fighting men.</span></li>
<li><span>But David's heart struck him, after the people were
numbered: and David said to the Lord: I have sinned very much in
what I have done: but I pray thee, O Lord, to take away the
iniquity of thy servant, because I have done exceeding
foolishly.</span></li>
<li><span>And David arose in the morning, and the word of the Lord
came to Gad the prophet and the seer of David, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Go, and say to David: Thus saith the Lord: I give thee
thy choice of three things, choose one of them which thou wilt,
that I may do it to thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Gad was come to David, he told him, saying:
Either seven years of famine shall come to thee in thy land: or
thou shalt flee three months before thy adversaries, and they shall
pursue thee: or for three days there shall be a pestilence in thy
land. Now therefore deliberate, and see what answer I shall return
to him that sent me.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to Gad: I am in a great strait: but it is
better that I should fall into the hands of the Lord (for his
mercies are many) than into the hands of men.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel, from the
morning unto the time appointed, and there died of the people from
Dan to Bersabee seventy thousand men.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the angel of the Lord had stretched out his hand
over Jerusalem to destroy it, the Lord had pity on the affliction,
and said to the angel that slew the people: It is enough: now hold
thy hand. And the angel of the Lord was by the thrashingfloor of
Areuna the Jebusite.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to the Lord, when he saw the angel
striking the people: It is I; I am he that have sinned, I have done
wickedly: these that are the sheep, what have they done? let thy
hand, I beseech thee, be turned against me, and against my father's
house.</span></li>
<li><span>And Gad came to David that day, and said: Go up, and
build an altar to the Lord in the thrashingfloor of Areuna the
Jebusite.</span></li>
<li><span>And David went up according to the word of Gad which the
Lord had commanded him.</span></li>
<li><span>And Areuna looked, and saw the king and his servants
coming towards him:</span></li>
<li><span>An going out he worshipped the king, bowing with his face
to the earth, and said: Wherefore is my lord the king come to his
servant? Arid David said to him: To buy the thrashingfloor of thee,
and build an altar to the Lord, that the plague, which rageth among
the people, may cease.</span></li>
<li><span>And Areuna said to David: Let my lord the king take, and
offer, as it seemeth good to him: thou hast here oxen for a
holocaust, and the wain, and the yokes of the oxen for
wood.</span></li>
<li><span>All these things Areuna as a king gave to the king: and
Areuna said to the king: The Lord thy God receive thy
vow.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king answered him, and said: Nay, but I will buy
it of thee at a price, and I will not offer to the Lord my God
holocausts free cost. So David bought the floor, and the oxen, for
fifty sicles of silver:</span></li>
<li><span>And David built there an altar to the Lord, and offered
holocausts and peace offerings: and the Lord became merciful to the
land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</span></li>
