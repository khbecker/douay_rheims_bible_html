<ol>
<li><span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and
Timothy our brother: to the church of God that is at Corinth, with
all the saints that are in all Achaia:</span></li>
<li><span>Grace unto you and peace from God our Father, and from
the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort.</span></li>
<li><span>Who comforteth us in all our tribulation; that we also
may be able to comfort them who are in all distress, by the
exhortation wherewith we also are exhorted by God.</span></li>
<li><span>For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us: so also by
Christ doth our comfort abound.</span></li>
<li><span>Now whether we be in tribulation, it is for your
exhortation and salvation: or whether we be comforted, it is for
your consolation: or whether we be exhorted, it is for your
exhortation and salvation, which worketh the enduring of the same
sufferings which we also suffer.</span></li>
<li><span>That our hope for you may be steadfast: knowing that as
you are partakers of the sufferings, so shall you be also of the
consolation.</span></li>
<li><span>For we would not have you ignorant,brethren, of our
tribulation, which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of
measure above our strength, so that we were weary even of
life.</span></li>
<li><span>But we had in ourselves the answer of death, that we
should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the
dead.</span></li>
<li><span>Who hath delivered and doth deliver us out of so great
dangers: in whom we trust that he will yet also deliver
us.</span></li>
<li><span>You helping withal in prayer for us: that for this gift
obtained for us, by the means of many persons, thanks may be given
by many in our behalf.</span></li>
<li><span>For our glory is this, the testimony of our conscience,
that in simplicity of heart and sincerity of God, and not in carnal
wisdom, but in the grace of God, we have conversed in this world:
and more abundantly towards you.</span></li>
<li><span>For we write no other things to you than what you have
read and known. And I hope that you shall know unto the
end:</span></li>
<li><span>As also you have known us in part, that we are your
glory, as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus
Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>And in this confidence I had a mind to come to you
before, that you might have a second grace:</span></li>
<li><span>And to pass by you into Macedonia, and again from
Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be brought on my way
towards Judea.</span></li>
<li><span>Whereas then I was thus minded, did I use lightness? Or,
the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh,
that there should be with me, It is, and It is not?</span></li>
<li><span>But God is faithful, for our preaching which was to you,
was not, It is, and It is not.</span></li>
<li><span>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ who was preached among
you by us, by me, and Sylvanus, and Timothy, was not, It is and It
is not, but, It is, was in him.</span></li>
<li><span>For all the promises of God are in him, It is; therefore
also by him, amen to God, unto our glory.</span></li>
<li><span>Now he that confirmeth us with you in Christ, and that
hath anointed us, is God:</span></li>
<li><span>Who also hath sealed us, and given the pledge of the
Spirit in our hearts.</span></li>
<li><span>But I call God to witness upon my soul, that to spare
you, I came not any more to Corinth: not because we exercise
dominion over your faith: but we are helpers of your joy: for in
faith you stand.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="2">2 Corinthians 2</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>But I determined this with myself, not to come to you
again in sorrow.</span></li>
<li><span>For if I make you sorrowful, who is he then that can make
me glad, but the same who is made sorrowful by me?</span></li>
<li><span>And I wrote this same to you; that I may not, when I
come, have sorrow upon sorrow, from them of whom I ought to
rejoice: having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of
you all.</span></li>
<li><span>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart, I wrote
to you with many tears: not that you should be made sorrowful: but
that you might know the charity I have more abundantly towards
you.</span></li>
<li><span>And if any one have caused grief, he hath not grieved me;
but in part, that I may not burden you all.</span></li>
<li><span>To him who is such a one, this rebuke is sufficient,
which is given by many:</span></li>
<li><span>So that on the contrary, you should rather forgive him
and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with
overmuch sorrow.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore, I beseech you, that you would confirm your
charity towards him.</span></li>
<li><span>For to this end also did I write, that I may know the
experiment of you, whether you be obedient in all
things.</span></li>
<li><span>And to whom you have pardoned any thing, I also. For,
what I have pardoned, if I have pardoned any thing, for your sakes
have I done it in the person of Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>That we be not overreached by Satan. For we are not
ignorant of his devices.</span></li>
<li><span>And when I was come to Troas for the gospel of Christ,
and a door was opened unto me in the Lord,</span></li>
<li><span>I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my
brother; but bidding them farewell, I went into
Macedonia.</span></li>
<li><span>Now thanks be to God, who always maketh us to triumph in
Christ Jesus, and manifesteth the odour of his knowledge by us in
every place.</span></li>
<li><span>For we are the good odour of Christ unto God, in them
that are saved, and in them that perish.</span></li>
<li><span>To the one indeed the odour of death unto death: but to
the others the odour of life unto life. And for these things who is
so sufficient?</span></li>
<li><span>For we are not as many, adulterating the word of God; but
with sincerity, but as from God, before God, in Christ we
speak.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="3">2 Corinthians 3</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Do we begin again to commend ourselves? Or do we need (as
some do) epistles of commendation to you, or from you?</span></li>
<li><span>You are our epistle, written in our hearts, which is
known and read by all men:</span></li>
<li><span>Being manifested, that you are the epistle of Christ,
ministered by us, and written not with ink, but with the Spirit of
the living God; not in tables of stone, but in the fleshly tables
of the heart.</span></li>
<li><span>And such confidence we have, through Christ, towards
God.</span></li>
<li><span>Not that we are sufficient to think any thing of
ourselves, as of ourselves: but our sufficiency is from
God.</span></li>
<li><span>Who also hath made us fit ministers of the new testament,
not in the letter, but in the spirit. For the letter killeth, but
the spirit quickeneth.</span></li>
<li><span>Now if the ministration of death, engraven with letters
upon stones, was glorious; so that the children of Israel could not
steadfastly behold the face of Moses, for the glory of his
countenance, which is made void:</span></li>
<li><span>How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather in
glory?</span></li>
<li><span>For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much
more the ministration of justice aboundeth in glory.</span></li>
<li><span>For even that which was glorious in this part was not
glorified, by reason of the glory that excelleth.</span></li>
<li><span>For if that which is done away was glorious, much more
that which remaineth is in glory.</span></li>
<li><span>Having therefore such hope, we use much
confidence:</span></li>
<li><span>And not as Moses put a veil upon his face, that the
children of Israel might not steadfastly look on the face of that
which is made void.</span></li>
<li><span>But their senses were made dull. For, until this present
day, the selfsame veil, in the reading of the old testament,
remaineth not taken away (because in Christ it is made
void).</span></li>
<li><span>But even until this day, when Moses is read, the veil is
upon their heart.</span></li>
<li><span>But when they shall be converted to the Lord, the veil
shall be taken away.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the Lord is a Spirit. And where the Spirit of the
Lord is, there is liberty.</span></li>
<li><span>But we all beholding the glory of the Lord with open
face, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as
by the Spirit of the Lord.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="4">2 Corinthians 4</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Therefore, seeing we have this ministration, according as
we have obtained mercy, we faint not;</span></li>
<li><span>But we renounce the hidden things of dishonesty, not
walking in craftiness, nor adulterating the word of God; but by
manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's
conscience, in the sight of God.</span></li>
<li><span>And if our gospel be also hid, it is hid to them that are
lost,</span></li>
<li><span>In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of
unbelievers, that the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ,
who is the image of God, should not shine unto them.</span></li>
<li><span>For we preach not ourselves, but Jesus Christ our Lord;
and ourselves your servants through Jesus.</span></li>
<li><span>For God, who commanded the light to shine out of
darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the
knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Christ
Jesus.</span></li>
<li><span>But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the
excellency may be of the power of God, and not of us.</span></li>
<li><span>In all things we suffer tribulation, but are not
distressed; we are straitened, but are not destitute;</span></li>
<li><span>We suffer persecution, but are not forsaken; we are cast
down, but we perish not:</span></li>
<li><span>Always bearing about in our body the mortification of
Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our
bodies.</span></li>
<li><span>For we who live are always delivered unto death for
Jesus' sake; that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in
our mortal flesh.</span></li>
<li><span>So then death worketh in us, but life in you.</span></li>
<li><span>But having the same spirit of faith, as it is written: I
believed, for which cause I have spoken; we also believe, for which
cause we speak also:</span></li>
<li><span>Knowing that he who raised up Jesus, will raise us up
also with Jesus, and place us with you.</span></li>
<li><span>For all things are for your sakes; that the grace
abounding through many, may abound in thanksgiving unto the glory
of God.</span></li>
<li><span>For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man
is corrupted, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.</span></li>
<li><span>For that which is at present momentary and light of our
tribulation, worketh for us above measure exceedingly an eternal
weight of glory.</span></li>
<li><span>While we look not at the things which are seen, but at
the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen, are
temporal; but the things which are not seen, are
eternal.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="5">2 Corinthians 5</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>For we know, if our earthly house of this habitation be
dissolved, that we have a building of God, a house not made with
hands, eternal in heaven.</span></li>
<li><span>For in this also we groan, desiring to be clothed upon
with our habitation that is from heaven.</span></li>
<li><span>Yet so that we be found clothed, not naked.</span></li>
<li><span>For we also, who are in this tabernacle, do groan, being
burthened; because we would not be unclothed, but clothed upon,
that that which is mortal may be swallowed up by life.</span></li>
<li><span>Now he that maketh us for this very thing, is God, who
hath given us the pledge of the Spirit.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore having always confidence, knowing that, while
we are in the body, we are absent from the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>(For we walk by faith, and not by sight.)</span></li>
<li><span>But we are confident, and have a good will to be absent
rather from the body, and to be present with the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And therefore we labour, whether absent or present, to
please him.</span></li>
<li><span>For we must all be manifested before the judgement seat
of Christ, that every one may receive the proper things of the
body, according as he hath done, whether it be good or
evil.</span></li>
<li><span>Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we use persuasion
to men; but to God we are manifest. And I trust also that in your
consciences we are manifest.</span></li>
<li><span>We commend not ourselves again to you, but give you
occasion to glory in our behalf; that you may have somewhat to
answer them who glory in face, and not in heart.</span></li>
<li><span>For whether we be transported in mind, it is to God; or
whether we be sober, it is for you.</span></li>
<li><span>For the charity of Christ presseth us: judging this, that
if one died for all, then all were dead.</span></li>
<li><span>And Christ died for all; that they also who live, may not
now live to themselves, but unto him who died for them, and rose
again.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore henceforth, we know no man according to the
flesh. And if we have known Christ according to the flesh; but now
we know him so no longer.</span></li>
<li><span>If then any be in Christ a new creature, the old things
are passed away, behold all things are made new.</span></li>
<li><span>But all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to
himself by Christ; and hath given to us the ministry of
reconciliation.</span></li>
<li><span>For God indeed was in Christ, reconciling the world to
himself, not imputing to them their sins; and he hath placed in us
the word of reconciliation.</span></li>
<li><span>For Christ therefore we are ambassadors, God as it were
exhorting by us. For Christ, we beseech you, be reconciled to
God.</span></li>
<li><span>Him, who knew no sin, he hath made sin for us, that we
might be made the justice of God in him.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="6">2 Corinthians 6</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And we helping do exhort you, that you receive not the
grace of God in vain.</span></li>
<li><span>For he saith: In an accepted time have I heard thee; and
in the day of salvation have I helped thee. Behold, now is the
acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.</span></li>
<li><span>Giving no offence to any man, that our ministry be not
blamed:</span></li>
<li><span>But in all things let us exhibit ourselves as the
ministers of God, in much patience, in tribulation, in necessities,
in distresses,</span></li>
<li><span>In stripes, in prisons, in seditions, in labours, in
watchings, in fastings,</span></li>
<li><span>In chastity, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in
sweetness, in the Holy Ghost, in charity unfeigned,</span></li>
<li><span>In the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armour
of justice on the right hand and on the left;</span></li>
<li><span>By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report;
as deceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and yet known;</span></li>
<li><span>As dying, and behold we live; as chastised, and not
killed;</span></li>
<li><span>As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as needy, yet
enriching many; as having nothing, and possessing all
things.</span></li>
<li><span>Our mouth is open to you, O ye Corinthians, our heart is
enlarged.</span></li>
<li><span>You are not straitened in us, but in your own bowels you
are straitened.</span></li>
<li><span>But having the same recompense, (I speak as to my
children,) be you also enlarged.</span></li>
<li><span>Bear not the yoke with unbelievers. For what
participation hath justice with injustice? Or what fellowship hath
light with darkness?</span></li>
<li><span>And what concord hath Christ with Belial? Or what part
hath the faithful with the unbeliever?</span></li>
<li><span>And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? For
you are the temple of the living God; as God saith: I will dwell in
them, and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they shall
be my people.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore, Go out from among them, and be ye separate,
saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing:</span></li>
<li><span>And I will receive you; and I will be a Father to you;
and you shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord
Almighty.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="7">2 Corinthians 7</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us
cleanse ourselves from all defilement of the flesh and of the
spirit, perfecting sactification in the fear of God.</span></li>
<li><span>Receive us. We have injured no man, we have corrupted no
man, we have overreached no man.</span></li>
<li><span>I speak not this to your condemnation. For we have said
before, that you are in our hearts, to die together, and to live
together.</span></li>
<li><span>Great is my confidence for you, great is my glorying for
you. I am filled with comfort: I exceedingly abound with joy in all
our tribulation.</span></li>
<li><span>For also when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had
no rest, but we suffered all tribulation; combats without, fears
within.</span></li>
<li><span>But God, who comforteth the humble, comforted us by the
coming of Titus.</span></li>
<li><span>And not by his coming only, but also by the consolation,
wherewith he was comforted in you, relating to us your desire, your
mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced the
more.</span></li>
<li><span>For although I made you sorrowful by my epistle, I do not
repent; and if I did repent, seeing that the same epistle (although
but for a time) did make you sorrowful;</span></li>
<li><span>Now I am glad: not because you were made sorrowful; but
because you were made sorrowful unto penance. For you were made
sorrowful according to God, that you might suffer damage by us in
nothing.</span></li>
<li><span>For the sorrow that is according to God worketh penance,
steadfast unto salvation; but the sorrow of the world worketh
death.</span></li>
<li><span>For behold this selfsame thing, that you were made
sorrowful according to God, how great carefulness it worketh in
you; yea defence, yea indignation, yea fear, yea desire, yea zeal,
yea revenge: in all things you have shewed yourselves to be
undefiled in the matter.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore although I wrote to you, it was not for his
sake that I did the wrong, nor for him that suffered it; but to
manifest our carefulness that we have for you</span></li>
<li><span>Before God: therefore we were comforted. But in our
consolation, we did the more abundantly rejoice for the joy of
Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.</span></li>
<li><span>And if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I have not
been put to shame; but as we have spoken all things to you in
truth, so also our boasting that was made to Titus is found a
truth.</span></li>
<li><span>And his bowels are more abundantly towards you;
remembering the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling
you have received him.</span></li>
<li><span>I rejoice that in all things I have confidence in
you.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="8">2 Corinthians 8</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Now we make known unto you, brethren, the grace of God,
that hath been given in the churches of Macedonia.</span></li>
<li><span>That in much experience of tribulation, they have had
abundance of joy; and their very deep poverty hath abounded unto
the riches of their simplicity.</span></li>
<li><span>For according to their power ( I bear them witness), and
beyond their power, they were willing.</span></li>
<li><span>With much entreaty begging of us the grace and
communication of the ministry that is done toward the
saints.</span></li>
<li><span>And not as we hoped, but they gave their own selves first
to the Lord, then to us by the will of God:</span></li>
<li><span>Insomuch, that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so
also he would finish among you this same grace.</span></li>
<li><span>That as in all things you abound in faith, and word, and
knowledge, and all carefulness; moreover also in your charity
towards us, so in this grace also you may abound.</span></li>
<li><span>I speak not as commanding; but by the carefulness of
others, approving also the good disposition of your
charity.</span></li>
<li><span>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that
being rich he became poor, for your sakes; that through his poverty
you might be rich.</span></li>
<li><span>And herein I give my advice; for this is profitable for
you, who have begun not only to do, but also to be willing, a year
ago.</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore perform ye it also in deed; that as your
mind is forward to be willing, so it may be also to perform, out of
that which you have.</span></li>
<li><span>For if the will be forward, it is accepted according to
that which a man hath, not according to that which he hath
not.</span></li>
<li><span>For I mean not that others should be eased, and you
burthened, but by an equality.</span></li>
<li><span>In this present time let your abundance supply their
want, that their abundance also may supply your want, that there
may be an equality,</span></li>
<li><span>As it is written: He that had much, had nothing over; and
he that had little, had no want.</span></li>
<li><span>And thanks be to God, who hath given the same carefulness
for you in the heart of Titus.</span></li>
<li><span>For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more
careful, of his own will he went unto you.</span></li>
<li><span>We have sent also with him the brother, whose praise is
in the gospel through all the churches.</span></li>
<li><span>And not that only, but he was also ordained by the
churches companion of our travels, for this grace, which is
administered by us, to the glory of the Lord, and our determined
will:</span></li>
<li><span>Avoiding this, lest any man should blame us in this
abundance which is administered by us.</span></li>
<li><span>For we forecast what may be good not only before God, but
also before men.</span></li>
<li><span>And we have sent with them our brother also, whom we have
often proved diligent in many things; but now much more diligent,
with much confidence in you,</span></li>
<li><span>Either for Titus, who is my companion and fellow labourer
towards you, or our brethren, the apostles of the churches, the
glory of Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore shew ye to them, in the sight of the churches,
the evidence of your charity, and of our boasting on your
behalf.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="9">2 Corinthians 9</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>For concerning the ministry that is done towards the
saints, it is superfluous for me to write unto you.</span></li>
<li><span>For I know your forward mind: for which I boast of you to
the Macedonians. That Achaia also is ready from the year past, and
your emulation hath provoked very many.</span></li>
<li><span>Now I have sent the brethren, that the thing which we
boast of concerning you, be not made void in this behalf, that (as
I have said) you may be ready:</span></li>
<li><span>Lest, when the Macedonians shall come with me, and find
you unprepared, we (not to say ye) should be ashamed in this
matter.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore I thought it necessary to desire the brethren
that they would go to you before, and prepare this blessing before
promised, to be ready, so as a blessing, not as
covetousness.</span></li>
<li><span>Now this I say: He who soweth sparingly, shall also reap
sparingly: and he who soweth in blessings, shall also reap
blessings.</span></li>
<li><span>Every one as he hath determined in his heart, not with
sadness, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful
giver.</span></li>
<li><span>And God is able to make all grace abound in you; that ye
always, having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every
good work,</span></li>
<li><span>As it is written: He hath dispersed abroad, he hath given
to the poor: his justice remaineth for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>And he that ministereth seed to the sower, will both give
you bread to eat, and will multiply your seed, and increase the
growth of the fruits of your justice:</span></li>
<li><span>That being enriched in all things, you may abound unto
all simplicity, which worketh through us thanksgiving to
God.</span></li>
<li><span>Because the administration of this office doth not only
supply the want of the saints, but aboundeth also by many
thanksgivings in the Lord,</span></li>
<li><span>By the proof of this ministry, glorifying God for the
obedience of your confession unto the gospel of Christ, and for the
simplicity of your communicating unto them, and unto
all.</span></li>
<li><span>And in their praying for you, being desirous of you,
because of the excellent grace of God in you.</span></li>
<li><span>Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>Now I Paul myself beseech you, by the mildness and
modesty of Christ, who in presence indeed am lowly among you, but
being absent, am bold toward you.</span></li>
<li><span>But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am
present, with that confidence wherewith I am thought to be bold,
against some, who reckon us as if we walked according to the
flesh.</span></li>
<li><span>For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according
to the flesh.</span></li>
<li><span>For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty
to God unto the pulling down of fortifications, destroying
counsels,</span></li>
<li><span>And every height that exhalteth itself against the
knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every understanding
unto the obedience of Christ;</span></li>
<li><span>And having in readiness to revenge all disobedience, when
your obedience shall be fulfilled.</span></li>
<li><span>See the things that are according to outward appearance.
If any man trust to himself, that he is Christ's, let him think
this again with himself, that as he is Christ's, so are we
also.</span></li>
<li><span>For if also I should boast somewhat more of our power,
which the Lord hath given us unto edification, and not for your
destruction, I should not be ashamed.</span></li>
<li><span>But that I may not be thought as it were to terrify you
by epistles,</span></li>
<li><span>(For his epistles indeed, say they, are weighty and
strong; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech
contemptible,)</span></li>
<li><span>Let such a one think this, that such as we are in word by
epistles, when absent, such also we will be indeed when
present.</span></li>
<li><span>For we dare not match, or compare ourselves with some,
that commend themselves; but we measure ourselves by ourselves, and
compare ourselves with ourselves.</span></li>
<li><span>But we will not glory beyond our measure; but according
to the measure of the rule, which God hath measured to us, a
measure to reach even unto you.</span></li>
<li><span>For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as if we
reached not unto you. For we are come as far as to you in the
gospel of Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>Not glorying beyond measure in other men's labours; but
having hope of your increasing faith, to be magnified in you
according to our rule abundantly;</span></li>
<li><span>Yea, unto those places that are beyond you, to preach the
gospel, not to glory in another man's rule, in those things that
are made ready to our hand.</span></li>
<li><span>But he that glorieth, let him glory in the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>For not he who commendeth himself, is approved, but he,
whom God commendeth.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>Would to God you could bear with some little of my folly:
but do bear with me.</span></li>
<li><span>For I am jealous of you with the jealousy of God. For I
have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste
virgin to Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>But I fear lest, as the serpent seduced Eve by his
subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted, and fall from the
simplicity that is in Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>For if he that cometh preacheth another Christ, whom we
have not preached; or if you receive another Spirit, whom you have
not received; or another gospel which you have not received; you
might well bear with him.</span></li>
<li><span>For I suppose that I have done nothing less than the
great apostles.</span></li>
<li><span>For although I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge;
but in all things we have been made manifest to you.</span></li>
<li><span>Or did I commit a fault, humbling myself, that you might
be exalted? Because I preached unto you the gospel of God
freely?</span></li>
<li><span>I have taken from other churches, receiving wages of them
for your ministry.</span></li>
<li><span>And, when I was present with you, and wanted, I was
chargeable to no man: for that which was wanting to me, the
brethren supplied who came from Macedonia; and in all things I have
kept myself from being burthensome to you, and so I will keep
myself.</span></li>
<li><span>The truth of Christ is in me, that this glorying shall
not be broken off in me in the regions of Achaia.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore? Because I love you not? God knoweth
it.</span></li>
<li><span>But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off the
occasion from them that desire occasion, that wherein they glory,
they may be found even as we.</span></li>
<li><span>For such false apostles are deceitful workmen,
transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>And no wonder: for Satan himself transformeth himself
into an angel of light.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers be
transformed as the ministers of justice, whose end shall be
according to their works.</span></li>
<li><span>I say again, (let no man think me to be foolish,
otherwise take me as one foolish, that I also may glory a
little.)</span></li>
<li><span>That which I speak, I speak not according to God, but as
it were in foolishness, in this matter of glorying.</span></li>
<li><span>Seeing that many glory according to the flesh, I will
glory also.</span></li>
<li><span>For you gladly suffer the foolish; whereas yourselves are
wise.</span></li>
<li><span>For you suffer if a man bring you into bondage, if a man
devour you, if a man take from you, if a man be lifted up, if a man
strike you on the face.</span></li>
<li><span>I speak according to dishonour, as if we had been weak in
this part. Wherein if any man dare (I speak foolishly), I dare
also.</span></li>
<li><span>They are Hebrews: so am I. They are Israelites: so am I.
They are the seed of Abraham: so am I.</span></li>
<li><span>They are the ministers of Christ (I speak as one less
wise): I am more; in many more labours, in prisons more frequently,
in stripes above measure, in deaths often.</span></li>
<li><span>Of the Jews five times did I receive forty stripes, save
one.</span></li>
<li><span>Thrice was I beaten with rods, once I was stoned, thrice
I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I was in the depth of the
sea.</span></li>
<li><span>In journeying often, in perils of waters, in perils of
robbers, in perils from my own nation, in perils from the Gentiles,
in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in
the sea, in perils from false brethren.</span></li>
<li><span>In labour and painfulness, in much watchings, in hunger
and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.</span></li>
<li><span>Besides those things which are without: my daily
instance, the solicitude for all the churches.</span></li>
<li><span>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is scandalized, and I
am not on fire?</span></li>
<li><span>If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things that
concern my infirmity.</span></li>
<li><span>The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is
blessed for ever, knoweth that I lie not.</span></li>
<li><span>At Damascus, the governor of the nation under Aretas the
king, guarded the city of the Damascenes, to apprehend
me.</span></li>
<li><span>And through a window in a basket was I let down by the
wall, and so escaped his hands.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>If I must glory (it is not expedient indeed): but I will
come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>I know a man in Christ above fourteen years ago (whether
in the body, I know not, or out of the body, I know not; God
knoweth), such a one caught up to the third heaven.</span></li>
<li><span>And I know such a man (whether in the body, or out of the
body, I know not: God knoweth):</span></li>
<li><span>That he was caught up into paradise, and heard secret
words, which it is not granted to man to utter.</span></li>
<li><span>For such an one I will glory; but for myself I will glory
nothing, but in my infirmities.</span></li>
<li><span>For though I should have a mind to glory, I shall not be
foolish; for I will say the truth. But I forbear, lest any man
should think of me above that which he seeth in me, or any thing he
heareth from me.</span></li>
<li><span>And lest the greatness of the revelations should exalt
me, there was given me a sting of my flesh, an angel of Satan, to
buffet me.</span></li>
<li><span>For which thing thrice I besought the Lord, that it might
depart from me.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to me: My grace is sufficient for thee; for
power is made perfect in infirmity. Gladly therefore will I glory
in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may dwell in
me.</span></li>
<li><span>For which cause I please myself in my infirmities, in
reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for
Christ. For when I am weak, then am I powerful.</span></li>
<li><span>I am become foolish: you have compelled me. For I ought
to have been commended by you: for I have no way come short of them
that are above measure apostles, although I be nothing.</span></li>
<li><span>Yet the signs of my apostleship have been wrought on you,
in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty
deeds.</span></li>
<li><span>For what is there that you have had less than the other
churches, but that I myself was not burthensome to you? Pardon me
this injury.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold now the third time I am ready to come to you; and
I will not be burthensome unto you. For I seek not the things that
are yours, but you. For neither ought the children to lay up for
the parents, but the parents for the children.</span></li>
<li><span>But I most gladly will spend and be spent myself for your
souls; although loving you more, I be loved less.</span></li>
<li><span>But be it so: I did not burthen you: but being crafty, I
caught you by guile.</span></li>
<li><span>Did I overreach you by any of them whom I sent to
you?</span></li>
<li><span>I desired Titus, and I sent with him a brother. Did Titus
overreach you? Did we not walk with the same spirit? did we not in
the same steps?</span></li>
<li><span>Of old, think you that we excuse ourselves to you? We
speak before God in Christ; but all things, my dearly beloved, for
your edification.</span></li>
<li><span>For I fear lest perhaps when I come I shall not find you
such as I would, and that I shall be found by you such as you would
not. Lest perhaps contentions, envyings, animosities, dissensions,
detractions, whisperings, swellings, seditions, be among
you.</span></li>
<li><span>Lest again, when I come, God humble me among you: and I
mourn many of them that sinned before, and have not done penance
for the uncleanness, and fornication, and lasciviousness, that they
have committed.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="13">2 Corinthians 13</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Behold, this is the third time I am coming to you: In the
mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word stand.</span></li>
<li><span>I have told before, and foretell, as present, and now
absent, to them that sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I
come again, I will not spare.</span></li>
<li><span>Do you seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me, who
towards you is not weak, but is mighty in you?</span></li>
<li><span>For although he was crucified through weakness, yet he
liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him: but we
shall live with him by the power of God towards you.</span></li>
<li><span>Try your own selves if you be in the faith; prove ye
yourselves. Know you not your own selves, that Christ Jesus is in
you, unless perhaps you be reprobates?</span></li>
<li><span>But I trust that you shall know that we are not
reprobates.</span></li>
<li><span>Now we pray God, that you may do no evil, not that we may
appear approved, but that you may do that which is good, and that
we may be as reprobates.</span></li>
<li><span>For we can do nothing against the truth; but for the
truth.</span></li>
<li><span>For we rejoice that we are weak, and you are strong. This
also we pray for, your perfection.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore I write these things, being absent, that, being
present, I may not deal more severely, according to the power which
the Lord hath given me unto edification, and not unto
destruction.</span></li>
<li><span>For the rest, brethren, rejoice, be perfect, take
exhortation, be of one mind, have peace; and the God of peace and
of love shall be with you.</span></li>
<li><span>Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the saints
salute you.</span></li>
<li><span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the charity of
God, and the communication of the Holy Ghost be with you all.
Amen.</span></li>
