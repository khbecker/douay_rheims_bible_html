<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="1">1 Timothy 1</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the
commandment of God our Savior, and of Christ Jesus our
hope:</span></li>
<li><span>To Timothy, his beloved son in faith. Grace, mercy, and
peace from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus our
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>As I desired thee to remain at Ephesus when I went into
Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some not to teach
otherwise,</span></li>
<li><span>Not to give heed to fables and endless genealogies: which
furnish questions rather than the edification of God, which is in
faith.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the end of the commandment is charity, from a pure
heart, and a good conscience, and an unfeigned faith.</span></li>
<li><span>From which things some going astray, are turned aside
unto vain babbling:</span></li>
<li><span>Desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither
the things they say, nor whereof they affirm.</span></li>
<li><span>But we know that the law is good, if a man use it
lawfully:</span></li>
<li><span>Knowing this, that the law is not made for the just man,
but for the unjust and disobedient, for the ungodly, and for
sinners, for the wicked and defiled, for murderers of fathers, and
murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</span></li>
<li><span>For fornicators, for them who defile themselves with
mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and
whatever other thing is contrary to sound doctrine,</span></li>
<li><span>Which is according to the gospel of the glory of the
blessed God, which hath been committed to my trust.</span></li>
<li><span>I give thanks who hath strengthened me, even to Christ
Jesus our Lord, for that he hath counted me faithful, putting me in
the ministry;</span></li>
<li><span>Who before was a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and
contumelious. But I obtained the mercy of God, because I did it
ignorantly in unbelief.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the grace of our Lord hath abounded exceedingly with
faith and love, which is in Christ Jesus.</span></li>
<li><span>A faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that
Christ Jesus came into this world to save sinners, of whom I am the
chief.</span></li>
<li><span>But for this cause have I obtained mercy: that in me
first Christ Jesus might shew forth all patience, for the
information of them that shall believe in him unto life
everlasting.</span></li>
<li><span>Now to the king of ages, immortal, invisible, the only
God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span></li>
<li><span>This precept I commend to thee, O son Timothy; according
to the prophecies going before on thee, that thou war in them a
good warfare,</span></li>
<li><span>Having faith and a good conscience, which some rejecting
have made shipwreck concerning the faith.</span></li>
<li><span>Of whom is Hymeneus and Alexander, whom I have delivered
up to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="2">1 Timothy 2</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>I desire therefore, first of all, that supplications,
prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all
men:</span></li>
<li><span>For kings, and for all that are in high station: that we
may lead a quiet and a peaceable life in all piety and
chastity.</span></li>
<li><span>For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our
Saviour,</span></li>
<li><span>Who will have all men to be saved, and to come to the
knowledge of the truth.</span></li>
<li><span>For there is one God, and one mediator of God and men,
the man Christ Jesus:</span></li>
<li><span>Who gave himself a redemption for all, a testimony in due
times.</span></li>
<li><span>Whereunto I am appointed a preacher and an apostle, (I
say the truth, I lie not,) a doctor of the Gentiles in faith and
truth.</span></li>
<li><span>I will therefore that men pray in every place, lifting up
pure hands, without anger and contention.</span></li>
<li><span>In like manner women also in decent apparel: adorning
themselves with modesty and sobriety, not with plaited hair, or
gold, or pearls, or costly attire,</span></li>
<li><span>But as it becometh women professing godliness, with good
works.</span></li>
<li><span>Let the woman learn in silence, with all
subjection.</span></li>
<li><span>But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to use authority
over the man: but to be in silence.</span></li>
<li><span>For Adam was first formed; then Eve.</span></li>
<li><span>And Adam was not seduced; but the woman being seduced,
was in the transgression.</span></li>
<li><span>Yet she shall be saved through childbearing; if she
continue in faith, and love, and sanctification, with
sobriety.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="3">1 Timothy 3</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>A faithful saying: if a man desire the office of a
bishop, he desireth a good work.</span></li>
<li><span>It behoveth therefore a bishop to be blameless, the
husband of one wife, sober, prudent, of good behaviour, chaste,
given to hospitality, a teacher,</span></li>
<li><span>Not given to wine, no striker, but modest, not
quarrelsome, not covetous, but</span></li>
<li><span>One that ruleth well his own house, having his children
in subjection with all chastity.</span></li>
<li><span>But if a man know not how to rule his own house, how
shall he take care of the church of God?</span></li>
<li><span>Not a neophyte: lest being puffed up with pride, he fall
into the judgment of the devil.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover he must have a good testimony of them who are
without: lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the
devil.</span></li>
<li><span>Deacons in like manner chaste, not double tongued, not
given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre:</span></li>
<li><span>Holding the mystery of faith in a pure
conscience.</span></li>
<li><span>And let these also first be proved: and so let them
minister, having no crime.</span></li>
<li><span>The women in like manner chaste, not slanderers, but
sober, faithful in all things.</span></li>
<li><span>Let deacons be the husbands of one wife: who rule well
their children, and their own houses.</span></li>
<li><span>For they that have ministered well, shall purchase to
themselves a good degree, and much confidence in the faith which is
in Christ Jesus.</span></li>
<li><span>These things I write to thee, hoping that I shall come to
thee shortly.</span></li>
<li><span>But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou
oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church
of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.</span></li>
<li><span>And evidently great is the mystery of godliness, which
was manifested in the flesh, was justified in the spirit, appeared
unto angels, hath been preached unto the Gentiles, is believed in
the world, is taken up in glory.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="4">1 Timothy 4</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Now the Spirit manifestly saith, that in the last times
some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to spirits of error,
and doctrines of devils,</span></li>
<li><span>Speaking lies in hypocrisy, and having their conscience
seared,</span></li>
<li><span>Forbidding to marry, to abstain from meats, which God
hath created to be received with thanksgiving by the faithful, and
by them that have known the truth.</span></li>
<li><span>For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be
rejected that is received with thanksgiving:</span></li>
<li><span>For it is sanctified by the word of God and
prayer.</span></li>
<li><span>These things proposing to the brethren, thou shalt be a
good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished up in the words of faith,
and of the good doctrine which thou hast attained unto.</span></li>
<li><span>But avoid foolish and old wives' fables: and exercise
thyself unto godliness.</span></li>
<li><span>For bodily exercise is profitable to little: but
godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the life
that now is, and of that which is to come.</span></li>
<li><span>A faithful saying and worthy of all
acceptation.</span></li>
<li><span>For therefore we labor and are reviled, because we hope
in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of the
faithful.</span></li>
<li><span>These things command and teach.</span></li>
<li><span>Let no man despise thy youth: but be thou an example of
the faithful in word, in conversation, in charity, in faith, in
chastity.</span></li>
<li><span>Till I come, attend unto reading, to exhortation, and to
doctrine.</span></li>
<li><span>Neglect not the grace that is in thee, which was given
thee by prophesy, with imposition of the hands of the
priesthood.</span></li>
<li><span>Meditate upon these things, be wholly in these things:
that thy profiting may be manifest to all.</span></li>
<li><span>Take heed to thyself and to doctrine: be earnest in them.
For in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear
thee.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="5">1 Timothy 5</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>An ancient man rebuke not, but entreat him as a father:
young men, as brethren:</span></li>
<li><span>Old women, as mothers: young women, as sisters, in all
chastity.</span></li>
<li><span>Honour widows, that are widows indeed.</span></li>
<li><span>But if any widow have children, or grandchildren, let her
learn first to govern her own house, and to make a return of duty
to her parents: for this is acceptable before God.</span></li>
<li><span>But she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, let her
trust in God, and continue in supplications and prayers night and
day.</span></li>
<li><span>For she that liveth in pleasures, is dead while she is
living.</span></li>
<li><span>And this give in charge, that they may be
blameless.</span></li>
<li><span>But if any man have not care of his own, and especially
of those of his house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than
an infidel.</span></li>
<li><span>Let a widow be chosen of no less than threescore years of
age, who hath been the wife of one husband.</span></li>
<li><span>Having testimony for her good works, if she have brought
up children, if she have received to harbour, if she have washed
the saints' feet, if she have ministered to them that suffer
tribulation, if she have diligently followed every good
work.</span></li>
<li><span>But the younger widows avoid. For when they have grown
wanton in Christ, they will marry:</span></li>
<li><span>Having damnation, because they have made void their first
faith.</span></li>
<li><span>And withal being idle they learn to go about from house
to house: and are not only idle, but tattlers also, and busybodies,
speaking things which they ought not.</span></li>
<li><span>I will therefore that the younger should marry, bear
children, be mistresses of families, give no occasion to the
adversary to speak evil.</span></li>
<li><span>For some are already turned aside after
Satan.</span></li>
<li><span>If any of the faithful have widows, let him minister to
them, and let not the church be charged: that there may be
sufficient for them that are widows indeed.</span></li>
<li><span>Let the priests that rule well, be esteemed worthy of
double honour: especially they who labour in the word and
doctrine:</span></li>
<li><span>For the scripture saith: Thou shalt not muzzle the ox
that treadeth out the corn: and, The labourer is worthy of his
reward.</span></li>
<li><span>Against a priest receive not an accusation, but under two
or three witnesses.</span></li>
<li><span>Them that sin reprove before all: that the rest also may
have fear.</span></li>
<li><span>I charge thee before God, and Christ Jesus, and the elect
angels, that thou observe these things without prejudice, doing
nothing by declining to either side.</span></li>
<li><span>Impose not hands lightly upon any man, neither be
partaker of other men's sins. Keep thyself chaste.</span></li>
<li><span>Do not still drink water, but use a little wine for thy
stomach's sake, and thy frequent infirmities.</span></li>
<li><span>Some men's sins are manifest, going before to judgment:
and some men they follow after.</span></li>
<li><span>In like manner also good deeds are manifest: and they
that are otherwise, cannot be hid.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="6">1 Timothy 6</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Whosoever are servants under the yoke, let them count
their masters worthy of all honour; lest the name of the Lord and
his doctrine be blasphemed.</span></li>
<li><span>But they that have believing masters, let them not
despise them, because they are brethren; but serve them the rather,
because they are faithful and beloved, who are partakers of the
benefit. These things teach and exhort.</span></li>
<li><span>If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to the sound
words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to that doctrine which is
according to godliness,</span></li>
<li><span>He is proud, knowing nothing, but sick about questions
and strifes of words; from which arise envies, contentions,
blasphemies, evil suspicions,</span></li>
<li><span>Conflicts of men corrupted in mind, and who are destitute
of the truth, supposing gain to be godliness.</span></li>
<li><span>But godliness with contentment is great gain.</span></li>
<li><span>For we brought nothing into this world: and certainly we
can carry nothing out.</span></li>
<li><span>But having food, and wherewith to be covered, with these
we are content.</span></li>
<li><span>For they that will become rich, fall into temptation, and
into the snare of the devil, and into many unprofitable and hurtful
desires, which drown men into destruction and
perdition.</span></li>
<li><span>For the desire of money is the root of all evils; which
some coveting have erred from the faith, and have entangled
themselves in many sorrows.</span></li>
<li><span>But thou, O man of God, fly these things: and pursue
justice, godliness, faith, charity, patience, mildness.</span></li>
<li><span>Fight the good fight of faith: lay hold on eternal life,
whereunto thou art called, and hast confessed a good confession
before many witnesses.</span></li>
<li><span>I charge thee before God, who quickeneth all things, and
before Christ Jesus, who gave testimony under Pontius Pilate, a
good confession,</span></li>
<li><span>That thou keep the commandment without spot, blameless,
unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,</span></li>
<li><span>Which in his times he shall shew who is the Blessed and
only Mighty, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;</span></li>
<li><span>Who only hath immortality, and inhabiteth light
inaccessible, whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour
and empire everlasting. Amen.</span></li>
<li><span>Charge the rich of this world not to be highminded, nor
to trust in the uncertainty of riches, but in the living God, (who
giveth us abundantly all things to enjoy,)</span></li>
<li><span>To do good, to be rich in good works, to give easily, to
communicate to others,</span></li>
<li><span>To lay up in store for themselves a good foundation
against the time to come, that they may lay hold on the true
life.</span></li>
<li><span>O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust,
avoiding the profane novelties of words, and oppositions of
knowledge falsely so called.</span></li>
<li><span>Which some promising, have erred concerning the faith.
Grace be with thee. Amen.</span></li>
