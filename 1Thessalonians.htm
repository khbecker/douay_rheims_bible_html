<ol>
<li><span>Paul and Sylvanus and Timothy: to the church of the
Thessalonians, in God the Father, and in the Lord Jesus
Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>Grace be to you and peace. We give thanks to God always
for you all; making a remembrance of you in our prayers without
ceasing,</span></li>
<li><span>Being mindful of the work of your faith, and labour, and
charity, and of the enduring of the hope of our Lord Jesus Christ
before God and our Father:</span></li>
<li><span>Knowing, brethren beloved of God, your
election:</span></li>
<li><span>For our gospel hath not been unto you in word only, but
in power also, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much fulness, as you
know what manner of men we have been among you for your
sakes.</span></li>
<li><span>And you became followers of us, and of the Lord;
receiving the word in much tribulation, with joy of the Holy
Ghost:</span></li>
<li><span>So that you were made a pattern to all that believe in
Macedonia and in Achaia.</span></li>
<li><span>For from you was spread abroad the word of the Lord, not
only in Macedonia, and in Achaia, but also in every place, your
faith which is towards God, is gone forth, so that we need not to
speak any thing.</span></li>
<li><span>For they themselves relate of us, what manner of entering
in we had unto you; and how you turned to God from idols, to serve
the living and true God.</span></li>
<li><span>And to wait for his Son from heaven (whom he raised up
from the dead,) Jesus, who hath delivered us from the wrath to
come.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="2">1 Thessalonians 2</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>For yourselves know, brethren, our entrance in unto you,
that it was not in vain:</span></li>
<li><span>But having suffered many things before, and been
shamefully treated (as you know) at Philippi, we had confidence in
our God, to speak unto you the gospel of God in much
carefulness.</span></li>
<li><span>For our exhortation was not of error, nor of uncleanness,
nor in deceit:</span></li>
<li><span>But as we were approved by God that the gospel should be
committed to us: even so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God,
who proveth our hearts.</span></li>
<li><span>For neither have we used, at any time, the speech of
flattery, as you know; nor taken an occasion of covetousness, God
is witness:</span></li>
<li><span>Nor sought we glory of men, neither of you, nor of
others. 7 Whereas we might have been burdensome to you, as the
apostles of Christ: but we became little ones in the midst of you,
as if a nurse should cherish her children:</span></li>
<li><span>So desirous of you, we would gladly impart unto you not
only the gospel of God, but also our own souls: because you were
become most dear unto us.</span></li>
<li><span>For you remember, brethren, our labour and toil: working
night and day, lest we should be chargeable to any of you, we
preached among you the gospel of God.</span></li>
<li><span>You are witnesses, and God also, how holily, and justly,
and without blame, we have been to you that have
believed:</span></li>
<li><span>As you know in what manner, entreating and comforting
you, (as a father doth his children,)</span></li>
<li><span>We testified to every one of you, that you would walk
worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and
glory.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore, we also give thanks to God without ceasing:
because, that when you had received of us the word of the hearing
of God, you received it not as the word of men, but (as it is
indeed) the word of God, who worketh in you that have
believed.</span></li>
<li><span>For you, brethren, are become followers of the churches
of God which are in Judea, in Christ Jesus: for you also have
suffered the same things from your own coutrymen, even as they have
from the Jews,</span></li>
<li><span>Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and the prophets, and
have persecuted us, and please not God, and are adversaries to all
men;</span></li>
<li><span>Prohibiting us to speak to the Gentiles, that they may be
saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath of God is come
upon them to the end.</span></li>
<li><span>But we, brethren, being taken away from you for a short
time, in sight, not in heart, have hastened the more abundantly to
see your face with great desire.</span></li>
<li><span>For we would have come unto you, I Paul indeed, once and
again: but Satan hath hindered us.</span></li>
<li><span>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of glory? Are not
you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his
coming?</span></li>
<li><span>For you are our glory and joy.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="3">1 Thessalonians 3</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>For which cause, forbearing no longer, we thought it good
to remain at Athens alone:</span></li>
<li><span>And we sent Timothy, our brother, and the minister of God
in the gospel of Christ, to confirm you and exhort you concerning
your faith:</span></li>
<li><span>That no man should be moved in these tribulations: for
yourselves know, that we are appointed thereunto.</span></li>
<li><span>For even when we were with you, we foretold you that we
should suffer tribulations, as also it is come to pass, and you
know.</span></li>
<li><span>For this cause also, I, forbearing no longer, sent to
know your faith: lest perhaps he that tempteth should have tempted
you, and our labour should be made vain.</span></li>
<li><span>But now when Timothy came to us from you, and related to
us your faith and charity, and that you have a good remembrance of
us always, desiring to see us as we also to see you;</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore we were comforted, brethren, in you, in all our
necessity and tribulation, by your faith,</span></li>
<li><span>Because now we live, if you stand in the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>For what thanks can we return to God for you, in all the
joy wherewith we rejoice for you before our God,</span></li>
<li><span>Night and day more abundantly praying that we may see
your face, and may accomplish those things that are wanting to your
faith?</span></li>
<li><span>Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus
Christ, direct our way unto you.</span></li>
<li><span>And may the Lord multiply you, and make you abound in
charity towards one another, and towards all men: as we do also
towards you,</span></li>
<li><span>To confirm your hearts without blame, in holiness, before
God and our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, with
all his saints. Amen.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="4">1 Thessalonians 4</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>For the rest therefore, brethren, we pray and beseech you
in the Lord Jesus, that as you have received from us, how you ought
to walk, and to please God, so also you would walk, that you may
abound the more.</span></li>
<li><span>For you know what precepts I have given to you by the
Lord Jesus.</span></li>
<li><span>For this is the will of God, your sanctification; that
you should abstain from fornication;</span></li>
<li><span>That every one of you should know how to possess his
vessel in sanctification and honour:</span></li>
<li><span>Not in the passion of lust, like the Gentiles that know
not God:</span></li>
<li><span>And that no man overreach, nor circumvent his brother in
business: because the Lord is the avenger of all these things, as
we have told you before, and have testified.</span></li>
<li><span>For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto
sanctification.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore, he that despiseth these things, despiseth not
man, but God, who also hath given his holy Spirit in
us.</span></li>
<li><span>But as touching the charity of brotherhood, we have no
need to write to you: for yourselves have learned of God to love
one another.</span></li>
<li><span>For indeed you do it towards all the brethren in all
Macedonia. But we entreat you, brethren, that you abound
more:</span></li>
<li><span>And that you use your endeavour to be quiet, and that you
do your own business, and work with your own hands, as we commanded
you: and that you walk honestly towards them that are without; and
that you want nothing of any man's.</span></li>
<li><span>And we will not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning
them that are asleep, that you be not sorrowful, even as others who
have no hope.</span></li>
<li><span>For if we believe that Jesus died, and rose again; even
so them who have slept through Jesus, will God bring with
him.</span></li>
<li><span>For this we say unto you in the word of the Lord, that we
who are alive, who remain unto the coming of the Lord, shall not
prevent them who have slept.</span></li>
<li><span>For the Lord himself shall come down from heaven with
commandment, and with the voice of an archangel, and with the
trumpet of God: and the dead who are in Christ, shall rise
first.</span></li>
<li><span>Then we who are alive, who are left, shall be taken up
together with them in the clouds to meet Christ, into the air, and
so shall we be always with the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore, comfort ye one another with these
words.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="5">1 Thessalonians 5</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>But of the times and moments, brethren, you need not,
that we should write to you;</span></li>
<li><span>For yourselves know perfectly, that the day of the Lord
shall so come, as a thief in the night.</span></li>
<li><span>For when they shall say, peace and security; then shall
sudden destruction come upon them, as the pains upon her that is
with child, and they shall not escape.</span></li>
<li><span>But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day
should overtake you as a thief.</span></li>
<li><span>For all you are the children of light, and children of
the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness. 6 Therefore, let
us not sleep, as others do; but let us watch, and be
sober.</span></li>
<li><span>For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that
are drunk, are drunk in the night.</span></li>
<li><span>But let us, who are of the day, be sober, having on the
breastplate of faith and charity, and for a helmet the hope of
salvation.</span></li>
<li><span>For God hath not appointed us unto wrath, but unto the
purchasing of salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,</span></li>
<li><span>Who died for us; that, whether we watch or sleep, we may
live together with him.</span></li>
<li><span>For which cause comfort one another; and edify one
another, as you also do.</span></li>
<li><span>And we beseech you, brethren, to know them who labour
among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish
you:</span></li>
<li><span>That you esteem them more abundantly in charity, for
their work's sake. Have peace with them.</span></li>
<li><span>And we beseech you, brethren, rebuke the unquiet, comfort
the feeble minded, support the weak, be patient towards all
men.</span></li>
<li><span>See that none render evil for evil to any man; but ever
follow that which is good towards each other, and towards all
men.</span></li>
<li><span>Always rejoice.</span></li>
<li><span>Pray without ceasing.</span></li>
<li><span>In all things give thanks; for this is the will of God in
Christ Jesus concerning you all.</span></li>
<li><span>Extinguish not the spirit.</span></li>
<li><span>Despise not prophecies.</span></li>
<li><span>But prove all things; hold fast that which is
good.</span></li>
<li><span>From all appearance of evil refrain
yourselves.</span></li>
<li><span>And may the God of peace himself sanctify you in all
things; that your whole spirit, and soul, and body, may be
preserved blameless in the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>He is faithful who hath called you, who also will do
it.</span></li>
<li><span>Brethren, pray for us.</span></li>
<li><span>Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.</span></li>
<li><span>I charge you by the Lord, that this epistle be read to
all the holy brethren.</span></li>
<li><span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
Amen.</span></li>
