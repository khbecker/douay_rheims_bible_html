I have brought up children, and exalted them: but they have despised me.<li>The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel hath not known me, and my people hath not understood.<li>Woe to the sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a wicked seed, ungracious children: they have forsaken the Lord, they have blasphemed the Holy One of Israel, they are gone away backwards.<li>For what shall I strike you any more, you that increase transgression? the whole head is sick, and the whole heart is sad.<li>From the sole of the foot unto the top of the head, there is no soundness therein: wounds and bruises and swelling sores: they are not bound up, nor dressed, nor fomented with oil.<li>Your land is desolate, your cities are burnt with fire: your country strangers devour before your face, and it shall be desolate as when wasted by enemies.<li>And the daughter of Sion shall be left as a covert in a vineyard, and as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, and as a city that is laid waste.<li>Except the Lord of hosts had left us seed, we had been as Sodom, and we should have been like to Gomorrha.<li>Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom, give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrha.<li>To what purpose do you offer me the multitude of your victims, saith the Lord? I am full, I desire not holocausts of rams, and fat of fatlings, and blood of calves, and lambs, and buck goats.<li>When you came to appear before me, who required these things at your hands, that you should walk in my courts?<li>Offer sacrifice no more in vain: incense is an abomination tome. The new moons, and the sabbaths, and other festivals I will not abide, your assemblies are wicked.<li>My soul hateth your new moons, and your solemnities: they are become troublesome to me, I am weary of bearing them.<li>And when you stretch forth your hands, I will turn away my eyes from you: and when you multiply prayer, I will not hear: for your hands are full of blood.<li>Wash yourselves, be clean, take away the evil of your devices from my eyes: cease to do perversely,<li>Learn to do well: seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge for the fatherless, defend the widow.<li>And then come, and accuse me, saith the Lord: if your sins be as scarlet, they shall be made as white as snow: and if they be red as crimson, they shall be white as wool.<li>if you be willing, and will hearken to me, you shall eat the good things of the land.<li>But if you will not, and will provoke me to wrath: the sword shall devour you because the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.<li>How is the faithful city, that was full of judgment, become a harlot? justice dwelt in it, but now murderers.<li>Thy silver is turned into dress: thy wine is mingled with water.<li>Thy princes are faithless, companions of thieves: they all love bribes, the run after rewards. They judge not for the fatherless: and the widow's cometh not in to them.<li>Therefore saith the Lord the God of hosts, the mighty one of Israel: Ah! I will comfort myself over my adversaries: and I will be revenged of my enemies.<li>And I will turn my hand to thee, and I will clean purge away thy dress, and I will take away all thy tin.<li>And I will restore thy judges se they were before, and thy counsellors as of old. After this thou shalt be called the city of the just, a faithful city.<li>Sion shall be redeemed in judgment, and they shall bring her back in justice.<li>And he shall destroy the wicked, and the sinners together: and they that have forsaken the Lord, shall be consumed.<li>For they shall be confounded for the idols, to which they have sacrificed: and you shall be ashamed of the gardens which you have chosen.<li>When you shall be as an oak with the leaves falling off, and as a garden without water.<li>And your strength shall be as the ashes of tow, and your work as a spark: and both shall burn together, and there shall be none to quench it.</ol><h2><a name=2>Isaias 2</a></h2><ol><li>The word that Isaias the son of Amos saw, concerning Juda and Jerusalem.<li>And in the last days the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be prepared on the top of mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills, and all nations shall flow unto it.<li>And many people shall go, and say: Come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall come forth from Sion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.<li>And he shall judge the Gentiles, and rebuke many people: and they shall turn their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into sickles: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they be exercised any more to war.<li>O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord.<li>For thou hast cast off thy people, the house of Jacob: because they are filled as in times past, and have had soothsayers as the Philistines, and have adhered to strange children.<li>Their land is filled with silver and gold: and there is no end of their treasures.<li>And their land is filled with horses: and their chariots are innumerable. Their land also is full of idols: they have adored the work of their own hands, which their own fingers have made.<li>And man hath bowed himself down, and man hath been debased: therefore forgive them not.<li>Enter thou into the rock, and hide thee in the pit from the face of the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty.<li>The lofty eyes of man are humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be made to stoop: and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.<li>Because the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and highminded, and upon every one that is arrogant, and he shall be humbled.<li>And upon all the tall and lofty cedars of Libanus, and upon all the oaks of Basan.<li>And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the elevated hills.<li>And upon every high tower, and every fenced wall.<li>And upon all the ships of Tharsis, and upon all that is fair to behold.<li>And the loftiness of men shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be humbled, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.<li>And idols shall be utterly destroyed.<li>And they shall go into the holes of rocks, and into the caves of the earth from the face of the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty, when he shall rise up to strike the earth.<li>In that day a man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which he had made for himself to adore, moles and bats.<li>And he shall go into the clefts of rocks, and into the holes of stones from the face of the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty, when he shall rise up to strike the earth.<li>Cease ye therefore from the man, whose breath is in his nostrils, for he is reputed high.</ol><h2><a name=3>Isaias 3</a></h2><ol><li>For behold the sovereign the Lord of hosts shall take away from Jerusalem, and from Juda the valiant and the strong, the whole strength of bread, and the whole strength of water.<li>The strong man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the cunning man, and the ancient.<li>The captain over fifty, and the honourable in countenance, and the counsellor, and the architect, and the skilful in eloquent speech.<li>And I will give children to be their princes, and the effeminate shall rule over them.<li>And the people shall rush one upon another, and every man against his neighbour: the child shall make it tumult against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.<li>For a man shall take hold or his brother, one of the house of his father, saying: Thou hast a garment, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand.<li>In that day he shall answer, saying: I am no healer, and in my house there is no bread, nor clothing: make me not ruler of the people.<li>For Jerusalem is ruined, and Juda is fallen: because their tongue, and their devices are against the Lord, to provoke the eyes of his majesty.<li>The shew of their countenance hath answered them: and they have proclaimed abroad their sin as Sodom, and they have not hid it: woe to their souls, for evils are rendered to them.<li>Say to the just man that it is well, for he shall eat the fruit of his doings.<li>Woe to the wicked unto evil: for the reward of his hands shall be given him.<li>As for my people, their oppressors have stripped them, and women have ruled over them. O my people, they that call thee blessed, the same deceive thee, and destroy the way of thy steps.<li>The Lord standeth up to judge, and he standeth to judge the people.<li>The Lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and its princes: for you have devoured the vineyard, and the spoil of the poor is in your house.<li>Why do you consume my people, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord the God of hosts.<li>And the Lord said: Because the daughters of Sion are haughty, and have walked with stretched out necks, and wanton glances of their eyes, and made a noise as they walked with their feet and moved in a set pace:<li>The Lord will make bald the crown of the head of the daughters of Sion, and the Lord will discover their hair.<li>In that day the Lord will take away the ornaments of shoes, end little moons,<li>And chains and necklaces, and bracelets, and bonnets,<li>And bodkins, and ornaments of the legs, and tablets, and sweet balls, and earrings,<li>And rings, and jewels hanging on the forehead,<li>And changes of apparel, and short cloaks, and fine linen, and crisping pins,<li>And looking-glasses, and lawns, and headbands, and fine veils.<li>And instead of a sweet smell there shall be stench, and instead of a girdle, a cord, and instead of curled hair, baldness, and instead of a stomacher, haircloth.<li>Thy fairest men also shall fall by the sword, and thy valiant ones in battle.<li>And her gates shall lament and mourn, and she shall sit desolate on the ground.</ol><h2><a name=4>Isaias 4</a></h2><ol><li>And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying: We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, take away our reproach.<li>In that day the bud of the Lord shall be in magnificence and glory, and the fruit of the earth shall be high, and a great joy to them that shall have escaped of Israel.<li>And it shall come to pass, that every one that shall be left in Sion, and that shall remain in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, every one that is written in life in Jerusalem.<li>If the Lord shall wash away the filth of the daughters of Sion, and shall wash away the blood of Jerusalem out of the midst thereof, by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning.<li>And the Lord will create upon every place of mount Sion, and where he is called upon, a cloud by day, and a smoke and the brightness of a flaming fire in the night: for over all the glory shall be a protection.<li>And there shall be a tabernacle for a shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a security and covert from the whirlwind, and from rain.</ol><h2><a name=5>Isaias 5</a></h2><ol><li>For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one little measure, and thirty bushels of seed shall yield three bushels.<li>Woe to you that rise up early in the morning to follow drunkenness, and to drink till the evening, to be inflamed with wine.<li>The harp, and the lyre, and the timbrel, and the pipe, and wine are in your feasts: and the work of the Lord you regard not, nor do you consider the works of his hands.<li>Therefore is my people led away captive, because they had not knowledge, and their nobles have perished with famine, and their multitude were dried up with thirst.<li>Therefore hath hell enlarged her soul, and opened her mouth without any bounds, and their strong ones, and their people, and their high and glorious ones shall go down into it.<li>And man shall be brought down, and man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be brought low.<li>And the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and the holy God shall be sanctified in justice.<li>And the lambs shall feed according to their order, and strangers shall eat the deserts turned into fruitfulness.<li>Woe to you that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as the rope of a cart.<li>That say: Let him make haste, and let his work come quickly, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel come, that we may know it.<li>Woe to you that call evil good, and good evil: that put darkness for light, and light for darkness: that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter.<li>Woe to you that rue wise in your own eyes, and prudent in your own conceits.<li>Woe to you that are mighty to drink wine, and stout men at drunkenness.<li>That justify the wicked for gifts, and take away the justice of the just from him.<li>Therefore as the tongue of the fire devoureth the stubble, and the heat of the dame consumeth it: so shall their root be as ashes, and their bud shall go up se dust: for they have cast away the law of the Lord of hosts, and have blasphemed the word of the Holy One of Israel.<li>Therefore is the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people, and he hath stretched out his hand upon them, and struck them: and the mountains were troubled, and their carcasses became as dung in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.<li>And he will lift up a sign to the nations afar off, and will whistle to them from the ends of the earth: and behold they shall come with speed swiftly.<li>There is none that shall faint, nor labour among them: they shall not slumber nor sleep, neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken.<li>Their arrows are sharp, and all their bows are bent. The hoofs of their horses shall be like the hint, and their wheels like the violence of a tempest.<li>Their roaring like that of a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea they shall roar, and take hold of the prey, and they shall keep fast hold of it, and there shall be none to deliver it.<li>And they shall make a noise against them that day, like the roaring of the sea; we shall look towards the land, and behold darkness of tribulation, and the light is darkened with the mist thereof.</ol><h2><a name=6>Isaias 6</a></h2><ol><li>In the year that king Ozias died, I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and elevated: and his train filled the temple.<li>Upon it stood the seraphims: the one had six wings, and the other had six wings: with two they covered his face, and with two they covered his feet, and with two they hew.<li>And they cried one to another, and said: Holy, holy, holy, the Lord God of hosts, all the earth is full of his glory.<li>And the lintels of the doors were moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.<li>And I said: Woe is me, because I have held my peace; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people that hath unclean lips, and I have seen with my eyes the King the Lord of hosts.<li>And one of the seraphims flew to me, and in his hand was a live coal, which he had taken with the tongs off the altar.<li>And he touched my mouth, and said: Behold this hath touched thy lips, and thy iniquities shall be taken away, and thy sin shall be cleansed.<li>And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: Whom shall I send? and who shall go for us? And I said: Lo, here am I, send me.<li>And he said: Go, and thou shalt say to this people: Hearing, hear, and understand not: and see the vision, and know it not.<li>Blind the heart of this people, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes: lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted and I heal them.<li>And I said: How long, O Lord? And he said: Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land shall be left desolate.<li>And the Lord shall remove men far away, and she shall be multiplied that was left in the midst of the earth.<li>And there shall be still a tithing therein, and she shall turn, and shall be made a show as a turpentine tree, and as an oak that spreadeth its branches: that which shall stand therein, shall be a holy seed.</ol><h2><a name=7>Isaias 7</a></h2><ol><li>And it came to pass in the days of Achaz the son of Joathan, the son of Ozias, king of Juda, that Basin king of Syria, and Phacee the son of Romelia king of Israel, came up to Jerusalem, to fight against it: but they could not prevail over it.<li>And they told the house of David, saying: Syria hath rested upon Ephraim, and his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the woods are moved with the wind.<li>And the Lord said to Isaias: Go forth to meet Achaz, thou and Jasub thy son that is left, to the conduit of the upper pool, a in the way of the fuller's held.<li>And thou shalt say to him: See thou be quiet: fear not, and let not thy heart be afraid of the two tails of these fire brands, smoking with the wrath of the fury of Rasin king of Syria, end of the son of Romelia.<li>Because Syria hath taken counsel against thee, unto the evil of Ephraim and the son of Romelia, saying:<li>Let us go up to Juda, and rouse it up, and draw it away to us, and make the son of Tabeel king in the midst thereof.<li>Thus saith the Lord God: It shall not stand, and this shall not be.<li>But the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Basin: and within threescore and five years, Ephraim shall cease to be a people:<li>And the head of Ephraim is Samaria and the head of Samaria the son of Romelia. If you will not believe, you shall not continue.<li>And the Lord spoke again to Achaz, saying:<li>Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God either unto the depth of hell, or unto the height above.<li>And Achaz said: I will not ask, and I will not tempt the Lord.<li>And he said: Hear ye therefore, O house of David: Is it a small thing for you to be grievous to men, that you are grievous to my God also?<li>Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign. Behold a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and his name shall be called Emmanuel.<li>He shall eat butter and honey, that he may know to refuse the evil, and to choose the good.<li>For before the child know to refuse the evil, and to choose the good, the land which thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of the face of her two kings.<li>The Lord shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon the house of thy father, days that have not come since the time of the separation of Ephraim from Juda with the king of the Assyrians.<li>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall hiss for the fly, that is in the uttermost parts of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.<li>And they shall come, and shall all of them rest in the torrents of the valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all places set with shrubs, and in all hollow places.<li>In that day the Lord shall shave with a razor that is hired by them that are beyond the river, by the king of the Assyrians, the head and the hairs of the feet, and the whole beard.<li>And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep.<li>And for the abundance of milk he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that shall be left in the midst of the land.<li>And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place where there were a thousand vines, at a thousand pieces of silver, shall become thorns and briers.<li>With arrows and with bows they shall go in thither: for briars and thorns shall be in all the land.<li>And as for all the hills that shall be raked with a rake, the fear of thorns and briers shall not come thither, but they shall be for the ox to feed on, and the lesser cattle to tread upon.</ol><h2><a name=8>Isaias 8</a></h2><ol><li>And the Lord said to me: Take thee a great book, and write in it with a man's pen. Take sway the spoils with speed, quickly take the prey.<li>And I took unto me faithful witnesses, Urias the priest, and Zacharias the son of Barachias.<li>And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived, and bore a son. And the Lord said to me: Call his name, Hasten to take away the spoils: Make haste to take away the prey.<li>For before the child know to call his father and his mother, the strength of Damascus, and the spoils of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of the Assyrians.<li>And the Lord spoke to me again, saying:<li>Forasmuch as this people hath cast away the waters of Siloe, that go with silence, and hath rather taken Basin, and the son of Romelia:<li>Therefore behold the Lord will bring upon them the waters of the river strong and many, the king of the Assyrians, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and shall overflow all his banks,<li>And shall pass through Juda, overflowing, and going over shall reach even to the neck. And the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Emmanuel.<li>Gather yourselves together, O ye people, and be overcome, and give ear, all ye lands afar off: strengthen yourselves, end be overcome, gird yourselves, and be overcome.<li>Take counsel together, and it shall be defeated: speak a word, and it shall not be done: because God is with us.<li>For thus saith the Lord to me: As he hath taught me, with a strong arm, that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying:<li>Say ye not: A conspiracy: for all that this people speaketh, is a conspiracy: neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.<li>Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself: and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.<li>And he shall be a sanctification to you. But for a stone or stumbling, and for a rock of offence to the two houses of Israel, for a snare and a ruin to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.<li>And very many of them shall stumble and fall, and shall be broken in pieces, and shall be snared, and taken.<li>Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.<li>And I will wait for the Lord, who hath hid his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.<li>Behold I and my children, whom the Lord hath given me for a sign, and for a wonder in Israel from the Lord of hosts, who dwelleth in mount Sion.<li>And when they shall say to you: Seek of pythons, and of diviners, who mutter in their enchantments: should not the people seek of their God, for the living of the dead?<li>To the law rather, and to the testimony. And if they speak not according to this word, they shall not have the morning light.<li>And they shall pass by it, they shall fall, and be hungry: and when they shall be hungry, they will be angry, and curse their king, and their God, and look upwards.<li>And they shall look to the earth, and behold trouble and darkness, weakness and distress, and a mist following them, and they cannot fly away from their distress.</ol><h2><a name=9>Isaias 9</a></h2><ol><li>At the first time the land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephtali was lightly touched: and at the last the way of the sea beyond the Jordan of the Galilee of the Gentiles was heavily loaded.<li>The people that walked in darkness, have seen a great light: to them that dwelt in the region of the shadow of death, light is risen.<li>Thou hast multiplied the nation, and hast not increased the joy.
