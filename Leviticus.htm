<ol>
<li><span>And the Lord called Moses, and spoke to him from the
tabernacle of the testimony, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to
them: The man among you that shall offer to the Lord a sacrifice of
the cattle, that is, offering victims of oxen and
sheep,</span></li>
<li><span>If his offering be a holocaust, and of the herd, he shall
offer a male without blemish, at the door of the testimony, to make
the Lord favourable to him:</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall put his hand upon the head of the victim,
and it shall be acceptable, and help to its expiation.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall immolate the calf before the Lord, and the
priests the sons of Aaron shall offer the blood thereof, pouring it
round about the altar, which is before the door of the
tabernacle.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they have flayed the victim, they shall cut the
joints into pieces,</span></li>
<li><span>And shall put fire on the altar, having before laid in
order a pile of wood:</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall lay the parts that are cut out in order
thereupon, to wit, the head, and all things that cleave to the
liver,</span></li>
<li><span>The entrails and feet being washed with water: and the
priest shall burn them upon the altar for a holocaust, and a sweet
savour to the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And if the offering be of the hocks, a holocaust of sheep
or of goats, he shall offer a male without blemish:</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall immolate it at the side of the altar that
looketh to the north, before the Lord: but the sons of Aaron shall
pour the blood thereof upon the altar round about:</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall divide the joints, the head, and all that
cleave to the liver: and shall lay them upon the wood, under which
the fire is to be put:</span></li>
<li><span>But the entrails and the feet they shall wash with water.
And the priest shall offer it all and burn it all upon the altar
for a holocaust, and most sweet savour to the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>But if the oblation of a holocaust to the Lord be of
birds, of turtles, or of young pigeons,</span></li>
<li><span>The priest shall offer it at the altar: and twisting back
the neck, and breaking the place of the wound, he shall make the
blood run down upon the brim of the altar.</span></li>
<li><span>But the crop of the throat, and the feathers he shall
cast beside the altar at the east side, in the place where the
ashes are wont to be poured out,</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall break the pinions thereof, and shall not
cut, nor divide it with a knife, and shall burn it upon the altar,
putting fire under the wood. It is a holocaust and oblation of most
sweet savour to the Lord.</span></li>

<li><span>When any one shall offer an oblation of sacrifice to the
Lord, his offering shall be of fine flour, and he shall pour oil
upon it, and put frankincense,</span></li>
<li><span>And shall bring it to the sons of Aaron the priests: and
one of them shall take a handful of the flour and oil, and all the
frankincense, and shall put it a memorial upon the altar for a most
sweet savour to the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And the remnant of the sacrifice shall be Aaron's, and
his sons', holy of holies of the offerings of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>But when thou offerest a sacrifice baked in the oven of
flour, to wit, loaves without leaven, tempered with oil, and
unleavened wafers, anointed with oil:</span></li>
<li><span>If thy oblation be from the fryingpan, of flour tempered
with oil, and without leaven,</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt divide it into little pieces, and shalt pour
oil upon it.</span></li>
<li><span>And if the sacrifice be from the gridiron, in like manner
the flour shall be tempered with oil:</span></li>
<li><span>And when thou offerest it to the Lord, thou shalt deliver
it to the hands of the priest.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he hath offered it, he shall take a memorial out
of the sacrifice, and burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour to
the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And whatsoever is left, shall be Aaron's, and his sons',
holy of holies of the offerings of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Every oblation that is offered to the Lord shall be made
without leaven, neither shall any leaven or honey be burnt in the
sacrifice to the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>You shall offer only the firstfruits of them and gifts:
but they shall not be put upon the altar, for a savour of
sweetness,</span></li>
<li><span>Whatsoever sacrifice thou offerest, thou shalt season it
with salt, neither shalt thou take away the salt of the covenant of
thy God from thy sacrifice. In all thy oblations thou shalt offer
salt.</span></li>
<li><span>But if thou offer a gift of the firstfruits of thy corn
to the Lord, of the ears yet green, thou shalt dry it at the fire,
and break it small like meal, and so shalt thou offer thy
firstfruits to the Lord,</span></li>
<li><span>Pouring oil upon it and putting on frankincense, because
it is the oblation of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Whereof the priest shall burn for a memorial of the gift,
part of the corn broken small and of the oil, and all the
frankincense. h</span></li>

<li><span>And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offerings,

offer them without blemish before the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his victim,
which shall be slain in the entry of the tabernacle of the
testimony, and the sons of Aaron the priests shall pour the blood
round about upon the altar.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall offer of the sacrifice of peace offerings,
for an oblation to the Lord, the fat that covereth the entrails,
and all the fat that is within.</span></li>
<li><span>The two kidneys with the fat wherewith the flanks are
covered, and the caul of the liver with the two little
kidneys.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall burn them upon the altar, for a holocaust,
putting fire under the wood: for an oblation of most sweet savour

be of the flock, whether he offer male or female, they shall be
without blemish.</span></li>

sacrifice to the Lord: the fat and the whole rump,</span></li>

all the vitals and both the little kidneys, with the fat that is
about the flanks, and the caul of the liver with the little
kidneys.</span></li>

food of the fire, and of the oblation of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>If his offering be a goat, and he offer it to the
Lord,</span></li>

which is by the flanks, and the fat of the liver with the little

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="4">Leviticus 4</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Say to the children of Israel: The soul that sinneth
through ignorance, and doth any thing concerning any of the
commandments of the Lord, which he commanded not to be
done:</span></li>
<li><span>If the priest that is anointed shall sin, making the
people to offend, he shall offer to the Lord for his sin a calf
without blemish.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall bring it to the door of the testimony before
the Lord, and shall put his hand upon the head thereof, and shall
sacrifice it to the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>He shall take also of the blood of the calf, and carry it
into the tabernacle of the testimony.</span></li>
<li><span>And having dipped his finger in the blood, he shall
sprinkle with it seven times before the Lord, before the veil of
the sanctuary.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall put some of the same blood upon the horns of
the altar of the sweet incense most acceptable to the Lord, which
is in the tabernacle of the testimony. And he shall pour all the
rest of the blood at the foot of the altar of holocaust in the
entry of the tabernacle.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall take off the fat of the calf for the sin
offering, as well that which covereth the entrails, as all the
inwards:</span></li>
<li><span>The two little kidneys, and the caul that is upon them,
which is by the hanks, and the fat of the liver with the little
kidneys,</span></li>
<li><span>As it is taken off from the calf of the sacrifice of
peace offerings, and he shall burn them upon the altar of
holocaust.</span></li>
<li><span>But the skin and all the flesh with the head and the feet
and the bowels and the dung,</span></li>
<li><span>And the rest of the body he shall carry forth without the
camp into a clean place where the ashes are wont to be poured out,
and he shall burn them upon a pile of wood, they shall be burnt in
the place where the ashes are poured out.</span></li>
<li><span>And if all the multitude of Israel shall be ignorant, and
through ignorance shall do that which is against the commandment of
the Lord,</span></li>
<li><span>And afterwards shall understand their sin, they shall
offer for their sin a calf, and shall bring it to the door of the
tabernacle.</span></li>
<li><span>And the ancients of the people shall put their hands upon
the head thereof before the Lord. And the calf being immolated in
the sight of the Lord,</span></li>
<li><span>The priest that is anointed shall carry of the blood into
the tabernacle of the testimony.</span></li>
<li><span>And shall dip his finger in it and sprinkle it seven
times before the veil.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall put of the same blood on the horns of the
altar that is before the Lord, in the tabernacle of the testimony:
and the rest of the blood he shall pour at the foot of the altar of
holocaust, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the
testimony.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the fat thereof he shall take off, and shall burn
it upon the altar:</span></li>
<li><span>Doing so with this calf, as he did also with that before:
and the priest praying for them, the Lord will be merciful unto
them.</span></li>
<li><span>But the calf itself he shall carry forth without the
camp, and shall burn it as he did the former calf: because it is
for the sin of the multitude.</span></li>
<li><span>If a prince shall sin, and through ignorance do any one
of the things that the law of the Lord forbiddeth,</span></li>
<li><span>And afterwards shall come to know his sin, he shall offer
a buck goat without blemish, a sacrifice to the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall put his hand upon the head thereof: and when
he hath immolated it in the place where the holocaust is wont to be
slain before the Lord, because it is for sin,</span></li>
<li><span>The priest shall dip his finger in the blood of the
victim for sin, touching therewith the horns of the altar of
holocaust, and pouring out the rest at the foot
thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>But the fat he shall burn upon it, as is wont to be done
with the victims of peace offerings: and the priest shall pray for
him, and for his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.</span></li>
<li><span>And if any one of the people of the land shall sin
through ignorance, doing any of those things that by the law of the
Lord are forbidden, and offending,</span></li>
<li><span>And shall come to know his sin, he shall offer a she goat
without blemish.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall put his hand upon the head of the victim
that is for sin, and shall immolate it in the place of the
holocaust.</span></li>
<li><span>And the priest shall take of the blood with his finger,
and shall touch the horns of the altar of holocaust, and shall pour
out the rest at the foot thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>But taking off all the fat, as is wont to be taken away
of the victims of peace offerings, he shall burn it upon the altar,
for a sweet savour to the Lord: and he shall pray for him, and it
shall be forgiven him.</span></li>
<li><span>But if he offer of the flock a victim for his sin, to
wit, an ewe without blemish:</span></li>
<li><span>He shall put his hand upon the head thereof, and shall
immolate it in the place where the victims of holocausts are wont
to be slain.</span></li>
<li><span>And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his
finger, and shall touch the horns of the altar of holocaust, and
the rest he shall pour out at the foot thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>All the fat also he shall take off, as the fat of the ram
that is offered for peace offerings is wont to be taken away: and
shall burn it upon the altar, for a burnt sacrifice of the Lord:
and he shall pray for him and for his sin, and it shall be forgiven
him.</span></li>

<li><span>If any one sin, and hear the voice of one swearing, and
is a witness either because he himself hath seen, or is privy to
it: if he do not utter it, he shall bear his iniquity.</span></li>
<li><span>Whosoever toucheth any unclean thing, either that which
hath been killed by a beast, or died of itself, or any other
creeping thing: and forgetteth his uncleanness, he is guilty, and
hath offended:</span></li>
<li><span>And if he touch any thing of the uncleanness of man,
according to any uncleanness wherewith he is wont to be defiled,
and having forgotten it, come afterwards to know it, he shall be
guilty of an offence.</span></li>
<li><span>The person that sweareth, and uttereth with his lips,
that he would do either evil or good, and bindeth the same with an
oath, and his word, and having forgotten it afterwards
understandeth his offence,</span></li>
<li><span>Let him do penance for his sin,</span></li>
<li><span>And offer of the flocks an ewe lamb, or a she goat, and
the priest shall pray for him and for his sin:</span></li>
<li><span>But if he be not able to offer a beast, let him offer two
turtles, or two young pigeons to the Lord, one for sin, and the
other for a holocaust,</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall give them to the priest: who shall offer the
first for sin, and twist back the head of it to the little pinions,
so that it stick to the neck, and be not altogether broken
off.</span></li>
<li><span>And of its blood he shall sprinkle the side of the altar,
and whatsoever is left, he shall let it drop at the bottom thereof,
because it is for sin.</span></li>
<li><span>And the other he shall burn for a holocaust, as is wont
to be done: and the priest shall pray for him, and for his sin, and
it shall be forgiven him.</span></li>
<li><span>And if his hand be not able to offer two turtles, or two
young pigeons, he shall offer for his sin the tenth part of an ephi
of flour. He shall not put oil upon it, nor put any frankincense
thereon, because it is for sin:</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall deliver it to the priest: who shall take a
handful thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar for a memorial of
him that offered it:</span></li>
<li><span>Praying for him and making atonement: but the part that
is left, he himself shall have for a gift.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>If any one shall sin through mistake, transgressing the
ceremonies in those things that are sacrificed to the Lord, he
shall offer for his offence a ram without blemish out of the
flocks, that may be bought for two sicles, according to the weight
of the sanctuary:</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall make good the damage itself which he hath
done, and shall add the fifth part besides, delivering it to the
priest, who shall pray for him, offering the ram, and it shall be
forgiven him.</span></li>
<li><span>If any one sin through ignorance, and do one of those
things which by the law of the Lord are forbidden, and being guilty
of sin, understand his iniquity,</span></li>
<li><span>He shall offer of the hocks a ram without blemish to the
priest, according to the measure and estimation of the sin: and the
priest shall pray for him, because he did it ignorantly: and it
shall be forgiven him,</span></li>

Lord.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="6">Leviticus 6</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Whosoever shall sin, and despising the Lord, shall deny
to his neighbour the thing delivered to his keeping, which was
committed to his trust; or shall by force extort any thing, or
commit oppression;</span></li>
<li><span>Or shall find a thing lost, and denying it, shall also
swear falsely, or shall do any other of the many things, wherein
men are wont to sin:</span></li>
<li><span>Being convicted of the offence, he shall
restore</span></li>
<li><span>All that he would have gotten by fraud, in the principal,
and the fifth part besides to the owner, whom he
wronged.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover for his sin he shall offer a ram without blemish
out of the flock, and shall give it to the priest, according to the
estimation and measure of the offence:</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall pray for him before the Lord, and he shall
have forgiveness for every thing in doing of which he hath
sinned.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Command Aaron and his sons: This is the law of a
holocaust: It shall be burnt upon the altar, all night until
morning: the fire shall be of the same altar.</span></li>
<li><span>The priest shall be vested with the tunick and the linen
breeches, and he shall take up the ashes of that which the
devouring fire hath burnt, and putting them beside the
altar,</span></li>
<li><span>Shall put off his former vestments, and being clothed
with others, shall carry them forth without the camp, and shall
cause them to be consumed to dust in a very clean
place,</span></li>
<li><span>And the fire on the altar shall always burn, and the
priest shall feed it, putting wood on it every day in the morning,
and laying on the holocaust, shall burn thereupon the fat of the
peace offerings.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the perpetual fire which shall never go out on
the altar.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the law of the sacrifice and libations, which the
children of Aaron shall offer before the Lord, and before the
altar.</span></li>
<li><span>The priest shall take a handful of the flour that is
tempered with oil, and all the frankincense that is put upon the
flour: and he shall burn it on the altar for a memorial of most
sweet odour to the Lord:</span></li>
<li><span>And the part of the flour that is left, Aaron and his
sons shall eat, without leaven: and he shall eat it in the holy
place of the court of the tabernacle.</span></li>
<li><span>And therefore it shall not be leavened, because part
thereof is offered for the burnt sacrifice of the Lord. It shall be
most holy, as that which is offered for sin and for
trespass.</span></li>
<li><span>The males only of the race of Aaron shall eat it. It
shall be an ordinance everlasting in your generations concerning
the sacrifices of the Lord: Every one that toucheth them shall be
sanctified.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>This is the oblation of Aaron, and of his sons, which
they must offer to the Lord, in the day of their anointing: They
shall offer the tenth part of an ephi of flour for a perpetual
sacrifice, half of it in the morning, and half of it in the
evening:</span></li>
<li><span>It shall be tempered with oil, and shall be fried in a
fryingpan.</span></li>
<li><span>And the priest that rightfully succeedeth his father,
shall offer it hot, for a most sweet odour to the Lord, and it
shall be wholly burnt on the altar.</span></li>
<li><span>For every sacrifice of the priest shall be consumed with
fire, neither shall any man eat thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Say to Aaron and his sons: This is the law of the victim
for sin: in the place where the holocaust is offered, it shall be
immolated before the Lord. It is holy of holies.</span></li>
<li><span>The priest that offereth it, shall eat it in a holy
place, in the court of the tabernacle.</span></li>
<li><span>Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof, shall be
sanctified. If a garment be sprinkled with the blood thereof, it
shall be washed in a holy place.</span></li>
<li><span>And the earthen vessel, wherein it was sodden, shall be
broken, but if the vessel be of brass, it shall be scoured, and
washed with water.</span></li>
<li><span>Every male of the priestly race shall eat of the flesh
thereof, because it is holy of holies.</span></li>
<li><span>For the victim that is slain for sin, the blood of which
is carried into the tabernacle of the testimony to make atonement
in the sanctuary, shall not be eaten, but shall be burnt with
fire.</span></li>

<li><span>This also is the law of the sacrifice for a trespass, it
is most holy:</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore where the holocaust is immolated, the victim
also for a trespass shall be slain: the blood thereof shall be
poured round about the altar.</span></li>
<li><span>They shall offer thereof the rump and the fat that
covereth the entrails:</span></li>
<li><span>The two little kidneys, and the fat which is by the
flanks, and the caul of the liver with the little
kidneys.</span></li>
<li><span>And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the
burnt sacrifice of the Lord for a trespass.</span></li>
<li><span>Every male of the priestly race, shall eat this flesh in
a holy place, because it is most holy.</span></li>
<li><span>As the sacrifice for sin is offered, so is also that for

have the skin thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>And every sacrifice of flour that is baked in the oven,

<li><span>Whether they be tempered with oil, or dry, all the sons
of Aaron shall have one as much as another.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings that
is offered to the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>If the oblation be for thanksgiving, they shall offer
leaves without leaven tempered with oil, and unleavened wafers
anointed with oil, and fine flour fried, and cakes tempered and
mingled with oil:</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover leaves of leavened bread with the sacrifice of
thanks, which is offered for peace offerings:</span></li>
<li><span>Of which one shall be offered to the Lord for
firstfruits, and shall be the priest's that shall pour out the
blood of the victim.</span></li>
<li><span>And the flesh of it shall be eaten the same day, neither
shall any of it remain until the morning.</span></li>
<li><span>If any man by vow, or of his own accord offer a
sacrifice, it shall in like manner be eaten the same day: and if
any of it remain until the morrow, it is lawful to eat
it:</span></li>
<li><span>But whatsoever shall be found on the third day shall be
consumed with fire.</span></li>
<li><span>If any man eat of the flesh of the victim of peace
offerings on the third day, the oblation shall be of no effect,
neither shall it profit the offerer: yea rather whatsoever soul
shall defile itself with such meat, shall be guilty of
transgression.</span></li>
<li><span>The flesh that hath touched any unclean thing, shall not
be eaten, but shall be burnt with fire: he that is clean shall eat
of it.</span></li>
<li><span>If any one that is defiled shall eat of the flesh of the
sacrifice of peace offerings, which is offered to the Lord, he
shall be cut off from his people.</span></li>
<li><span>And he that hath touched the uncleanness of man, or of
beast, or of any thing that can defile, and shall eat of such kind
of flesh, shall be cut off from his people.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Say to the children of Israel: The fat of a sheep, and of
an ox, and of a goat you shall not eat.</span></li>
<li><span>The fat of a carcass that hath died of itself, and of a
beast that was caught by another beast, you shall have for divers
uses.</span></li>
<li><span>If any man eat the fat that should be offered for the
burnt sacrifice of the Lord, he shall perish out of his
people.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover you shall not eat the blood of any creature
whatsoever, whether of birds or beasts.</span></li>
<li><span>Every one that eateth blood, shall perish from among the
people.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Speak to the children of Israel, saying: He that offereth
a victim of peace offerings to the Lord, let him offer therewith a
sacrifice also, that is, the libations thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>He shall hold in his hands the fat of the victim, and the
breast: and when he hath offered and consecrated both to the Lord,
he shall deliver them to the priest,</span></li>
<li><span>Who shall burn the fat upon the altar, but the breast
shall be Aaron's and his sons'.</span></li>
<li><span>The right shoulder also of the victims of peace offerings
shall fall to the priest for firstfruits.</span></li>
<li><span>He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood, and
the fat, he shall have the right shoulder also for his
portion.</span></li>
<li><span>For the breast that is elevated and the shoulder that is
separated I have taken of the children of Israel, from off their
victims of peace offerings, and have given them to Aaron the
priest, and to his sons, by a law for ever, from all the people of
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the anointing of Aaron and his sons, in the
ceremonies of the Lord, in the day when Moses offered them, that
they might do the office of priesthood,</span></li>
<li><span>And the things that the Lord commanded to be given them
by the children of Israel, by a perpetual observance in their
generations.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the law of holocaust, and of the sacrifice for
sin, and for trespass, and for consecration, and the victims of
peace offerings:</span></li>
<li><span>Which the Lord appointed to Moses in mount Sinai, when he
commanded the children of Israel, that they should offer their
oblations to the Lord in the desert of Sinai.</span></li>

<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Take Aaron with his sons, their vestments, and the oil of
unction, a calf for sin, two rams, a basket with unleavened
bread,</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt gather together all the congregation to
the door of the tabernacle.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses did as the Lord had commanded. And all the
multitude being gathered together before the door of the
tabernacle,</span></li>
<li><span>He said: This is the word that the Lord hath commanded to
be done.</span></li>
<li><span>And immediately he offered Aaron and his sons: and when
he had washed them,</span></li>
<li><span>He vested the high priest with the strait linen garment,
girding him with the girdle, and putting on him the violet tunick,
and over it he put the ephod,</span></li>
<li><span>And binding it with the girdle, he fitted it to the
rational, on which was Doctrine and Truth.</span></li>
<li><span>He put also the mitre upon his head: and upon the mitre
over the forehead, he put the plate of gold, consecrated with
sanctification, as the Lord had commanded him.</span></li>
<li><span>He took also the oil of unction, with which he anointed
the tabernacle, with all the furniture thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he had sanctified and sprinkled the altar seven
times, he anointed it, and all the vessels thereof, and the laver
with the foot thereof, he sanctified with the oil.</span></li>
<li><span>And he poured it upon Aaron's head, and he anointed and
consecrated him :</span></li>
<li><span>And after he had offered his sons, he vested them with
linen tunicks, and girded them with girdles, and put mitres on them
as the Lord had commanded.</span></li>
<li><span>He offered also the calf for sin: and when Aaron and his
sons had put their hands upon the head thereof,</span></li>
<li><span>He immolated it: and took the blood, and dipping his
finger in it, he touched the horns of the altar round about. Which
being expiated, and sanctified, he poured the rest of the blood at
the bottom thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>But the fat that was upon the entrails, and the caul of
the liver, and the two little kidneys, with their fat, he burnt
upon the altar:</span></li>
<li><span>And the calf with the skin, and the flesh and the dung,
he burnt without the camp, as the Lord had commanded.</span></li>
<li><span>He offered also a ram for a holocaust: and when Aaron and
his sons had put their hands upon its head,</span></li>
<li><span>He immolated it, and poured the blood thereof round about
upon the altar.</span></li>
<li><span>And cutting the ram into pieces, the head thereof, and
the joints, and the fat he burnt in the fire,</span></li>
<li><span>Having first washed the entrails, and the feet, and the
whole ram together he burnt upon the altar, because it was a
holocaust of most sweet odour to the Lord, as he had commanded
him.</span></li>
<li><span>He offered also the second ram, in the consecration of
priests: and Aaron, and his sons put their hands upon the head
thereof:</span></li>
<li><span>And when Moses had immolated it, he took of the blood
thereof, and touched the tip of Aaron's right ear, and the thumb of
his right hand, and in like manner also the great toe of his right
foot.</span></li>
<li><span>He offered also the sons of Aaron: and when with the
blood of the ram that was immolated, he had touched the tip of the
right ear of every one of them, and the thumbs of their right
hands, and the great toes of their right feet, the rest he poured
on the altar round about:</span></li>
<li><span>But the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that covereth
the entrails, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys with
their fat, and with the right shoulder, he separated.</span></li>
<li><span>And taking out of the basket; of unleavened bread, which
was before the Lord, a loaf without leaven, and a cake tempered
with oil and a wafer, he put them upon the fat, and the right
shoulder,</span></li>
<li><span>Delivering all to Aaron, and to his sons: wile having
lifted them up before the Lord,</span></li>
<li><span>He took them again from their hands, and burnt them upon
the altar of holocaust, because it was the oblation of
consecration, for a sweet odour of sacrifice to the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And he took of the ram of consecration, the breast for
his portion, elevating it before the Lord, as the Lord had
commanded him.</span></li>
<li><span>And taking the ointment, and the blood that was upon the
altar, he sprinkled Aaron, and his vestments, and his sons, and
their vestments with it.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he had sanctified them in their vestments, he
commanded them, saying: Boil the flesh before the door of the
tabernacle, and there eat it. Eat ye also the loaves of
consecration, that are laid in the basket, as the Lord commanded
me, saying: Aaron and his sons shall eat them:</span></li>
<li><span>And whatsoever shall be left of the flesh and the leaves,
shall be consumed with fire.</span></li>
<li><span>And you shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle
for seven days, until the day wherein the time of your consecration
shall be expired. For in seven days the consecration is
finished:</span></li>
<li><span>As at this present it hath been done, that the rite of
the sacrifice might be accomplished.</span></li>
<li><span>Day and night shall you remain in the tabernacle
observing the watches of the Lord, lest you die: for so it hath
been commanded me.</span></li>
<li><span>And Aaron and his sons did all things which the Lord
spoke by the hand of Moses.</span></li>

<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="9">Leviticus 9</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And when the eighth day was come, Moses called Aaron and
his sons, and the ancients of Israel, and said to
Aaron:</span></li>
<li><span>Take of the herd a calf for sin, and a ram for a
holocaust, both without blemish, and offer them before the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And to the children of Israel thou shalt say: Take ye a
he goat for sin, and a calf, and a lamb, both of a year old, and
without blemish for a holocaust,</span></li>
<li><span>Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings: and
immolate them before the Lord, offering for the sacrifice of every
one of them flour tempered with oil; for to day the Lord will
appear to you.</span></li>
<li><span>They brought therefore all things that Moses had
commanded before the door of the tabernacle: where when all the
multitude stood,</span></li>
<li><span>Moses said: This is the word, which the Lord hath
commanded: do it, and his glory will appear to you.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to Aaron: Approach to the altar, and offer
sacrifice for thy sin: offer the holocaust, and pray for thyself
and for the people: and when thou hast slain the people's victim,
pray for them, as the Lord hath commanded.</span></li>
<li><span>And forthwith Aaron, approaching to the altar, immolated
the calf for his sin:</span></li>
<li><span>And his sons brought him the blood of it: and he dipped
his finger therein, and touched the horns of the altar, and poured
the rest at the foot thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>And the fat, and the little kidneys, and the caul of the
liver, which are for sin, he burnt upon the altar, as the Lord had
commanded Moses:</span></li>
<li><span>But the flesh and skins thereof he burnt with fire
without the camp.</span></li>
<li><span>He immolated also the victim of holocaust: and his sons
brought him the blood thereof, which he poured round about on the
altar.</span></li>
<li><span>And the victim being cut into pieces, they brought to him
the head and all the members, all which he burnt with fire upon the
altar,</span></li>
<li><span>Having first washed the entrails and the feet with
water.</span></li>
<li><span>Then offering for the sin of the people, he slew the he
goat: and expiating the altar,</span></li>
<li><span>He offered the holocaust:</span></li>
<li><span>Adding in the sacrifice the libations, which are offered
withal, and burning them upon the altar, besides the ceremonies of
the morning holocaust.</span></li>
<li><span>He immolated also the bullock and the ram, the peace
offerings of the people: and his sons brought him the blood, which
he poured upon the altar round about.</span></li>
<li><span>The fat also of the bullock, and the rump of the ram, and
the two little kidneys, with their fat, and the caul of the
liver,</span></li>
<li><span>They put upon the breasts. And after the fat was burnt
upon the altar,</span></li>
<li><span>Aaron separated their breasts, and the right shoulders,
elevating them before the Lord, as Moses had commanded.</span></li>
<li><span>And stretching forth his hands to the people, he blessed
them. And so the victims for sin, and the holocausts, and the peace
offerings being finished, he came down.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the
testimony, and afterwards came forth and blessed the people. And
the glory of the Lord appeared to all the multitude:</span></li>
<li><span>And behold a fire, coming forth from the Lord, devoured
the holocaust, and the fat that was upon the altar: which when the
multitude saw, they praised the Lord, falling on their
faces.</span></li>

<li><span>And Nadab and Abiu, the sons of Aaron, taking their
censers, put fire therein, and incense on it, offering before the
Lord strange fire: which was not commanded them.</span></li>
<li><span>And fire coming out from the Lord destroyed them, and
they died before the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses said to Aaron: This is what the Lord hath
spoken: I will be sanctified in them that approach to me, and I
will be glorified in the sight of all the people. And when Aaron
heard this, he held his peace.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses called Misael and Elisaphan, the sons of Oziel,
the uncle of Aaron, and said to them: Go and take away your
brethren from before the sanctuary, and carry them without the
camp.</span></li>
<li><span>And they went forthwith and took them as they lay, vested
with linen tunicks, and cast them forth, as had been commanded
them.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his
sons: Uncover not your heads, and rend not your garments, lest
perhaps you die, and indignation come upon all the congregation.
Let your brethren, and all the house of Israel, bewail the burning
which the Lord has kindled:</span></li>
<li><span>But you shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle,
otherwise you shall perish, for the oil of the holy unction is on
you. And they did all things according to the precept of
Moses.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord also said to Aaron:</span></li>
<li><span>You shall not drink wine nor any thing that may make
drunk, thou nor thy sons, when you enter into the tabernacle of the
testimony, lest you die: because it is an everlasting precept
through your generations :</span></li>
<li><span>And that you may have knowledge to discern between holy
and unholy, between unclean and clean:</span></li>
<li><span>And may teach the children of Israel all my ordinances
which the Lord hath spoken to them by the hand of
Moses.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his
sons that were left: Take the sacrifice that is remaining of the
oblation of the Lord, and eat it without leaven beside the altar,
because it is holy of holies.</span></li>
<li><span>And you shall eat it in a holy place: which is given to
thee and thy sons of the oblations of the Lord, as it hath been
commanded me.</span></li>
<li><span>The breast also that is offered, and the shoulder that is
separated, you shall eat in a most clean place, thou and thy sons,
and thy daughters with thee. For they are set aside for thee and
thy children, of the victims of peace offerings of the children of
Israel:</span></li>
<li><span>Because they have elevated before the Lord the shoulder
and the breast, and the fat that is burnt on the altar, and they
belong to thee and to thy sons by a perpetual law, as the Lord hath
commanded.</span></li>
<li><span>While these things were a doing, when Moses sought for
the buck goat, that had been offered for sin, he found it burnt:
and being angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron that
were left, he said:</span></li>
<li><span>Why did you not eat in the holy place the sacrifice for
sin, which is most holy, and given to you, that you may bear the
iniquity of the people, and may pray for them in the sight of the
Lord,</span></li>
<li><span>Especially whereas none of the blood thereof hath been
carried within the holy places, and you ought to have eaten it in
the sanctuary, as was commanded me?</span></li>
<li><span>Aaron answered: This day hath been offered the victim for
sin, and the holocaust before the Lord: and to me what thou seest
has happened: how could I eat it, or please the Lord in the
ceremonies, having a sorrowful heart?</span></li>
<li><span>Which when Moses had heard he was satisfied.</span></li>

<li><span>Whatsoever hath the hoof divided, and cheweth the cud
among the beasts, you shall eat.</span></li>
<li><span>But whatsoever cheweth indeed the cud, and hath a hoof,
but divideth it not, as the camel, and others, that you shall not
eat, but shall reckon it among the unclean.</span></li>
<li><span>The cherogrillus which cheweth the cud, but divideth not
the hoof, is unclean.</span></li>
<li><span>The hare also: for that too cheweth the cud, but divideth
not the hoof.</span></li>
<li><span>And the swine, which, though it divideth the hoof,
cheweth not the cud.</span></li>
<li><span>The flesh of these you shall not eat, nor shall you touch

colour or a blister, or as it were something shining, that is, the
stroke of the leprosy, shall be brought to Aaron the priest, or any
one of his sons.</span></li>

turned white, and the place where the leprosy appears lower than
the skin and the rest of the flesh: it is the stroke of the
leprosy, and upon his judgment he shall be separated.</span></li>
<li><span>But if there be a shining whiteness in the skin, and not
lower than the other flesh, and the hair be of the former colour,
the priest shall shut him up seven days.</span></li>

leprosy be grown no farther, and hath not spread itself in the
skin, he shall shut him up again other seven days.</span></li>
<li><span>And on the seventh day, he shall look on him: if the
leprosy be somewhat obscure, and not spread in the skin, he shall
declare him clean, because it is but a scab: and the man shall wash
his clothes, and shall be clean.</span></li>
<li><span>But if the leprosy grow again, after he was seen by the

colour in the skin, and it shall have changed the look of the hair,
and the living flesh itself shall appear:</span></li>
<li><span>It shall be judged an inveterate leprosy, and grown into
the skin. The priest therefore shall declare him unclean, and shall
not shut him up, because he is evidently unclean.</span></li>

falleth under the sight of the eyes,</span></li>

<li><span>And on the seventh day he shall view him: if the leprosy
be grown farther in the skin, he shall declare him
unclean.</span></li>
<li><span>But if the whiteness stay in its place, and be not very
clear, it is the sore of a burning, and therefore he shall be
cleansed, because it is only the scar of a burning.</span></li>
<li><span>If the leprosy break out in the head or the beard of a
man or woman, the Priest shall see them,</span></li>
<li><span>And if the place be lower than the other flesh, and the
hair yellow, and thinner than usual: he shall declare them unclean,
because it is the leprosy of the head and the beard;</span></li>
<li><span>But if he perceive the place of the spot is equal with
the flesh that is near it, and the hair black: he shall shut him up
seven days,</span></li>
<li><span>And on the seventh day he shall look upon it. If the spot
be not grown, and the hair keep its colour, and the place of the
blemish be even with the other flesh:</span></li>
<li><span>The man shall be shaven all but the place of the spot,
and he shall be shut up other seven days:</span></li>
<li><span>If on the seventh day the evil seem to have stayed in its
place, and not lower than the other flesh, he shall cleanse him,
and his clothes being washed he shall be clean.</span></li>
<li><span>But if after his cleansing the spot spread again in the
skin,</span></li>
<li><span>He shall seek no more whether the hair be turned yellow,
because he is evidently unclean.</span></li>
<li><span>But if the spot be stayed, and the hair be black, let him
know that the man is healed, and let him confidently pronounce him
clean.</span></li>
<li><span>If a whiteness appear in the skin of a man or a
woman,</span></li>
<li><span>The priest shall view them. If he find that a darkish
whiteness shineth in the skin, let him know that it is not the
leprosy, but a white blemish, and that the man is
clean.</span></li>
<li><span>The man whose hair falleth off from his head, he is bald
and clean:</span></li>
<li><span>And if the hair fall from his forehead, he is bald before
and clean.</span></li>
<li><span>But if in the bald head or in the bald forehead there be
risen a white or reddish colour,</span></li>
<li><span>And the priest perceive this, he shall condemn him
undoubtedly of leprosy which is risen in the bald part.</span></li>
<li><span>Now whosoever shall be defiled with the leprosy, and is
separated by the judgment of the priest,</span></li>
<li><span>Shall have his clothes hanging loose, his head bare, his
mouth covered with a cloth, and he shall cry out that he is defiled
and unclean.</span></li>
<li><span>All the time that he is a leper and unclean, he shall
dwell alone without the camp.</span></li>
<li><span>A woollen or linen garment that shall have the
leprosy</span></li>
<li><span>In the warp, and the woof, or a skin. or whatsoever is
made of a skin,</span></li>
<li><span>If it be infected with a white or red spot, it shall be
accounted the leprosy, and shall be shewn to the
priest.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall look upon it and shall shut it up seven
days:</span></li>
<li><span>51And on the seventh day when he looketh on it again, if
he find that it if grown, it is a Axed leprosy: he shall judge the
garment unclean, and every thing wherein it shall be
found:</span></li>
<li><span>And therefore it shall be burnt with fire.</span></li>
<li><span>But if he see that it is not grown,</span></li>
<li><span>He shall give orders, and they shall wash that part
wherein the leprosy is, and he shall shut it up other seven
days.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he shall see that the former colour is not
returned, nor yet the leprosy spread, he shall judge it unclean,
and shall burn it with fire, for the leprosy has taken hold of the
outside of the garment, or through the whole.</span></li>
<li><span>But if the place of the leprosy be somewhat dark, after
the garment is washed, he shall tear it off, and divide it from
that which is sound.</span></li>
<li><span>And if after this there appear in those places that
before were without spot, a flying and wandering leprosy: it must
be burnt with fire.</span></li>
<li><span>If it cease, he shall wash with water the parts that are
pure, the second time, and they shall be clean.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the law touching the leprosy of any woollen or
linen garment, either in the warp or woof, or any thing of skins,
how it ought to be cleansed, or pronounced unclean.</span></li>

wood, and scarlet, and hyssop.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall command one of the sparrows to be immolated
in an earthen vessel over living waters:</span></li>

that is immolated:</span></li>

And having washed again his clothes, and his body,</span></li>
<li><span>On the eighth day he shall take two lambs without

of flour tempered with oil for a sacrifice, and a sextary of oil
apart.</span></li>

holies.</span></li>
<li><span>And the priest taking of the blood of the victim that was
immolated for trespass, shall put it upon the tip of the right ear

<li><span>He whose house it is, shall go and tell the priest,
saying: It seemeth to me, that there is the plague of leprosy in my
house,</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall command, that they carry forth all things
out of the house, before he go into it, and see whether it have the
leprosy, lest all things become unclean that are in the house. And
after- wards he shall go in to view the leprosy of the
house.</span></li>
<li><span>And if he see in the walls thereof as it were little
dints, disfigured with paleness or redness, and lower than all the
rest,</span></li>
<li><span>He shall go out of the door of the house, and forthwith
shut it up seven days,</span></li>
<li><span>And returning on the seventh day, he shall look upon it.
If he find that the leprosy is spread,</span></li>
<li><span>He shall command, that the stones wherein the leprosy is,
be taken out, and cast without the city into an unclean
place:</span></li>
<li><span>And that the house be scraped on the inside round about,
and the dust of the scraping be scattered without the city into an
unclean place:</span></li>
<li><span>And that other stones be laid in the place of them that
were taken away, and the house be plastered with other
mortar.</span></li>
<li><span>But if, after the stones be taken out, and the dust
scraped off, and it be plastered with other earth,</span></li>
<li><span>The priest going in perceive that the leprosy is
returned, and the walls full of spots, it is a lasting leprosy, and
the house is unclean:</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall destroy it forthwith, and shall cast the
stones and timber thereof, and all the dust without the town into

unclean until evening,</span></li>

wash his clothes.</span></li>

not spread in the house, after it was plastered again, he shall
purify it, it being cured,</span></li>
<li><span>And for the purification thereof he shall take two
sparrows, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:</span></li>

into the field, he shall pray for the house, and it shall be

girdle, and he shall put a linen mitre upon his head: for these are
holy vestments: all which he shall put on, after he is
washed.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall receive from the whole multitude of the

ox, or a sheep, or a goat in the camp, or without the
camp,</span></li>

<li><span>No man shall approach to her that is near of kin to him,

<li><span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father, or

uncover her nakedness.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's

<li><span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy sister by

inhabitants.</span></li>
<li><span>Keep ye my ordinances and my judgments, and do not any of

stranger that sojourneth among you.</span></li>
<li><span>For all these detestable things the inhabitants of the
land have done, that; were before you, and have defiled
it.</span></li>
<li><span>Beware then, lest in like manner, it vomit you also out,
if you do the like things, as it vomited out the nation that was
before you.</span></li>
<li><span>Every soul that shall commit any of these abominations,

<li><span>But only for his kin, such as are near in blood, that is
to say, for his father and for his mother, and for his son, and for
his daughter, for his brother also,</span></li>

<li><span>Neither shall they shave their head, nor their beard, nor

<li><span>They shall be holy to their God, and shall not profane
his name: for they offer the burnt offering of the Lord, and the
bread of their God, and therefore they shall be holy.</span></li>
<li><span>They shall not take to wife a harlot or a vile
prostitute, nor one that has been put away from her husband:
because they are consecrated to their God,</span></li>

<li><span>If the daughter of a priest be taken in whoredom, and

fire.</span></li>

hath been poured, and whose hands have been consecrated for the
priesthood, and who hath been vested with the holy vestments, shall
not uncover his head, he shall not rend his garments:</span></li>
<li><span>Nor shall he go in at all to any dead person: not even
for his father, or his mother, shall he be defiled:</span></li>
<li><span>Neither shall he go out of the holy places, lest he
defile the sanctuary of the Lord, because the oil of the holy
unction of his God is upon him. I am the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>He shall take a virgin unto his wife:</span></li>

<li><span>He shall not mingle the stock of his kindred with the
common people of his nation: for I am the Lord who sanctify

families, hath a blemish, he shall not offer bread to his
God.</span></li>
<li><span>Neither shall he approach to minister to him: If he be
blind, if he be lame, if he have a little, or a great, or a crooked
nose,</span></li>
<li><span>If his foot, or if his hand be broken,</span></li>
<li><span>If he be crookbacked, or blear eyed, or have a pearl in
his eye, or a continual scab, or a dry scurf in his body, or a
rupture:</span></li>
<li><span>Whosoever of the seed of Aaron the priest hath a blemish,

<li><span>Six days shall ye do work: the seventh day, because it is
the rest of the sabbath, shall be called holy. You shall do no work
on that day: it is the sabbath of the Lord in all your
habitations.</span></li>
<li><span>These also are the holy days of the Lord, which you must
celebrate in their seasons.</span></li>
<li><span>The first month, the fourteenth day of the month at
evening, is the phase of the Lord:</span></li>
<li><span>And the fifteenth day of the same month is the solemnity
of the unleavened bread of the Lord. Seven days shall you eat
unleavened bread.</span></li>

you shall do no servile work therein:</span></li>

days. And the seventh day shall be more solemn, and more holy: and
you shall do no servile work therein.</span></li>

firstfruits of your harvest to the priest:</span></li>
<li><span>Who shall lift up the shed before the Lord, the next day
after the sabbath, that it may be acceptable for you, and shall
sanctify it.</span></li>
<li><span>And on the same day that the sheaf is consecrated, a lamb
without blemish of the first year shall be killed for a holocaust
of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And the libations shall be offered with it, two tenths of
hour tempered with oil for a burnt offering of the Lord, and a most
sweet odour: libations also of wine, the fourth part of a
hin.</span></li>
<li><span>You shall not eat either bread, or parched corn, or
frumenty of the harvest, until the day that you shall offer thereof
to your God. It is a precept for ever throughout your generations,
and all your dwellings.</span></li>
<li><span>You shall count therefore from the morrow after the
sabbath, wherein you offered the sheaf of the firstfruits, seven
full weeks.</span></li>
<li><span>Even unto the marrow after the seventh week be expired,
that is to say, fifty days, and so you shall offer a new sacrifice
to the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Out of all your dwellings, two leaves of the firstfruits,
of two tenths of flour leavened, which you shall bake for the
firstfruits of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And you shall offer with the leaves seven lambs without
blemish of the first year, and one calf from the herd, and two
rams, and they shall be for a holocaust with their libations far a
most sweet odour to the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>You shall offer also a buck goat for sin, and two lambs
of the first year for sacrifices of peace offerings.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the priest hath lifted them up with the leaves
of the firstfruits before the Lord, they shall fall to his
use.</span></li>
<li><span>And you shall call this day most solemn, and most holy.
You shall do no servile work therein. It shall be an everlasting
ordinance in all your dwellings and generations.</span></li>
<li><span>And when you reap the corn of your land, you shall not
cut it to the very ground: neither shall you gather the ears that
remain; but you shall leave them for the poor and for the
strangers. I am the Lord your God.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>

because it is a day of propitiation, that the Lord your God may be
merciful unto you.</span></li>
<li><span>Every soul that is not afflicted on this day, shall
perish from among his people:</span></li>
<li><span>And every soul that shall do any work, the same will I
destroy from among his people.</span></li>

<li><span>It is a sabbath of rest, and you shell afflict your souls
beginning on the ninth day of the month: from evening until evening
you shall celebrate your sabbaths.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Say to the children of Israel: From the fifteenth day of
this same seventh month, shall be kept the feast of tabernacles
seven days to the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>The first day shall be called most solemn and most holy:
you shall do no servile work therein. And seven days you shall
offer holocausts to the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>The eighth day also shall be most solemn and most holy,
and you shall offer holocausts to the Lord: for it is the day of
assembly and congregation: you shall do no servile work
therein.</span></li>
<li><span>These are the feasts of the Lord, which you shall call
most solemn and most holy, and shall offer on them oblations to the
Lord, holocausts and libations according to the rite of every
day,</span></li>
<li><span>Besides the sabbaths of the Lord, and your gifts, and
those things that you offer by vow, or which you shall give to the
Lord voluntarily.</span></li>
<li><span>So from the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you
shall have gathered in all the fruits of your land, you shall
celebrate the feast of the Lord seven days: on the first day and
the eighth shall be a sabbath, that is a day of rest.</span></li>
<li><span>And you shall take to you on the first day the fruits of
the fairest tree, and branches of palm trees, and boughs of thick
trees, and willows of the brook, and you shall rejoice before the
Lord your God.</span></li>
<li><span>And you shall keep the solemnity thereof seven days in
the year. It shall be an everlasting ordinance in your generations.
In the seventh month shall you celebrate this feast.</span></li>
<li><span>And you shall dwell in bowers seven days: every one that
is of the race of Israel, shall dwell in tabernacles:</span></li>
<li><span>That your posterity may know, that I made the children of
Israel to dwell in tabernacles, when I brought them out of the land
of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses spoke concerning the feasts of the Lord to the
children of Israel.</span></li>

<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee
the finest and dearest oil of olives, to furnish the lamps
continually,</span></li>
<li><span>Without the veil of the testimony in the tabernacle of
the covenant. And Aaron shall set them from evening until morning
before the Lord, by a perpetual service and rite in your
generations.</span></li>
<li><span>They shall be set upon the most pure candlestick before
the Lord continually.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt take also fine hour, and shalt bake twelve
leaves thereof, two tenths shall be in every loaf :</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt set them six and six one against another
upon the most clean table before the Lord:</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt put upon them the dearest frankincense,
that the bread may be for a memorial of the oblation of the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Every sabbath they shall be changed before the Lord,
being received of the children of Israel by an everlasting
covenant:</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall be Aaron's and his sons', that they may
eat them in the holy place: because it is most holy of the
sacrifices of the Lord by a perpetual right.</span></li>
<li><span>And behold there went out the son of a woman of Israel,
whom she had of an Egyptian, among the children of Israel, and fell
at words in the camp with a man of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he had blasphemed the name, and had cursed it,
he was brought to Moses: (now his mother was called Salumith, the
daughter of Dabri, of the tribe of Dan:)</span></li>
<li><span>And they put him into prison, till they might know what
the Lord would command.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses,</span></li>
<li><span>Saying: Bring forth the blasphemer without the camp, and
let them that heard him, put their hands upon his head, and let all
the people stone him.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt speak to the children of Israel: the man
that curseth his God, shall bear his sin:</span></li>
<li><span>And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, dying let
him die: all the multitude shall stone him, whether he be a native
or a stranger. He that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, dying let
him die.</span></li>
<li><span>He that striketh and killeth a man, dying let him
die.</span></li>
<li><span>He that killeth a beast, shall make it good, that is to
say, shall give beast for beast.</span></li>
<li><span>He that giveth a blemish to any of his neighbours: as he
hath done, so shall it be done to him:</span></li>
<li><span>Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, shall he
restore. What blemish he gave, the like shall he be compelled to
suffer.</span></li>
<li><span>He that striketh a beast, shall render another. He that
striketh a man shall be punished.</span></li>
<li><span>Let there be equal judgment among you, whether he be a
stranger, or a native that offends: because I am the Lord your
God.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses spoke to the children of Israel: and they
brought forth him that had blasphemed, without the camp, and they
stoned him. And the children of Israel did as the Lord had
commanded Moses.</span></li>

<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="25">Leviticus 25</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses in mount Sinai,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to
them: When you shall have entered into the land which I will give
you, observe the rest of the sabbath to the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Six years thou shalt sow thy field and six years thou
shalt prune thy vineyard, and shalt gather the fruits
thereof:</span></li>
<li><span>But in the seventh year there shall be a sabbath to the
land, of the resting of the Lord: thou shalt not sow thy field, nor
prune thy vineyard.</span></li>
<li><span>What the ground shall bring forth of itself, thou shalt
not reap: neither shalt thou gather the grapes of the firstfruits
as a vintage: for it is a year of rest to the land:</span></li>
<li><span>But they shall be unto you for meat, to thee and to thy
manservant, to thy maidservant and thy hireling, and to the
strangers that sojourn with thee:</span></li>
<li><span>All things that grow shall be meat to thy beasts and to
thy cattle.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt also number to thee seven weeks of years, that
is to say, seven times seven, which together make forty-nine
years:</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt sound the trumpet in the seventh month,
the tenth day of the month, in the time of the expiation in all
your land.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt sanctify the fiftieth year, and shalt
proclaim remission to all the inhabitants of thy land: for it is
the year of jubilee. Every man shall return to his possession, and
every one shall go back to his former family:</span></li>
<li><span>Because it is the jubilee and the fiftieth year. You
shall not sow, nor reap the things that grow in the field of their
own accord, neither shall you gather the firstfruits of the
vines,</span></li>
<li><span>Because of the sanctification of the jubilee: but as they
grow you shall presently eat them.</span></li>
<li><span>In the year of the jubilee all shall return to their
possessions.</span></li>
<li><span>When thou shalt sell any thing to thy neighbour, or shalt
buy of him; grieve not thy brother: but thou shalt buy of him
according to the number of years from the jubilee.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall sell to thee according to the computation of
the fruits.</span></li>
<li><span>The more years remain after the jubilee, the more shall
the price increase: and the less time is counted, so much the less
shall the purchase cost. For he shall sell to thee the time of the
fruits.</span></li>
<li><span>Do not afflict your countrymen, but let every one fear
his God: because I am the Lord your God.</span></li>
<li><span>Do my precepts, and keep my judgments, and fulfil them:
that you may dwell in the land without any fear,</span></li>
<li><span>And the ground may yield you its fruits, of which you may
eat your fill, fearing no mall's invasion.</span></li>
<li><span>But if you say: What shall we eat the seventh year, if we
sow not, nor gather our fruits?</span></li>
<li><span>I will give you my blessing the sixth year, and it shall
yield the fruits of three years:</span></li>
<li><span>And the eighth year you shall sow, and shall eat of the
old fruits, until the ninth year: till new grow up, you shall eat
the old store.</span></li>
<li><span>The land also shall not be sold for ever: because it is
mine, and you are strangers and sojourners with me.</span></li>
<li><span>For which cause all the country of your possession shall
be under the condition of redemption.</span></li>
<li><span>If thy brother being impoverished sell his little
possession, and his kinsman will, he may redeem what he had
sold.</span></li>
<li><span>But if he have no kinsman, and he himself can find the
price to redeem it:</span></li>
<li><span>The value of the fruits shall be counted from that time
when he sold it: and the overplus he shall restore to the buyer,
and so shall receive his possession again.</span></li>
<li><span>But if his hands find not the means to repay the price,
the buyer shall have what he bought, until the year of the jubilee.
For in that year all that is sold shall return to the owner, and to
the ancient possessor.</span></li>
<li><span>He that selleth a house within the walls of a city, shall
have the liberty to redeem it, until one year be
expired:</span></li>
<li><span>If he redeem it not, and the whole year be fully out, the
buyer shall possess it, and his posterity for ever, and it can- not
be redeemed, not even in the jubilee.</span></li>
<li><span>But if the house be in a village, that hath no walls, it
shall be sold according to the same law as the fields: if it be not
redeemed before, in the jubilee it shall return to the
owner.</span></li>
<li><span>The houses of Levites, which are in cities, may always be
redeemed:</span></li>
<li><span>If they be not redeemed, in the jubilee they shall all
return to the owners, because the houses of the cities of the
Levites are for their possessions among the children of
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>But let not their suburbs be sold, because it is a
perpetual possession.</span></li>
<li><span>If thy brother be impoverished, and weak of hand, and
thou receive him as a stranger and sojourner, and he live with
thee,</span></li>
<li><span>Take not usury of him nor more than thou gavest: fear thy
God, that thy brother may live with thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor exact
of him any increase of fruits.</span></li>
<li><span>I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land
of Egypt, that I might give you the land of Chanaan, and might be
your God.</span></li>
<li><span>If thy brother constrained by poverty, sell himself to
thee, thou shalt not oppress him with the service of
bondservants:</span></li>
<li><span>But he shall be as a hireling, and a sojourner: he shall
work with thee until the year of the jubilee,</span></li>
<li><span>And afterwards he shall go out with his children, and
shall return to his kindred and to the possession of his
fathers,</span></li>
<li><span>For they are my servants, and I brought them out of the
land of Egypt: let them not be sold as bondmen:</span></li>
<li><span>Afflict him not by might, but fear thy God.</span></li>
<li><span>Let your bondmen, and your bondwomen, be of the nations
that are round about you.</span></li>
<li><span>And of the strangers that sojourn among you, or that were
born of them in your land, these you shall have for
servants:</span></li>
<li><span>And by right of inheritance shall leave them to your
posterity, and shall possess them for ever. But oppress not your
brethren the children of Israel by might.</span></li>
<li><span>If the hand of a stranger or a sojourner grow strong
among you, and thy brother being impoverished sell himself to him,
or to any of his race:</span></li>
<li><span>After the sale he may be redeemed. He that will of his
brethren shall redeem him:</span></li>
<li><span>Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, or his kinsman, by
blood, or by affinity. But if he himself be able also, he shall
redeem himself,</span></li>
<li><span>Counting only the years from the time of his selling unto
the year of the jubilee: and counting the money that he was sold
for, according to the number of the years and the reckoning of a
hired servant,</span></li>
<li><span>If there be many years that remain until the jubilee,
according to them shall he also repay the price.</span></li>
<li><span>If few, he shall make the reckoning with him according to
the number of the years, and shall repay to the buyer of what
remaineth of the years,</span></li>
<li><span>His wages being allowed for which he served before: he
shall not afflict him violently in thy sight.</span></li>
<li><span>And if by these means he cannot be redeemed, in the year
of the jubilee he shall go out with his children.</span></li>
<li><span>For the children of Israel are my servants, whom I
brought forth out of the land of Egypt.</span></li>

<li><span>I am the Lord your God: you shall not make to yourselves
any idol or graven thing, neither shall you erect pillars, nor set
up a remarkable stone in your land, to adore it: for I am the Lord
your God.</span></li>
<li><span>Keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>If you walk in my precepts, and keep my commandments, and
do them, I will give you rein in due seasons.</span></li>
<li><span>And the ground shall bring forth its increase, and the
trees shall be filled with fruit.</span></li>
<li><span>The threshing of your harvest shall reach unto the
vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and you
shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land without
fear.</span></li>
<li><span>I will give peace in your coasts: you shall sleep, and
there shall be none to make you afraid. I will take away evil
beasts: and the sword shall not pass through your
quarters.</span></li>
<li><span>You shall pursue your enemies, and they shall fall before
you.</span></li>
<li><span>Five of yours shall pursue a hundred others, and a
hundred of you ten thousand: your enemies shall fall before you by
the sword.</span></li>
<li><span>I will look on you, and make you increase: you shell be
multiplied, and I will establish my covenant with you.</span></li>
<li><span>You shall eat the oldest of the old store, and, new
coming on, you shall cast away the old.</span></li>
<li><span>I will set my tabernacle in the midst of you, and my soul
shall not cast you off.</span></li>
<li><span>I will walk among you, and will be your God, and you
shall be my people.</span></li>
<li><span>I am the Lord your God: who have brought you out of the
land of the Egyptians, that you should not serve them, and who have
broken the chains of your necks, that you might go
upright.</span></li>
<li><span>But if you will not hear me, nor do all my
commandments,</span></li>
<li><span>If you despise my laws, and contemn my judgments so as
not to do those things which are appointed by me, and to make void
my covenant:</span></li>
<li><span>I also will do these things to you: I will quickly visit
you with poverty, and burning heat, which shall waste your eyes,
and consume your lives. You shall sow your seed in vain, which
shall be devoured by your enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>I will set my face against you, and you shall fall down
before your enemies, and shall be made subject to them that hate
you, you shall flee when no man pursueth you.</span></li>
<li><span>But if you will not yet for all this obey me: I will
chastise you seven times more for your sins,</span></li>
<li><span>And I will break the pride of your stubbornness, and I
will make to you the heaven above as iron, and the earth as
brass:</span></li>
<li><span>Your labour shall be spent in vain, the ground shall not
bring forth her increase, nor the trees yield their
fruit.</span></li>
<li><span>If you walk contrary to me, and will not hearken to me, I
will bring seven times more plagues upon you for your
sins:</span></li>
<li><span>And I will send in upon you the beasts of the held, to
destroy you and your cattle, and make you few in number, and that
your highways may be desolate.</span></li>
<li><span>And if even so you will not amend, but will walk contrary
to me:</span></li>
<li><span>I also will walk contrary to you, and will strike you
seven times for your sins.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will bring in upon you the sword that shall avenge
my covenant. And when you shall flee into the cities, I will send
the pestilence in the midst of you, and you shall be delivered into
the hands of your enemies,</span></li>
<li><span>After I shall have broken the staff of your bread: so
that ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and give it out
by weight: and you shall eat, and shall not be filled.</span></li>
<li><span>But if you will not for all this hearken to me, but will
walk against me:</span></li>
<li><span>I will also go against you with opposite fury, and I will
chastise you with seven plagues for your sins,</span></li>
<li><span>So that you shall eat the flesh of your sons and of your
daughters.</span></li>
<li><span>I will destroy your high places, and break your idols.
You shall fall among the ruins of your idols, and my soul shall
abhor you.</span></li>
<li><span>Insomuch that I will bring your cities to be a
wilderness, and I will make your sanctuaries desolate, and will
receive no more your sweet odours.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will destroy your land, and your enemies shall be
astonished at it, when they shall be the inhabitants
thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will scatter you among the Gentiles, and I will
draw out the sword after you, and your land shall be desert, and
your cities destroyed.</span></li>
<li><span>Then shell the land enjoy her sabbaths all the days of
her desolation: when you shall be</span></li>
<li><span>In the enemy's land, she shall keep a sabbath, and rest
in the sabbaths of her desolation, because she did not rest in your
sabbaths when you dwelt therein.</span></li>
<li><span>And as to them that shall remain of you I will send fear
in their hearts in the countries of their enemies, the sound of a
flying leaf shall terrify them, and they shall flee as it were from
the sword: they shall fall, when no man pursueth them,</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall every one fall upon their brethren as
fleeing from wars, none of you shall dare to resist your
enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>You shall perish among the Gentiles, and an enemy's land
shall consume you.</span></li>
<li><span>And if of them also some remain, they shall pine away in
their iniquities, in the land of their enemies, and they shall be
afflicted for the sins of their fathers, and their own:</span></li>
<li><span>Until they confess their iniquities and the iniquities of
their ancestors, whereby they have transgressed me, and walked
contrary unto me.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore I also will walk them, and bring them into
their enemies' land until their uncircumcised mind be ashamed: then
shall they pray for their sins.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will remember my covenant, that I made with Jacob,
and Isaac, and Abraham. I will remember also the land:</span></li>
<li><span>Which when she shall be left by them, shall enjoy her
sabbaths, being desolate for them. But they shall pray for their
sins, because they rejected my judgments, and despised my
laws.</span></li>
<li><span>And yet for all that when they were in the land of their
enemies, I did not cast them off altogether, neither did I so
despise them that they should be quite consumed, and I should make
void my covenant with them. For I am the Lord their
God.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will remember my former covenant, when I brought
them out of the land of Egypt, in the sight of the Gentiles, to be
their God. I am the Lord. These are the judgments, and precepts,
and laws, which the Lord gave between him and the children of
Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to
them: The man that shall have made a vow, and promised his soul to
God, shall give the price according to estimation.</span></li>
<li><span>If it be a man from twenty years old unto sixty years
old, he shall give fifty sides of silver, after the weight of the
sanctuary:</span></li>
<li><span>If a woman, thirty.</span></li>
<li><span>But from the fifth year until the twentieth, a man shall
give twenty sicles: a woman ten.</span></li>
<li><span>From one month until the fifth year. for a male shall be
given five sides: for a female three.</span></li>
<li><span>A man that is sixty years old or upward, shall give
fifteen aisles: a woman ten.</span></li>
<li><span>If he be poor, and not able to pay tile estimation, he
shall stand before tile priest: and as much as he shall value him
at, and see him able to pay, so much shall he give.</span></li>
<li><span>But a beast that may be sacrificed to the Lord, if ally
one shall vow, shall be holy,</span></li>
<li><span>And cannot be changed, that is to say, neither a better
for a worse, nor a worse for a better. And if he shall change it:
both that which was changed, and that for which it was changed,
shall be consecrated to the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>An unclean beast, which cannot be sacrificed to the Lord,
if my man shall vow, shall be brought before the
priest:</span></li>
<li><span>Who judging whether it be good or bad, shall set the
price:</span></li>
<li><span>Which if he that offereth it will give, he shall add
above the estimation the fifth part.</span></li>
<li><span>If a man shall vow his house, and sanctify it to the
Lord, the priest shall consider it, whether it be good or bad, and
it shall be sold according to the price, which he shall
appoint.</span></li>
<li><span>But if he that vowed, will redeem it, he shall give the
fifth part of the estimation over and above, and shall have the
house.</span></li>
<li><span>And if he vow the field of his possession, and consecrate
it to the Lord, the price shall be rated according to the measure
of the seed. If the ground be sowed with thirty bushels of barley,
let it be sold for fifty sides of silver.</span></li>
<li><span>If he vow his field immediately from the year of jubilee
that is beginning, as much as it may be worth, at so much it shall
be rated.</span></li>
<li><span>But if some time after, the priest shall reckon the money
according to the number of years that remain until the jubilee, and
the price shall be abated.</span></li>
<li><span>And if he that had vowed, will redeem his field, he shall
add the fifth part of the money of the estimation, and shall
possess it.</span></li>
<li><span>And if he will not redeem it, but it be sold to any other
man, he that vowed it, may not redeem it any more:</span></li>
<li><span>For when the day of jubilee cometh, it shall be
sanctified to the Lord, and as a possession consecrated, pertaineth
to the right of the priests.</span></li>
<li><span>If a field that was bought, and not of a man's ancestors'
possession, be sanctified to the Lord,</span></li>
<li><span>The priest shall reckon the price according to the number
of years: unto the jubilee: and he that had vowed, shall give that
to the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>But in the jubilee, it shall return to the former owner,
who had sold it, and had it in the lot of his
possession.</span></li>
<li><span>All estimation shall be made according to the side of the
sanctuary. A sicle hath twenty obols.</span></li>
<li><span>The firstborn, which belong to the Lord, no man may
sanctify and vow: whether it be bullock, or sheep, they are the
Lord's.</span></li>
<li><span>And if it be an unclean beast, he that offereth it shall
redeem it, according to thy estimation, and shall add the fifth
part of the price. If he will not redeem it, it shall be sold to
another for how much soever it was estimated by thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Any thing that is devoted to the Lord, whether it be man,
or beast, or field, shall not be sold, neither may it be redeemed.
Whatsoever is once consecrated shall be holy of holies to the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And any consecration that is offered by man, shall not be
redeemed, but dying shall die.</span></li>
<li><span>All tithes of the land, whether of corn, or of the fruits
of trees, are the Lord's, and are sanctified to him.</span></li>
<li><span>And if any man will redeem his tithes, he shall add the
fifth part of them.</span></li>
<li><span>Of all the tithes of oxen, and sheep, and goats, that
pass under the shepherd's rod, every tenth that cometh shall be
sanctified to the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>It shall not be chosen neither good nor bad, neither
shall it be changed for another. If any man change it: both that
which was changed, and that for which it was changed, shall be
sanctified to the Lord, and shall not be redeemed.</span></li>
<li><span>These are the precepts which the Lord commanded Moses for
the children of Israel in mount Sinai.</span></li>
