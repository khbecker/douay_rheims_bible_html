  <h2><a name="1">Habacuc 1</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>The burden that Habacuc the prophet saw.</span></li>

    <li><span>How long, O Lord, shall I cry, and thou wilt not
    hear? shall I cry out to thee suffering violence, and thou wilt
    not save?</span></li>

    <li><span>Why hast thou shewn me iniquity and grievance, to see
    rapine and injustice before me? and there is a judgment, but
    opposition is more powerful.</span></li>

    <li><span>Therefore the law is torn in pieces, and judgment
    cometh not to the end: because the wicked prevaileth against
    the just, therefore wrong judgment goeth forth.</span></li>

    <li><span>Behold ye among the nations, and see: wonder, and be
    astonished: for a work is done in your days, which no man will
    believe when it shall be told.</span></li>

    <li><span>For behold, I will raise up the Chaldeans, a bitter
    and swift nation, marching upon the breadth of the earth, to
    possess the dwelling places that are not their own.</span></li>

    <li><span>They are dreadful, and terrible: from themselves
    shall their judgment, and their burden proceed.</span></li>

    <li><span>Their horses are lighter than leopards, and swifter
    than evening wolves; and their horsemen shall be spread abroad:
    for their horsemen shall come from afar, they shall fly as an
    eagle that maketh haste to eat.</span></li>

    <li><span>They shall all come to the prey, their face is like a
    burning wind: and they shall gather together captives as the
    sand.</span></li>

    <li><span>And their prince shall triumph over kings, and
    princes shall be his laughingstock: and he shall laugh at every
    strong hold, and shall cast up a mount, and shall take
    it.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then shall his spirit be changed, and he shall pass,
    and fall: this is his strength of his god.</span></li>

    <li><span>Wast thou not from the beginning, O Lord my God, my
    holy one, and we shall not die? Lord, thou hast appointed him
    for judgment: and made him strong for correction.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thy eyes are too pure to behold evil, and thou canst
    not look on iniquity. Why lookest thou upon them that do unjust
    things, and holdest thy peace when the wicked devoureth the man
    that is more just than himself?</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou wilt make men as the fishes of the sea, and
    as the creeping things that have no ruler.</span></li>

    <li><span>He lifted up all them with his hook, he drew them in
    his drag, and gathered them into his net: for this he will be
    glad and rejoice.</span></li>

    <li><span>Therefore will he offer victims to his drag, and he
    will sacrifice to his net: because through them his portion is
    made fat, and his meat dainty.</span></li>

    <li><span>For this cause therefore he spreadeth his net, and
    will not spare continually to slay the nations.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="2">Habacuc 2</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>I will stand upon my watch, and fix my foot upon the
    tower: and I will watch, to see what will be said to me, and
    what I may answer to him that reproveth me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord answered me, and said: Write the vision,
    and make it plain upon tables: that he that readeth it may run
    over it.</span></li>

    <li><span>For as yet the vision is far off, and it shall appear
    at the end, and shall not lie: if it make any delay, wait for
    it: for it shall surely come, and it shall not be
    slack.</span></li>

    <li><span>Behold, he that is unbelieving, his soul shall not be
    right in himself: but the just shall live in his
    faith.</span></li>

    <li><span>And as wine deceiveth him that drinketh it: so shall
    the proud man be, and he shall not be honoured: who hath
    enlarged his desire like hell: and is himself like death, and
    he is never satisfied: but will gather together unto him all
    nations, and heap together unto him all people.</span></li>

    <li><span>Shall not all these take up a parable against him,
    and a dark speech concerning him: and it shall be said: Woe to
    him that heapeth together that which is not his own? how long
    also doth he load himself with thick clay?</span></li>

    <li><span>Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee:
    and they be stirred up that shall tear thee, and thou shalt be
    a spoil to them?</span></li>

    <li><span>Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all that
    shall be left of the people shall spoil thee: because of men's
    blood, and for the iniquity of the land, of the city, and of
    all that dwell therein.</span></li>

    <li><span>Woe to him that gathereth together an evil
    covetousness to his house, that his nest may be on high, and
    thinketh he may be delivered out of the hand of
    evil.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou hast devised confusion to thy house, thou hast
    cut off many people, and thy soul hath sinned.</span></li>

    <li><span>For the stone shall cry out of the wall: and the
    timber that is between the joints of the building, shall
    answer.</span></li>

    <li><span>Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and
    prepareth a city by iniquity.</span></li>

    <li><span>Are not these things from the Lord of hosts? for the
    people shall labour in a great fire: and the nations in vain,
    and they shall faint.</span></li>

    <li><span>For the earth shall be filled, that men may know the
    glory of the Lord, as waters covering the sea.</span></li>

    <li><span>Woe to him that giveth drink to his friend, and
    presenteth his gall, and maketh him drunk, that he may behold
    his nakedness.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou art filled with shame instead of glory: drink
    thou also, and fall fast asleep: the cup of the right hand of
    the Lord shall compass thee, and shameful vomiting shall be on
    thy glory.</span></li>

    <li><span>For the iniquity of Libanus shall cover thee, and the
    ravaging of beasts shall terrify them because of the blood of
    men, and the iniquity of the land, and of the city, and of all
    that dwell therein.</span></li>

    <li><span>What doth the graven thing avail, because the maker
    thereof hath graven it, a molten, and a false image? because
    the forger thereof hath trusted in a thing of his own forging,
    to make dumb idols.</span></li>

    <li><span>Woe to him that saith to wood: Awake: to the dumb
    stone: Arise: can it teach? Behold, it is laid over with gold,
    and silver, and there is no spirit in the bowels
    thereof.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth
    keep silence before him.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="3">Habacuc 3</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>A PRAYER OF HABACUC THE PROPHET FOR
    IGNORANCES.</span></li>

    <li><span>O Lord, I have heard thy hearing, and was afraid. O
    Lord, thy work, in the midst of the years bring it to life: In
    the midst of the years thou shalt make it known: when thou art
    angry, thou wilt remember mercy.</span></li>

    <li><span>God will come from the south, and the holy one from
    mount Pharan: His glory covered the heavens, and the earth is
    full of his praise.</span></li>

    <li><span>His brightness shall be as the light; horns are in
    his hands: There is his strength hid:</span></li>

    <li><span>Death shall go before his face. And the devil shall
    go forth before his feet.</span></li>

    <li><span>He stood and measured the earth. He beheld, and
    melted the nations: and the ancient mountains were crushed to
    pieces. The hills of the world were bowed down by the journeys
    of his eternity.</span></li>

    <li><span>I saw the tents of Ethiopia for their iniquity, the
    curtains of the land of Madian shall be troubled.</span></li>

    <li><span>Wast thou angry, O Lord, with the rivers? or was thy
    wrath upon the rivers? or thy indignation in the sea? Who will
    ride upon thy horses: and thy chariots are
    salvation.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou wilt surely take up thy bow: according to the
    oaths which thou hast spoken to the tribes. Thou wilt divide
    the rivers of the earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>The mountains saw thee, and were grieved: the great
    body of waters passed away. The deep put forth its voice: the
    deep lifted up its hands.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sun and the moon stood still in their habitation,
    in the light of thy arrows, they shall go in the brightness of
    thy glittering spear.</span></li>

    <li><span>In thy anger thou wilt tread the earth under foot: in
    thy wrath thou wilt astonish the nations.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people:
    for salvation with thy Christ. Thou struckest the head of the
    house of the wicked: thou hast laid bare his foundation even to
    the neck.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou hast cursed his sceptres, the head of his
    warriors, them that came out as a whirlwind to scatter me.
    Their joy was like that of him that devoureth the poor man in
    secret.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou madest a way in the sea for thy horses, in the
    mud of many waters.</span></li>

    <li><span>I have heard and my bowels were troubled: my lips
    trembled at the voice. Let rottenness enter into my bones, and
    swarm under me. That I may rest in the day of tribulation: that
    I may go up to our people that are girded.</span></li>

    <li><span>For the fig tree shall not blossom: and there shall
    be no spring in the vines. The labour of the olive tree shall
    fail: and the fields shall yield no food: the flock shall be
    cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the
    stalls.</span></li>

    <li><span>But I will rejoice in the Lord: and I will joy in God
    my Jesus.</span></li>

    <li><span>The Lord God is my strength: and he will make my feet
    like the feet of harts: and he the conqueror will lead me upon
    my high places singing psalms.</span></li>
