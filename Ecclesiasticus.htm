<div class="c2">THE PROLOGUE</div>
<ol>
<li><span>The knowledge of many and great things hath been shewn us
by the law, and the prophets, and others that have followed them:
for which things Israel is to be commended for doctrine and wisdom,
because not only they that speak must needs be skilful, but
strangers also, both speaking and writing, may by their means
become most learned.</span></li>
<li><span>My grandfather Jesus, after he had much given himself to
a diligent reading of the law, and the prophets, and other books,
that were delivered to us from our fathers, had a mind also to
write something himself, pertaining to doctrine and wisdom: that
such as are desirous to learn, and are made knowing in these
things, may be more and more attentive in mind, and be strengthened
to live according to the law.</span></li>
<li><span>I entreat you therefore to come with benevolence, and to
read with attention, and to pardon us for those things wherein we
may seem, while we follow the image of wisdom, to come short in the
composition of words; for the Hebrew words have not the same force
in them when translated into another tongue. And not only these,
but the law also itself, and the prophets, and the rest of the
books, have no small difference, when they are spoken in their own
language.</span></li>
<li><span>For in the eight and thirtieth year coming into Egypt,
when Ptolemy Evergetes was king, and continuing there a long time,
I found there books left, of no small nor contemptible
learning.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore I thought it good, and necessary for me to
bestow some diligence and labour to interpret this book; and with
much watching and study in some space of time, I brought the book
to an end, and set it forth for the service of them that are
willing to apply their mind, and to learn how they ought to conduct
themselves, who purpose to lead their life according to the law of
the Lord.</span></li>

<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="1">Ecclesiasticus 1</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>All wisdom is from the Lord God, and hath been always
with him, and is before all time.</span></li>
<li><span>Who hath numbered the sand of the sea, and the drops of
rain, and the days of the world? Who hath measured the height of
heaven, and the breadth of the earth, and the depth of the
abyss?</span></li>
<li><span>Who hath searched out the wisdom of God that goeth before
all things?</span></li>
<li><span>Wisdom hath been created before all things, and the
understanding of prudence from everlasting.</span></li>
<li><span>The word of God on high is the fountain of wisdom, and
her ways are everlasting commandments.</span></li>
<li><span>To whom hath the root of wisdom been revealed, and who
hath known her wise counsels?</span></li>
<li><span>To whom hath the discipline of wisdom been revealed and
made manifest? and who hath understood the multiplicity of her
steps?</span></li>
<li><span>There is one most high Creator Almighty, and a powerful
king, and greatly to be feared, who sitteth upon his throne, and is
the God of dominion.</span></li>
<li><span>He created her in the Holy Ghost, and saw her, and
numbered her, and measured her.</span></li>
<li><span>And he poured her out upon all his works, and upon all
flesh according to his gift, and hath given her to them that love
him.</span></li>
<li><span>The fear of the Lord is honour, and glory, and gladness,
and a crown of joy.</span></li>
<li><span>The fear of the Lord shall delight the heart, and shall
give joy, and gladness, and length of days.</span></li>
<li><span>With him that feareth the Lord, it shall go well in the
latter end, and in the day of his death he shall be
blessed.</span></li>
<li><span>The love of God is honourable wisdom.</span></li>
<li><span>Ana they to whom she shall shew herself love her by the
sight, and by the knowledge of her great works.</span></li>
<li><span>The fear of the Lord Is the beginning of wisdom, and was
created with the faithful in the womb, it walketh with chosen
women, and is known with the just and faithful.</span></li>
<li><span>The fear of the Lord is the religiousness of
knowledge.</span></li>
<li><span>Religiousness shall keep and justify the heart, it shall
give joy and gladness.</span></li>
<li><span>It shall go well with him that feareth the Lord, and in
the days of his end he shall be blessed.</span></li>
<li><span>To fear God is the fulness of wisdom, and fulness is from
the fruits thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>She shall fill all her house with her increase, and the
storehouses with her treasures.</span></li>
<li><span>The fear of the Lord is a crown of wisdom, filling up
peace and the fruit of salvation:</span></li>
<li><span>And it hath seen, and numbered her: but both are the
gifts of God.</span></li>
<li><span>Wisdom shall distribute knowledge, and understanding of
prudence: and exalteth the glory of them that hold her.</span></li>
<li><span>The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord: and the branches
thereof are longlived.</span></li>
<li><span>In the treasures of wisdom is understanding, and
religiousness of knowledge: but to sinners wisdom is an
abomination.</span></li>
<li><span>The fear of the Lord driveth out sin:</span></li>
<li><span>For he that is without fear, cannot be justified: for the
wrath of his high spirits is his ruin.</span></li>
<li><span>A patient man shall bear for a time, and afterwards joy
shall be restored to him.</span></li>
<li><span>A good understanding will hide his words for a time, and
the lips of many shall declare his wisdom.</span></li>
<li><span>In the treasures of wisdom is the signification of
discipline:</span></li>
<li><span>But the worship of God is an abomination to a
sinner.</span></li>
<li><span>Son, if thou desire wisdom, keep justice, and God will
give her to thee.</span></li>
<li><span>For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and discipline: and
that which is agreeable to him,</span></li>
<li><span>Is faith, and meekness: and he will fill up his
treasures.</span></li>
<li><span>Be not incredulous to the fear of the Lord: and come not
to him with a double heart.</span></li>
<li><span>Be not a hypocrite in the sight of men, and let not thy
lips be a stumblingblock to thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Watch over them, lest thou fall, and bring dishonour upon
thy soul,</span></li>
<li><span>And God discover thy secrets, and cast thee down in the
midst of the congregation.</span></li>
<li><span>Because thou camest to the Lord wickedly, and thy heart
is full of guile and deceit.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>Son, when thou comest to the service of God, stand in
justice and in fear, and prepare thy soul for
temptation.</span></li>
<li><span>Humble thy heart, and endure: incline thy ear, and
receive the words of understanding: and make not haste in the time
of clouds.</span></li>
<li><span>Wait on God with patience: join thyself to God, and
endure, that thy life may be increased in the latter
end.</span></li>
<li><span>Take all that shall be brought upon thee: and in thy
sorrow endure, and in thy humiliation keep patience.</span></li>
<li><span>For gold and silver are tried in the fire, but acceptable
men in the furnace of humiliation.</span></li>
<li><span>Believe God, and he will recover thee: and direct thy
way, and trust in him. Keep his fear, and grow old
therein.</span></li>
<li><span>Ye that fear the Lord, wait for his mercy: and go not
aside from him, lest ye fall.</span></li>
<li><span>Ye that fear the Lord, believe him: and your reward shall
not be made void.</span></li>
<li><span>Ye that fear the Lord, hope in him: and mercy shall come
to you for your delight.</span></li>
<li><span>Ye that fear the Lord, love him, and your hearts shall be
enlightened.</span></li>
<li><span>My children behold the generations of men: and know ye
that no one hath hoped in the Lord, and hath been
confounded.</span></li>
<li><span>For who hath continued in his commandment, and hath been
forsaken? or who hath called upon him, and he despised
him?</span></li>
<li><span>For God is compassionate and merciful, and will forgive
sins in the day of tribulation: and he is a protector to all that
seek him in truth.</span></li>
<li><span>Woe to them that are of a double heart and to wicked
lips, and to the hands that do evil, and to the sinner that goeth
on the earth two ways.</span></li>
<li><span>Woe to them that are fainthearted, who believe not God:
and therefore they shall not be protected by him.</span></li>
<li><span>Woe to them that have lost patience, and that have
forsaken the right ways, and have gone aside into crooked
ways.</span></li>
<li><span>And what will they do, when the Lord shall begin to
examine?</span></li>
<li><span>They that fear the Lord, will not be incredulous to his
word: and they that love him, will keep his way.</span></li>
<li><span>They that fear the Lord, will seek after the things that
are well pleasing to him: and they that love him, shall be filled
with his law.</span></li>
<li><span>They that fear the Lord, will prepare their hearts, and
in his sight will sanctify their souls.</span></li>
<li><span>They that fear the Lord, keep his Commandments, and will
have patience even until his visitation,</span></li>
<li><span>Saying: If we do not penance, we shall fall into the
hands of the Lord, and not into the hands of men.</span></li>
<li><span>For according to his greatness, so also is his mercy with
him.</span></li>

<li><span>The sons of wisdom are the church of the just: and their
generation, obedience and love.</span></li>
<li><span>Children, hear the judgment of your father, and so do
that you may be saved.</span></li>
<li><span>For God hath made the father honourable to the children:
and seeking the judgment of the mothers, hath confirmed it upon the
children.</span></li>
<li><span>He that loveth God, shall obtain pardon for his sine by
prayer, and shall refrain himself from them, and shall be heard in
the prayer of days.</span></li>
<li><span>And he that honoureth his mother is as one that layeth up
a treasure.</span></li>
<li><span>He that honoureth his father shall have joy in his own
children, and in the day of his prayer he shall be
heard.</span></li>
<li><span>He that honoureth his father shall enjoy a long life: and
he that obeyeth the father, shall be a comfort to his
mother.</span></li>
<li><span>He that feareth the Lord, honoureth his parents, and will
serve them as his masters that brought him into the
world.</span></li>
<li><span>Honour thy father, in work and word, and all
patience,</span></li>
<li><span>That a blessing may come upon thee from him, and his
blessing may remain in the latter end.</span></li>
<li><span>The father's blessing establisheth the houses of the
children: but the mother's curse rooteth up the
foundation.</span></li>
<li><span>Glory not in the dishonour of thy father: for his shame
is no glory to thee.</span></li>
<li><span>For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father,
and a father without honour is the disgrace of the son.</span></li>
<li><span>Son, support the old age of thy father, and grieve him
not in his life;</span></li>
<li><span>And if his understanding fail, have patience with him,
and despise him not when thou art in thy strength: for the
relieving of the father shall not be for- gotten.</span></li>
<li><span>For good shall be repaid to thee for the sin of thy
mother.</span></li>
<li><span>And in justice thou shalt be built up, and in the day of
affliction thou shalt be remembered: and thy sine shall melt away
as the ice in the fair warm weather.</span></li>
<li><span>Of what an evil fame is he that forsaketh his father: and
he is cursed of God that angereth his mother.</span></li>
<li><span>My son, do thy works in meekness, and thou shalt be
beloved above the glory of men.</span></li>
<li><span>The greater thou art, the more humble thyself in all
things, and thou shalt find grace before God:</span></li>
<li><span>For great is the power of God alone, and he is honoured
by the humble.</span></li>
<li><span>Seek not the things that are too high for thee, and
search not into things above thy ability: but the things that God
hath commanded thee, think on them always, and in many of his works
be not curious.</span></li>
<li><span>For it is not necessary for thee to see with thy eyes
those things that are hid.</span></li>
<li><span>In unnecessary matters be not over curious, and in many
of his works thou shalt not be inquisitive.</span></li>
<li><span>For many things are shewn to thee above the understanding
of men.</span></li>
<li><span>And the suspicion of them hath deceived many, and hath
detained their minds in vanity.</span></li>
<li><span>A hard heart shall fear evil at the last: and he that
loveth danger shall perish in it.</span></li>
<li><span>A heart that goeth two ways shall not have success, and
the perverse of heart shall be scandalized therein.</span></li>
<li><span>A wicked heart shall be laden with sorrows, and the
sinner will add sin to sin.</span></li>
<li><span>The congregation of the proud shall not be healed: for
the plant of wickedness shall take root in them, and it shall not
be perceived.</span></li>
<li><span>The heart of the wise is understood in wisdom, and a good
ear will hear wisdom with all desire.</span></li>
<li><span>A wise heart, and which hath under- standing, will
abstain from sine, and in the works of justice shall have
success.</span></li>
<li><span>Water quencheth a flaming fire, and alms resisteth
sins:</span></li>
<li><span>And God provideth for him that sheweth favour: he
remembereth him afterwards, and in the time of his fall he shall
find a sure stay.</span></li>

<li><span>Son, defraud not the poor of alms, and turn not away thy
eyes from the poor.</span></li>
<li><span>Despise not the hungry soul: and provoke not the Boor in
his want.</span></li>
<li><span>Afflict not the heart of the needy, and defer not to give
to him that is in distress.</span></li>
<li><span>Reject not the petition of the afflicted: and turn not
away thy face from the needy.</span></li>
<li><span>Turn not away thy eyes from the poor for fear of anger:
and leave not to them that ask of thee to curse thee behind thy
back.</span></li>
<li><span>For the prayer of him that curseth thee in the bitterness
of his soul, shall be heard, for he that made him will hear
him.</span></li>
<li><span>Make thyself affable to the congregation of the poor, and
humble thy soul to the ancient, and bow thy head to a great
man.</span></li>
<li><span>Bow down thy ear cheerfully to the poor, and pay what
thou owest, and answer him peaceable words with
mildness.</span></li>
<li><span>Deliver him that suffereth wrong out of the hand of the
proud: and be not fainthearted in thy soul.</span></li>
<li><span>In judging be merciful to the fatherless as a father, and
as a husband to their mother.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt be as the obedient son of the most High,
and he will have mercy on thee more than a mother.</span></li>
<li><span>Wisdom inspireth life into her children, and protecteth
them that seek after her, and will go before them in the way of
justice.</span></li>
<li><span>And he that loveth her, loveth life: and they that watch
for her, shall embrace her sweetness.</span></li>
<li><span>They that hold her fast, shall inherit life: and
whithersoever she entereth, God will give a blessing.</span></li>
<li><span>They that serve her, shall be servants to the holy one:
and God loveth them that love her.</span></li>
<li><span>He that hearkeneth to her, shall judge nations: and he
that looketh upon her, shall remain secure.</span></li>
<li><span>If he trust to her, he shall inherit her, and his
generation shall be in assurance.</span></li>
<li><span>For she walketh with him in temptation, and at the first
she chooseth him.</span></li>
<li><span>She will bring upon him fear and dread and trial: and she
will scourge him with the affliction of her discipline, till she
try him by her laws, and trust his soul.</span></li>
<li><span>Then she will strengthen him, and make a straight way to
him, and give him joy,</span></li>
<li><span>And will disclose her secrets to him, and will heap upon
him treasures of knowledge and understanding of
justice.</span></li>
<li><span>But if he go astray, she will forsake him, and deliver
him into the hands of his enemy.</span></li>
<li><span>Son, observe the time, and fly from evil.</span></li>
<li><span>For thy soul be not ashamed to say the truth.</span></li>
<li><span>For there is a shame that bringeth sin, and there is a
shame that bringeth glory and grace.</span></li>
<li><span>Accept no person against thy own person, nor against thy
soul a lie.</span></li>
<li><span>Reverence not thy neighbour in his fall:</span></li>
<li><span>And refrain not to speak in the time of salvation. Hide
not thy wisdom in her beauty.</span></li>
<li><span>For by the tongue wisdom is discerned: and understanding,
and knowledge, and learning by the word of the wise, and
steadfastness in the works of justice.</span></li>
<li><span>In nowise speak against the truth, but be ashamed of the
lie of thy ignorance.</span></li>
<li><span>Be not ashamed to confess thy sins, but submit not
thyself to every man for sin.</span></li>
<li><span>Resist not against the face of the mighty, and do not
strive against the stream of the river.</span></li>
<li><span>Strive for justice for thy soul, and even unto death
fight for justice, and God will overthrow thy enemies for
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Be not hasty in thy tongue: and slack and remiss in thy
works.</span></li>
<li><span>Be not as a lion in thy house, terrifying them of thy
household, and oppressing them that are under thee.</span></li>

when thou shouldst give.</span></li>

heart:</span></li>
<li><span>And say not: How mighty am I? and who shall bring me

hatred, and enmity, and reproach.</span></li>

good.</span></li>
<li><span>Separate thyself from thy enemies, and take heed of thy
friends.</span></li>
<li><span>A faithful friend is a strong defence: and he that hath
found him, hath found a treasure.</span></li>
<li><span>Nothing can be compared to a faithful friend, and no
weight of gold and silver is able to countervail the goodness of
his fidelity.</span></li>
<li><span>A faithful friend is the medicine of life and
immortality: and they that fear the Lord, shall find
him.</span></li>
<li><span>He that feareth God, shall likewise have good friendship:
because according to him shall his friend be.</span></li>
<li><span>My son, from thy youth up receive instruction, and even
to thy grey hairs thou shalt find wisdom.</span></li>
<li><span>Come to her as one that plougheth, and soweth, and wait
for her good fruits:</span></li>
<li><span>For in working about her thou shalt labour a little, and
shalt quickly eat of her fruits.</span></li>
<li><span>How very unpleasant is wisdom to the unlearned, and the
unwise will not continue with her.</span></li>
<li><span>She shall be to them as a mighty stone of trial, and they
will cast her from them before it be long.</span></li>
<li><span>For the wisdom of doctrine is according to her name, and
she is not manifest unto many, but with them to whom she is known,

<li><span>Give ear, my son, and take wise counsel, and cast not
away my advice.</span></li>
<li><span>Put thy feet into her fetters, and thy neck into her
chains:</span></li>
<li><span>Bow down thy shoulder, and bear her, and be not grieved
with her bands.</span></li>
<li><span>Come to her with all thy mind, and keep her ways with all
thy power.</span></li>
<li><span>Search for her, and she shall be made known to thee, and
when thou hast gotten her, let her not go:</span></li>
<li><span>For in the latter end thou shalt find rest in her, and
she shall be turned to thy joy.</span></li>
<li><span>Then shall her fetters be a strong defence for thee, and
a firm foundation, and her chain a robe of glory:</span></li>
<li><span>For in her is the beauty of life, and her bands are a
healthful binding.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt put her on as a robe of glory, and thee shalt
set her upon thee as a crown of joy.</span></li>
<li><span>My son, if thou wilt attend to me, thou shalt learn: and
if thou wilt apply thy mind, thou shalt be wise.</span></li>
<li><span>If thou wilt incline thy ear, thou shalt receive
instruction: and if thou love to hear, thou shalt be
wise.</span></li>
<li><span>Stand in the multitude of ancients that are wise, and
join thyself from thy heart to their wisdom, that thou mayst hear
every discourse of God, and the sayings of praise may not escape
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And if thou see a man of understanding, go to him early
in the morning, and let thy foot wear the steps of his
doors.</span></li>
<li><span>Let thy thoughts be upon the precepts of God, and
meditate continually on his commandments: and he will give thee a
heart, and the desire of wisdom shall be given thee.</span></li>

<li><span>Say not: God will have respect to the multitude of my

<li><span>Number not thyself among the multitude of the

flesh of the ungodly is fire and worms.</span></li>
<li><span>Do not transgress against thy friend deferring money, nor
despise thy dear brother for the sake of gold.</span></li>

gotten in the fear of the Lord: for the grace of her modesty is
above gold.</span></li>

hired man that giveth thee his life.</span></li>
<li><span>Let a wise servant be dear to thee as thy own soul,
defraud him not of liberty, nor leave him needy.</span></li>
<li><span>Hast thou cattle? have an eye to them: and if they be for
thy profit, keep them with thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Hast thou children? instruct them, and bow down their
neck from their childhood.</span></li>
<li><span>Hast thou daughters? have a care of their body, and shew

and make a return to them as they have done for thee.</span></li>

priests.</span></li>

forsake not his ministers.</span></li>
<li><span>Honour God with all thy soul, and give honour to the
priests, and purify thyself with thy arms.</span></li>
<li><span>Give them their portion, as it is commanded thee, of the
firstfruits and of purifications: and for thy negligences purify
thyself with a few.</span></li>
<li><span>Offer to the Lord the gift of thy shoulders, and the
sacrifice of sanctification, and the firstfruits of the holy
things:</span></li>
<li><span>A gift hath grace in the sight of all the living, and
restrain not grace from the dead.</span></li>

and thy blessing may be perfected.</span></li>
<li><span>Be not wanting in comforting them that weep, and walk
with them that mourn.</span></li>
<li><span>Be not slow to visit the sick: for by these things thou
shalt be confirmed in love.</span></li>

<li><span>A wise judge shall judge his people, and the government
of a prudent man shall be steady.</span></li>
<li><span>As the judge of the people is himself, so also are his
ministers: and what manner of man the ruler of a city is, such also
are they that dwell therein.</span></li>
<li><span>An unwise king shall be the ruin of his people: and
cities shall be inhabited through the prudence of the
rulers.</span></li>
<li><span>The power of the earth is in the hand of God, and in his
time he will raise up a profitable ruler over it.</span></li>
<li><span>The prosperity of man is in the hand of God, and upon the
person of the scribe he shall lay his honour.</span></li>
<li><span>Remember not any injury done thee by thy neighbour, and
do thou nothing by deeds of injury.</span></li>
<li><span>Pride is hateful before God and men: and ah iniquity of
nations is execrable.</span></li>
<li><span>A kingdom is translated from one people to another,
because of injustices, and wrongs, and injuries, and divers
deceits.</span></li>
<li><span>But nothing is more wicked than the covetous man. Why is
earth and ashes proud?</span></li>
<li><span>There is not a more wicked thing than to love money: for
such a one setteth even his own soul to sale: because while he
liveth he hath cast away his bowels.</span></li>
<li><span>All power is of short life. A long sickness is
troublesome to the physician.</span></li>
<li><span>The physician cutteth off it short sickness: so also a
king is to day, and to morrow he shall die.</span></li>
<li><span>For when a man shall die, he shall inherit serpents, end
beasts, and worms.</span></li>
<li><span>The beginning of the pride of man, is to fall off from
God:</span></li>
<li><span>Because his heart is departed from him that made him: for
pride is the beginning of all sin: be that holdeth it, shall be
filled with maledictions, and it shall ruin him in the
end.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore hath the Lord disgraced the assemblies of the
wicked, and hath utterly destroyed them.</span></li>
<li><span>God hath overturned the thrones of proud princes, and
hath set up the meek in their stead.</span></li>
<li><span>God hath made the roots of proud nations to wither, and
hath planted the humble of these nations.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord hath overthrown the lands of the Gentiles, and
hath destroyed them even to the foundation.</span></li>
<li><span>He hath made some of them to wither away, and hath
destroyed them, and hath made the memory of them to cease from the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>God hath abolished the memory of the proud, and hath
preserved the memory of them that are humble in mind.</span></li>
<li><span>Pride was not made for men: nor wrath for the race of
women.</span></li>
<li><span>That seed of men shall be honoured, which feareth God:
but that seed shall be dishonoured, which transgresseth the
commandments of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>In the midst of brethren their chief is honourable: so
shall they that fear the Lord, be in his eyes.</span></li>
<li><span>The fear of God is the glory of the rich, and of the
honourable, and of the poor:</span></li>
<li><span>Despise not a just man that is poor, and do not magnify a
sinful man that is rich.</span></li>
<li><span>The great man, and the judge, and the mighty is in
honour: and there is none greater than he that feareth
God.</span></li>
<li><span>They that are free shall serve a servant that is wise:
and a man that is prudent and well instructed will not murmur when
he is reproved; and he that is ignorant, shall not be
honoured.</span></li>
<li><span>Extol not thyself in doing thy work, and linger not in
the time of distress:</span></li>
<li><span>Better is he that laboureth, and aboundeth in all things,
than he that boasteth himself and wanteth bread.</span></li>
<li><span>My son, keep thy soul in meekness, and give it honour
according to its desert.</span></li>
<li><span>Who will justify him that sinneth against his own soul?
and who will honour him that dishonoureth his own soul?</span></li>
<li><span>The poor man is glorified by his discipline and fear: and
there is a man that is honoured for his wealth.</span></li>
<li><span>But he that is glorified in poverty, how much more in
wealth? and he that is glorified in wealth, let him fear
poverty.</span></li>

<li><span>The bee is small among flying things, but her fruit hath

<li><span>Glory not in apparel at any time, and be not exalted in

<li><span>Many tyrants have sat on the throne, and he whom no man

<li><span>Before thou inquire, blame no man: and when thou hast

escape.</span></li>

and is in sorrow, and is so much the more in want.</span></li>
<li><span>Again, there is an inactive man that wanteth help, is
very weak in ability, and full of poverty:</span></li>
<li><span>Yet the eye of God hath looked upon him for good, and
hath lifted him up from his low estate, and hath exalted his head:
and many have wondered at him, and have glorified God.</span></li>
<li><span>Good things and evil, life and death, poverty and riches,
are from God.</span></li>
<li><span>Wisdom and discipline, and the knowledge of the law are
with God. Love and the ways of good things are with him</span></li>
<li><span>Error and darkness are created with sinners: and they
that glory in evil things, grow old in evil.</span></li>
<li><span>The gift of God abideth with the just, and his
advancement shall have success for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>There is one that is enriched by living sparingly, and
this is the portion of his reward.</span></li>
<li><span>In that he saith: I have found me rest, and now I will
eat of my goods alone:</span></li>
<li><span>And he knoweth not what time shall pass, and that death
approacheth, and that he must leave all to others, and shall
die.</span></li>
<li><span>Be steadfast in thy covenant, and be conversant therein,
and grow old in the work of thy commandments.</span></li>
<li><span>Abide not in the works of sinners. But trust in God, and
stay in thy place.</span></li>
<li><span>For it is easy in the eyes of God on a sudden to make the
poor man rich.</span></li>
<li><span>The blessing of God maketh haste to reward the just, and
in a swift hour his blessing beareth fruit.</span></li>
<li><span>Say not: What need I, and what good shall I have by
this?</span></li>
<li><span>Say not: I am sufficient for myself: and what shall I be
made worse by this?</span></li>
<li><span>In the day of good things be not unmindful of evils: and
in the day of evils be not unmindful of good things:</span></li>
<li><span>For it is easy before God in the day of death to reward
every one according to his ways.</span></li>
<li><span>The affliction of an hour maketh one forget great
delights, and in the end of a man is the disclosing of his
works.</span></li>
<li><span>Praise not any man before death, for a man is known by
his children.</span></li>
<li><span>Bring not every man into thy house: for many are the
snares of the deceitful.</span></li>
<li><span>For as corrupted bowels send forth stinking breath, and
as the partridge is brought into the cage, and as the roe into the
snare: so also is the heart of the proud, and as a spy that looketh
on the fall of his neighbour.</span></li>
<li><span>For he lieth in wait and turneth good into evil, and on
the elect he will lay a blot.</span></li>
<li><span>Of one spark cometh a great fire, and of one deceitful
man much blood: and a sinful man lieth in wait for
blood.</span></li>
<li><span>Take heed to thyself of a mischievous man, for he worketh
evils: lest he bring upon thee reproach for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>Receive a stranger in, and he shall overthrow thee with a
whirlwind, and shall turn thee out of thy own.</span></li>

hand, lest he turn into thy place, and seek to take thy seat: and
at the last thou acknowledge my words, and be pricked with my
sayings.</span></li>
<li><span>Who will pity an enchanter struck by a serpent, or any
that come near wild beasts? so is it with him that keepeth company
with a wicked man, and is involved in his sins.</span></li>
<li><span>For an hour he will abide with thee: but if thou begin to
decline, he will not endure it.</span></li>
<li><span>An enemy speaketh sweetly with his lips, but in his heart
he lieth in wait, to throw thee into a pit.</span></li>

acquaintance.</span></li>
<li><span>When a rich man hath been deceived, he hath many helpers:

him.</span></li>
<li><span>The poor man was deceived, and he is rebuked also: he

<li><span>The rich man spoke, and all held their peace, and what he

<li><span>The poor man spoke, and they say: Who is this? and if he

<li><span>Blessed is the man that hath not slipped by a word out of
his mouth, and is not pricked with the remorse of sin.</span></li>
<li><span>Happy is he that hath had no sadness of his mind, and who
is not fallen from his hope.</span></li>
<li><span>Riches are not comely for a covetous man and a niggard,
and what should an envious man do with gold?</span></li>
<li><span>He that gathereth together by wronging his own soul,
gathereth for others, and another will squander away his goods in
rioting.</span></li>
<li><span>He that is evil to himself, to whom will he be good? and
he shall not take pleasure in his goods.</span></li>
<li><span>There is none worse than he that envieth himself, and
this is the reward of his wickedness:</span></li>
<li><span>And if he do good, he doth it ignorantly, and
unwillingly: and at the last he discovereth his
wickedness.</span></li>
<li><span>The eye of the envious is wicked: and he turneth away his
face, and despiseth his own soul.</span></li>
<li><span>The eye of the covetous man is insatiable in his portion
of iniquity: he will not be satisfied till he consume his own soul,
drying it up.</span></li>
<li><span>An evil eye is towards evil things: and he shall not have
his fill of bread, but shall be needy and pensive at his own
table.</span></li>
<li><span>My son, if thou have any thing, do good to thyself, and
offer to God worthy offerings.</span></li>
<li><span>Remember that death is not slow, and that the covenant of
hell hath been shewn to thee: for the covenant of this world shall
surely die.</span></li>
<li><span>Do good to thy friend before thou die, and according to
thy ability, stretching out thy hand give to the poor.</span></li>
<li><span>Defraud not thyself of the good day, and let not the part
of a good gift over- pass thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Shalt thou not leave to others to divide by lot thy
sorrows and labours?</span></li>
<li><span>Give and take, and justify thy soul.</span></li>
<li><span>Before thy death work justice: for in hell there is no
finding food.</span></li>
<li><span>All flesh shall fade as grass, and as the leaf that
springeth out on a green tree.</span></li>
<li><span>Some grow, and some fall off: so is the generation of
flesh and blood, one cometh to an end, and another is
born.</span></li>
<li><span>Every work that is corruptible shall fail in the end: and
the worker thereof shall go with it.</span></li>
<li><span>And every excellent work shall be justified: and the
worker thereof shall be honoured therein.</span></li>
<li><span>Blessed is the man that shall continue in wisdom, and
that shall meditate in his justice, and in his mind shall think of
the all seeing eye of God.</span></li>
<li><span>He that considereth her ways in his heart, and hath
understanding in her secrets, who goeth after her as one that
traceth, and stayeth in her ways:</span></li>
<li><span>He who looketh in at her windows, and hearkeneth at her
door:</span></li>
<li><span>He that lodgeth near her house, and fastening a pin in
her walls shall set up his tent nigh unto her, where good things
shall rest in his lodging for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>He shall set his children under her shelter, and shall
lodge under her branches:</span></li>

<li><span>With the bread of life and understanding, she shall feed
him, and give him the water of wholesome wisdom to drink: and she

<li><span>And in the midst of the church she shall open his mouth,
and shall fill him with the spirit of wisdom and understanding, and

<li><span>She shall heap upon him a treasure of joy and gladness,
and shall cause him to inherit an everlasting name.</span></li>
<li><span>But foolish men shall not obtain her, and wise men shall

<li><span>Praise is not seemly in the mouth of a

do not thou the things that he hateth.</span></li>
<li><span>Say not: He hath caused me to err: for he hath no need of
wicked men.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord hateth all abomination of error, and they that
fear him shall not love it.</span></li>
<li><span>God made man from the beginning, and left him in the hand
of his own counsel.</span></li>
<li><span>He added his commandments and precepts.</span></li>
<li><span>If thou wilt keep the commandments and perform acceptable
fidelity for ever, they shall preserve thee.</span></li>
<li><span>He hath set water and fire before thee: stretch forth thy
hand to which thou wilt.</span></li>
<li><span>Before man is life and death, good and evil, that which
he shall choose shall be given him:</span></li>
<li><span>For the wisdom of God is great, and he is strong in
power, seeing all men without ceasing.</span></li>
<li><span>The eyes of the Lord are towards them that fear him, and
he knoweth all the work of man.</span></li>
<li><span>He hath commanded no man to do wickedly, and he hath
given no man license to sin:</span></li>

<li><span>By one that is wise a country shall be inhabited, the

<li><span>Many such things hath my eyes seen, and greater things

<li><span>In the congregation of sinners a fire shall be kindled,

who were destroyed trusting to their own strength:</span></li>

abhorred them for the pride of their word.</span></li>
<li><span>He had not pity on them, destroying the whole nation that
extolled them- selves in their sine.</span></li>
<li><span>So did he with the six hundred thousand footmen, who were
gathered together in the hardness of their heart: and if one had
been stiffnecked, it is a wonder if he had escaped
unpunished:</span></li>
<li><span>For mercy and wrath are with him. He is mighty to
forgive, and to pour out indignation:</span></li>
<li><span>According as his mercy is, so his correction judgeth a
man according to his works.</span></li>
<li><span>The sinner shall not escape in his rapines, and the
patience of him that sheweth mercy shall not be put
off.</span></li>
<li><span>All mercy shall make a place for every man according to
the merit of his works, and according to the wisdom of his
sojournment.</span></li>
<li><span>Say not: I shall be hidden from God. and who shall

<li><span>Behold the heaven, and the heavens of heavens, the deep,

in his sight,</span></li>

the earth: when God shall look upon them, they shall be shaken with
trembling.</span></li>
<li><span>And in all these things the heart is senseless: and every
heart is understood by him:</span></li>
<li><span>And his ways who shall understand, and the storm, which
no eye of man see?</span></li>
<li><span>For many of his works are hidden: hut the works of his
justice who shall declare? or who shall endure? for the testament
is far from some, and the examination of all is in the
end.</span></li>
<li><span>He that wanteth understanding thinketh vain things: and
the foolish, and erring man, thinketh foolish things.</span></li>
<li><span>Hearken to me, my son, and learn the discipline of
understanding, and attend to my words in thy heart.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will shew forth good doctrine in equity, and will
seek to declare wisdom: and attend to my words in thy heart, whilst
with equity of spirit I tell thee the virtues that God hath put
upon his works from the beginning, and I shew forth in truth his
knowledge.</span></li>
<li><span>The works of God are done in judgment from the beginning,
and from the making of them he distinguished their parts, and their
beginnings in their generations.</span></li>
<li><span>He beautified their works for ever, they have neither
hungered, nor laboured, and they have not ceased from their
works.</span></li>
<li><span>Nor shall any of them straiten his neighbour at any
time.</span></li>
<li><span>Be not thou incredulous to his word.</span></li>
<li><span>After this God looked upon the earth, and filled it with
his goods.</span></li>
<li><span>The soul of every living thing hath shewn forth before
the face thereof, and into it they return again.</span></li>

<li><span>God created man of the earth, and made him after his own
image.</span></li>
<li><span>And he turned him into it again, and clothed him with
strength according to himself.</span></li>
<li><span>He gave him the number of his days and time, and gave him
power over all things that are upon the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>He put the fear of him upon all flesh, and he had
dominion over beasts and fowls.</span></li>
<li><span>He created of him a helpmate like to himself: he gave
them counsel, and a tongue, and eyes, and ears, and a heart to
devise: and he filled them with the knowledge of
understanding.</span></li>
<li><span>He created in them the science of the spirit, he filled
their heart with wisdom, and shewed them both good and
evil.</span></li>
<li><span>He set his eye upon their hearts to shew them the
greatness of his works:</span></li>
<li><span>That they might praise the name which he hath sanctified:
and glory in his wondrous acts, that they might declare the
glorious things of his works.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover he gave them instructions, and the law of life
for an inheritance.</span></li>
<li><span>He made an everlasting covenant with them, and he shewed
them his justice and judgments.</span></li>
<li><span>And their eye saw the majesty of his glory. and their
ears heard his glorious voice, and he said to them: Beware of all
iniquity.</span></li>
<li><span>And he gave to every one of them commandment concerning
his neighbour.</span></li>
<li><span>Their ways are always before him, they are not hidden
from his eyes.</span></li>
<li><span>Over every nation he set a ruler.</span></li>
<li><span>And Israel was made the manifest portion of
God.</span></li>
<li><span>And all their works are as the sun in the sight of God:

<li><span>Their covenants were not hid by their iniquity, and all
their iniquities are in the sight of God.</span></li>
<li><span>The alms of a man is as a signet with him, and shall
preserve the grace of a man as the apple of the eye:</span></li>
<li><span>And afterward he shall rise up, and shall render them
their reward, to every one upon their own head, and shall turn them
down into the bowels of the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>But to the penitent he hath given the way of justice, and
he hath strengthened them that were fainting in patience, and hath
appointed to them the lot of truth.</span></li>
<li><span>Turn to the Lord, and forsake thy sins:</span></li>
<li><span>Make thy prayer before the face of the Lord, and offend
less.</span></li>
<li><span>Return to the Lord, and turn away from thy injustice, and
greatly hate abomination.</span></li>
<li><span>And know the justices and judgments of God, and stand
firm in the lot set before thee, and in prayer to the most high
God.</span></li>
<li><span>Go to the side of the holy age, with them that live and
give praise to God.</span></li>
<li><span>Tarry not in the error of the ungodly, give glory before
death. Praise perisheth from the dead as nothing.</span></li>
<li><span>Give thanks whilst thou art living, whilst thou art alive
and in health thou shalt give thanks, and shalt praise God, and

to them that turn to him I</span></li>

is not immortal, and they are delighted with the vanity of
evil.</span></li>
<li><span>What is brighter than the sun; yet it shall be eclipsed.
Or what is more wicked than that which flesh and blood hath
invented? and this shall be reproved.</span></li>

wicked, and hath known their end that it is evil.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore bath he filled up his mercy in their favour,

<li><span>He hath mercy, and teacheth, and correcteth, as a
shepherd doth his hock.</span></li>
<li><span>He hath mercy on him that receiveth the discipline of
mercy, and that maketh haste in his judgments.</span></li>
<li><span>My son, in thy good deeds, make no complaint, and when

examine thyself, and thou shalt find mercy in the sight of

sickness shew thy conversation.</span></li>
<li><span>Let nothing hinder thee from praying always, and be not
afraid to be justified even to death: for the reward of God
continueth for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>Before prayer prepare thy soul: and be not as a man that
tempteth God.</span></li>
<li><span>Remember the wrath that shall be at the last day, and the
time of repaying when he shall turn away his face.</span></li>
<li><span>Remember poverty is the time of abundance, and the
necessities of poverty in the day of riches.</span></li>
<li><span>From the morning until the evening the time shall be
changed, and all these are swift in the eyes of God.</span></li>
<li><span>A wise man will fear in every thing, and in the days of
sine will beware of sloth.</span></li>
<li><span>Every man of understanding knoweth wisdom, and will give
praise to him that findeth her.</span></li>
<li><span>They that were of good understanding in words, have also
done wisely themselves: and have understood truth and justice, and
have poured forth pro- verbs and judgments.</span></li>
<li><span>Go not after thy lusts, but turn away from thy own
will.</span></li>
<li><span>If thou give to thy soul her desires, she will make thee

<li><span>Wisdom that is hid, and treasure that is not seen: what
profit is there in them both?</span></li>
<li><span>Better is he that hideth his folly, than the man that
hideth his wisdom.</span></li>

<li><span>My son, hast thou sinned? do so no more: but for thy
former sins also pray that they may be forgiven thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Flee from sins as from the face of a serpent: for if thou
comest near them, they will take hold of thee.</span></li>
<li><span>The teeth thereof are the teeth of a lion, killing the
souls of men.</span></li>
<li><span>All iniquity is like a two-edged sword, there is no
remedy for the wound thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>Injuries and wrongs will waste riches: and the house that
is very rich shall be brought to nothing by pride : so the
substance of the proud shall be rooted out.</span></li>
<li><span>The prayer out of the mouth of the poor shall reach the
ears of God, and judgment shall come for him speedily.</span></li>
<li><span>He that hateth to be reproved walketh in the trace of a
sinner: and he that feareth God will turn to his own
heart.</span></li>
<li><span>He that is mighty by a bold tongue is known afar off, but
a wise man knoweth to slip by him.</span></li>
<li><span>He that buildeth his house at other men's charges, is as
he that gathereth himself stones to build in the
winter.</span></li>
<li><span>The congregation of sinners is like tow heaped together,
and the end of them is a flame of fire.</span></li>
<li><span>The way of sinners is made plain with stones, and in
their end is hell, and darkness, and pains.</span></li>
<li><span>He that keepeth justice shall get the understanding
thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>The perfection of the fear of God is wisdom and
understanding.</span></li>
<li><span>He that is not wise in good, will not be
taught.</span></li>
<li><span>But there is a wisdom that aboundeth in evil : and there
is no understanding where there is bitterness.</span></li>
<li><span>The knowledge of a wise man shall abound like a flood,
and his counsel continueth like a fountain of life.</span></li>
<li><span>The heart of a fool is like a broken vessel, and no
wisdom at all shall it hold.</span></li>
<li><span>A man of sense will praise every wise word he shall hear,
and will apply it to himself: the luxurious man hath heard it, and
it shall displease him, and he will cast it behind his
back.</span></li>
<li><span>The talking of a fool is like a burden in the way: but in
the lips of the wise, grace shall be found.</span></li>
<li><span>The mouth of the prudent is sought after in the church,
and they will think upon his words in their hearts.</span></li>
<li><span>As a house that is destroyed, so is wisdom to a fool :
and the knowledge of the unwise is as words without
sense.</span></li>
<li><span>Doctrine to a fool is as fetters on the feet, and like
manacles on the right hand.</span></li>
<li><span>A fool lifteth up his voice in laughter: but a wise man
will scarce laugh low to himself.</span></li>
<li><span>Learning to the prudent is as an ornament of gold, and
like a bracelet upon his right arm.</span></li>
<li><span>The foot of a fool is soon in his neighbour's house: but
a man of experience will be abashed at the person of the
mighty.</span></li>
<li><span>A fool will peep through the window into the house: but
he that is well taught will stand without.</span></li>
<li><span>It is the folly of a man to hearken at the door: and a
wise man will be grieved with the disgrace.</span></li>
<li><span>The lips of the unwise will be telling foolish things but
the words of the wise shall be weighed in a balance.</span></li>
<li><span>The heart of fools is in their mouth: and the mouth of
wise men is in their heart.</span></li>
<li><span>While the ungodly curseth the devil, he curseth his own
soul.</span></li>
<li><span>The talebearer shall defile his own soul, and shall be
hated by all: and he that shall abide with him shall be hateful:
the silent and wise man shall be honoured.</span></li>

<li><span>The sluggard is pelted with a dirty stone, and all men
will speak of his disgrace.</span></li>
<li><span>The sluggard is pelted with the dung of oxen: and every
one that toucheth him will shake his hands.</span></li>
<li><span>A son ill taught is the confusion of the father: and a
foolish daughter shall be to his loss.</span></li>
<li><span>A wise daughter shall bring an inheritance to her
husband: but she that confoundeth, becometh a disgrace to her
father.</span></li>
<li><span>She that is bold shameth both her father and husband, and
will not be inferior to the ungodly: and shall be disgraced by them
both.</span></li>
<li><span>A tale out of time is like music in mourning: but the
stripes and instruction of wisdom are never out of
time.</span></li>
<li><span>He that teacheth a fool, is like one that glueth a
potsherd together.</span></li>
<li><span>He that telleth a word to him that heareth not, is like
one that waketh a man out of a deep sleep.</span></li>
<li><span>He speaketh with one that is asleep, who uttereth wisdom
to a fool: and in the end of the discourse he saith: Who is
this?</span></li>
<li><span>Weep for the dead, for his light hath failed: and weep
for the fool, for his understanding faileth.</span></li>
<li><span>Weep but a little for the dead, for he is at
rest.</span></li>
<li><span>For the wicked life of a wicked fool is worse than
death.</span></li>
<li><span>The mourning for the dead is seven days: but for a fool
and an ungodly man all the days of their life.</span></li>
<li><span>Talk not much with a fool, and go not with him that hath
no sense.</span></li>
<li><span>Keep thyself from him, that thou mayst not have trouble,
and thou shalt not be defiled with his sin.</span></li>
<li><span>Turn away from him, and thou shalt find rest, and shalt
not be wearied out with his folly.</span></li>
<li><span>What is heavier than lead? and what other name hath he
but fool?</span></li>
<li><span>Sand and salt, and a mass of iron is easier to bear, than
a man without sense, that is both foolish and wicked.</span></li>
<li><span>A frame of wood bound together in the foundation of a
building, shall not be loosed: so neither shall the heart that is
established by advised counsel.</span></li>
<li><span>The thought of him that is wise at all times, shall not
be depraved by fear.</span></li>
<li><span>As pales set in high places, and plasterings made without
cost, will not stand against the face of the wind:</span></li>
<li><span>So also a fearful heart in the imagination of a fool
shall not resist against the violence of fear.</span></li>
<li><span>As a fearful heart in the thought of a fool at all times
will not fear, so neither shall he that continueth always in the
commandments of God.</span></li>
<li><span>He that pricketh the eye, bringeth out tears: and he that
pricketh the heart, bringeth forth resentment.</span></li>
<li><span>He that flingeth a stone at birds, shall drive them away:
so he that upbraideth his friend, breaketh friendship.</span></li>
<li><span>Although thou hast drawn a sword at a friend, despair
not: for there may be a returning. To a friend,</span></li>
<li><span>If thou hast opened a sad mouth, fear not, for there may
be a reconciliation: except upbraiding, and reproach, and pride,
and disclosing of secrets, or a treacherous wound: for in all these
cases a friend will flee away.</span></li>
<li><span>Keep fidelity with a friend in his poverty, that in his
prosperity also thou mayst rejoice.</span></li>
<li><span>In the time of his trouble continue faithful to him, that
thou mayst also be heir with him in his inheritance.</span></li>
<li><span>As the vapour of a chimney, and the smoke of the fire
goeth up before the fire: so also injurious words, and reproaches,
and threats, before blood.</span></li>
<li><span>I will not be ashamed to salute a friend, neither will I
hide myself from his face: and if any evil happen to me by him, I
will bear it.</span></li>
<li><span>But every one that shall hear it, will beware of
him.</span></li>
<li><span>Who will set a guard before my mouth, and a sure seal
upon my lips, that I fall not by them, and that my tongue destroy
me not?</span></li>

<li><span>O Lord, father, and sovereign ruler of my life, leave me
not to their counsel: nor suffer me to fall by them.</span></li>
<li><span>Who will set scourges over my thoughts, and the
discipline of wisdom over my heart, that they spare me not in their
ignorances, and that their sine may not appear:</span></li>
<li><span>Lest my ignorances increase, and my offences be
multiplied, and my sine abound, and I fall before my adversaries,
and my enemy rejoice over me?</span></li>
<li><span>O Lord, father, and God of my life, leave me not to their
devices.</span></li>
<li><span>Give me not haughtiness of my eyes, and turn away from me
all coveting.</span></li>
<li><span>Take from me the greediness of the belly, and let not the
lusts of the flesh take hold of me, and give me not over to a
shameless and foolish mind.</span></li>
<li><span>Hear, O ye children, the discipline of the mouth: and he
that will keep it shall not perish by his lips, nor be brought to
fall into most wicked works.</span></li>
<li><span>A sinner is caught in his own vanity, and the proud and
the evil speakers shall fall thereby.</span></li>
<li><span>Let not thy mouth be accustomed to swearing: for in it
there are many falls.</span></li>
<li><span>And let not the naming of God be usual in thy mouth, and
meddle not with the names of saints, for thou shalt not escape free
from them.</span></li>
<li><span>For as a slave daily put to the question, is never
without a blue mark: so every one that sweareth, and nameth, shall
not be wholly pure from sin.</span></li>
<li><span>A man that sweareth much, shall be filled with iniquity,
and a scourge shall not depart from his house.</span></li>
<li><span>And if he make it void, his sin shall be upon him: and if
he dissemble it, he offendeth double:</span></li>
<li><span>And if he swear in vain, he shall not be justified: for
his house shall be filled with his punishment.</span></li>
<li><span>There is also another speech opposite to death, let it
not be found in the inheritance of Jacob.</span></li>
<li><span>For from the merciful all these things shall be taken
away, and they shall not wallow in sins.</span></li>
<li><span>Let not thy mouth be accustomed to indiscreet speech: for
therein is the word of sin.</span></li>
<li><span>Remember thy father and thy mother, for thou sittest is
the midst of great men:</span></li>
<li><span>Lest God forget thee in their sight, and thou, by thy
daily custom, be infatuated and suffer reproach: and wish that thou
hadst not been born, and curse the day of thy nativity.</span></li>
<li><span>The man that is accustomed to opprobrious words, will
never be corrected all the days of his life.</span></li>
<li><span>Two sorts of men multiply sins, and the third bringeth
wrath and destruction.</span></li>
<li><span>A hot soul is a burning fire, it will never be quenched,
till it devour some thing.</span></li>
<li><span>And a man that is wicked in the mouth of his flesh, will
not leave off till he hath kindled a fire.</span></li>
<li><span>To a man that is a fornicator all bread is sweet, he will
not be weary of sinning unto the end.</span></li>
<li><span>Every man that passeth beyond his own bed, despising his
own soul, and saying: Who seeth me?</span></li>
<li><span>Darkness compasseth me about, and the walls cover me, and
no man seeth me: whom do I fear? the most High will not remember my
sins.</span></li>
<li><span>And he understandeth not that his eye seeth all things,
for such a man's fear driveth from him the fear of God, and the
eyes of men fearing him:</span></li>
<li><span>And he knoweth not that the eyes of the Lord are far
brighter than the sun, beholding round about all the ways of men,
and the bottom of the deep, and looking into the hearts of men,
into the most hidden parts.</span></li>
<li><span>For all things were known to the Lord God, before they
were created: so also after they were perfected he beholdeth all
things.</span></li>
<li><span>This man shall be punished in the streets of the city,
and he shall be chased as a colt: and where he suspected not, he
shall be taken.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall be in disgrace with all men, because he
understood not the fear of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>So every woman also that leaveth her husband, and
bringeth in an heir by another :</span></li>
<li><span>For first she hath been unfaithful to the law of the most
High: and secondly, she hath offended against her husband: thirdly,
she hath fornicated in adultery, end hath gotten her children of
another man.</span></li>
<li><span>This woman shall be brought into the assembly, and
inquisition shall be made of her children.</span></li>
<li><span>Her children shall not take root, and her branches shall
bring forth no fruit.</span></li>
<li><span>She shall leave her memory to be cursed, and her infamy
shall not be blotted out.</span></li>
<li><span>And they that remain shall know. that there is nothing
better than the fear of God: and that there is nothing sweeter than
to have regard to the commandments of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>It is great glory to follow the Lord for length of days
shall be received from him.</span></li>

<li><span>Wisdom shall praise her own self, and shall be honoured
in God, and shall glory in the midst of her people,</span></li>
<li><span>And shall open her mouth in the churches of the most
High, and shall glorify herself in the sight of his
power,</span></li>
<li><span>And in the midst of her own people she shall be exalted,
and shall be ad- mired in the holy assembly.</span></li>
<li><span>And in the multitude of the elect she shall have praise,
and among the blessed she shall be blessed, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>I came out of the mouth of the most High, the firstborn
before all creatures:</span></li>
<li><span>I made that in the heavens there should rise light that
never faileth, and as a cloud I covered all the earth:</span></li>
<li><span>I dwelt in the highest places, and my throne is in a
pillar of a cloud.</span></li>
<li><span>I alone have compassed the circuit of heaven, and have
penetrated into the bottom of the deep, and have walked in the
waves of the sea,</span></li>
<li><span>And have stood in all the earth: and in every
people,</span></li>
<li><span>And in every nation I have had the chief
rule:</span></li>
<li><span>And by my power I have trodden under my feet the hearts
of all the high and low: and in all these I sought rest, and I
shall abide in the inheritance of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Then the creator of all things commanded, and said to me:
and he that made me, rested in my tabernacle,</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to me: Let thy dwelling be in Jacob, and thy
inheritance in Israel, and take root in my elect.</span></li>
<li><span>From the beginning, and before the world, was I created,
and unto the world to come I shall not cease to be, and in the holy
dwelling place I have ministered before him.</span></li>
<li><span>And so was I established in Sion, and in the holy city
likewise I rested, and my power was in Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And I took root in an honourable people, and in the
portion of mg God his inheritance, and my abode is in the full
assembly of saints.</span></li>
<li><span>I was exalted like a cedar in Libanus, and as a cypress
tree on mount Sion.</span></li>
<li><span>I was exalted like a palm tree in Cades, and as a rose
plant in Jericho:</span></li>
<li><span>As a fair olive tree in the plains, and as a plane tree
by the water in the streets, was I exalted.</span></li>
<li><span>I gave a sweet smell like cinnamon. and aromatical balm:
I yielded a sweet odour like the best myrrh:</span></li>
<li><span>And I perfumed my dwelling as storax, and galbanum, and
onyx, and aloes, and as the frankincense not cut, and my odour is
as the purest balm.</span></li>
<li><span>I have stretched out my branches as the turpentine tree,
and my branches are of honour and grace.</span></li>
<li><span>As the vine I have brought forth a pleasant odour: and my
flowers are the fruit of honour and riches.</span></li>
<li><span>I am the mother of fair love, and of fear, and of
knowledge, and of holy hope.</span></li>
<li><span>In me is all grace of the way and of the truth, in me is
all hope of life and of virtue.</span></li>
<li><span>Come over to me, all ye that desire me, and be filled
with my fruits.</span></li>
<li><span>For my spirit is sweet above honey, and my inheritance
above honey and the honeycomb.</span></li>
<li><span>My memory is unto everlasting generations.</span></li>
<li><span>They that eat me, shall yet hunger: and they that drink
me, shall yet thirst.</span></li>
<li><span>He that hearkeneth to me, shall not be confounded: and
they that work by me, shall not sin.</span></li>
<li><span>They that explain me shall have life
everlasting.</span></li>
<li><span>All these things are the book of life, and the covenant
of the most High, and the knowledge of truth.</span></li>
<li><span>Moses commanded a law in the precepts of justices, and an
inheritance to the house of Jacob, and the promises to
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>He appointed to David his servant to raise up of him a
most mighty king, and sitting on the throne of glory for
ever.</span></li>
<li><span>Who filleth up wisdom as the Phison, and as the Tigris in
the days of the new fruits.</span></li>
<li><span>Who maketh understanding to abound as the Euphrates, who
multiplieth it as the Jordan in the time of harvest.</span></li>
<li><span>Who sendeth knowledge as the light, and riseth up as
Gehon in the time of the vintage.</span></li>
<li><span>Who first hath perfect knowledge of her, and a weaker
shall not search her out.</span></li>
<li><span>For her thoughts are more vast than the sea, and her
counsels more deep than the great ocean.</span></li>
<li><span>I, wisdom, have poured out rivers.</span></li>
<li><span>I, like a brook out of a river of a mighty water; I, like
a channel of a river. and like an aqueduct, came out of
paradise.</span></li>
<li><span>I said: I will water my garden of plants, and I will
water abundantly the fruits of my meadow.</span></li>
<li><span>And behold my brook became a great river, and my river
came near to a sea:</span></li>
<li><span>For I make doctrine to shine forth to all as the morning
light, and I will declare it afar off.</span></li>
<li><span>I will penetrate to all the lower parts of the earth, and
will behold all that sleep, and will enlighten all that hope in the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>I will yet pour out doctrine as prophecy, and will leave
it to them that seek wisdom, and will not cease to instruct their
offspring even to the holy age.</span></li>
<li><span>See ye that I have not laboured for myself only, but for
all that seek out the truth.</span></li>

<li><span>With three things my spirit is pleased, which are
approved before God and men:</span></li>
<li><span>The concord of brethren, and the love of neighbours, and
mall and wife that agree well together.</span></li>
<li><span>Three sorts my soul hateth, and I am greatly grieved at
their life:</span></li>
<li><span>A poor man that is proud: a rich man that is a liar: an
old man that is a fool, and doting.</span></li>
<li><span>The things that thou hast not gathered in thy youth, how
shalt thou find them in thy old age?</span></li>
<li><span>O how comely is judgment for a grey head, and for
ancients to know counsel!</span></li>
<li><span>O how comely is wisdom for the aged, and understanding
and counsel to men of honour!</span></li>
<li><span>Much experience is the crown of old men, and the fear of
God is their glory.</span></li>
<li><span>Nine things that are not to be imagined by the heart have
I magnified, and the tenth I will utter to men with my
tongue.</span></li>
<li><span>A man that hath joy of his children: and he that liveth
and seeth the fall of his enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>Blessed is he. that dwelleth with a wise woman, and that
hath not slipped with his tongue, and that hath not served such as
are unworthy of him.</span></li>
<li><span>Blessed is he that findeth a true friend, and that
declareth justice to an ear that heareth.</span></li>
<li><span>How great is he that findeth wisdom and knowledge! but
there is none above him that feareth the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>The fear of God hath set itself above all
things:</span></li>
<li><span>Blessed is the man, to whom it is given to have the fear
of God: he that holdeth it, to whom shall he be
likened?</span></li>
<li><span>The fear of God is the beginning of his love: and the
beginning of faith is to be fast joined unto it.</span></li>
<li><span>The sadness of the heart is every plague: and the
wickedness of a woman is all evil.</span></li>
<li><span>And a man will choose any plague, but the plague of the
heart:</span></li>
<li><span>And ally wickedness, but the wickedness of a
woman:</span></li>
<li><span>And any affliction, but the affliction from them that
hate him:</span></li>
<li><span>And ally revenge, but the revenge of enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>There is no head worse than the head of a
serpent:</span></li>
<li><span>And there is no anger above the anger of a woman. It will
be more agreeable to abide with a lion and a dragon, than to dwell
with a wicked woman.</span></li>
<li><span>The wickedness of a woman changeth her face: and she
darkeneth her countenance as a bear: and sheweth it like sackcloth.
In the midst of her neighbours,</span></li>
<li><span>Her husband groaned, and hearing he sighed a
little.</span></li>
<li><span>All malice is shore to the malice of a woman, let the lot
of sinners fall upon her.</span></li>
<li><span>As the climbing of a sandy way is to the feet of the
aged, so is a wife full of tongue to a quiet man.</span></li>
<li><span>Look not upon a woman's beauty, and desire not a woman
for beauty.</span></li>
<li><span>A woman's anger, and impudence, and confusion is
great.</span></li>
<li><span>A woman, if she have superiority, is contrary to her
husband.</span></li>
<li><span>A wicked woman abateth the courage, and maketh a heavy
countenance, and a wounded heart.</span></li>
<li><span>Feeble hands, and disjointed knees, a woman that doth not
make her husband happy.</span></li>
<li><span>From the woman came the beginning of sin, and by her we
all die.</span></li>
<li><span>Give no issue to thy water, no, not a little: nor to a
wicked woman liberty to gad abroad.</span></li>
<li><span>If she walk not at thy hand, she will confound thee in
the sight of thy enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>Cut her off from thy flesh, lest she always abuse
thee.</span></li>

<li><span>Happy is the husband of a good wife: for the number of
his years is double.</span></li>

the years of his life in peace.</span></li>
<li><span>A good wife is a good portion, she shall be given in the
portion of them that fear God, to a man for his good
deeds.</span></li>
<li><span>Rich or poor, if his heart is good, his countenance shall
be cheerful at all times.</span></li>
<li><span>Of three things my heart hath been afraid, and at the
fourth my face hath trembled:</span></li>
<li><span>The accusation of a city, and the gathering together of
the people:</span></li>
<li><span>And a false calumny, all are more grievous than
death.</span></li>
<li><span>A jealous woman is the grief and mourning of the
heart.</span></li>
<li><span>With a jealous woman is a scourge of the tongue which
communicateth with all.</span></li>
<li><span>As a yoke of oxen that is moved to and fro, so also is a
wicked woman: he that hath hold of her, is as he that taketh hold
of a scorpion.</span></li>
<li><span>A drunken woman is a great wrath: and her reproach and
shame shall not be hid.</span></li>
<li><span>The fornication of a woman shall be known by the
haughtiness of her eyes, and by her eyelids.</span></li>
<li><span>On a daughter that turneth not away herself, set a strict
watch: lest finding an opportunity she abuse herself.</span></li>
<li><span>Take heed of the impudence of her eyes, and wonder not if
she slight thee.</span></li>
<li><span>She will open her mouth as a thirsty traveller to the
fountain, and will drink of every water near her, and will sit down
by every hedge, and open her quiver against every arrow, until she
fail.</span></li>
<li><span>The grace of a diligent woman shall delight her husband,
and shall fat his bones.</span></li>
<li><span>Her discipline is the gift of God.</span></li>
<li><span>Such is a wise and silent woman, and there is nothing so
much worth as a well instructed soul.</span></li>
<li><span>A holy and shamefaced woman is grace upon
grace.</span></li>
<li><span>And no price is worthy of a continent soul.</span></li>
<li><span>As the sun when it riseth to the world in the high places
of God, so is the beauty of a good wife for the ornament of her
house.</span></li>
<li><span>As the lamp shining upon the holy candlestick, so is the
beauty of the face in a ripe age.</span></li>
<li><span>As golden pillars upon bases of silver, so are the firm
feet upon the soles of a steady woman.</span></li>
<li><span>As everlasting foundations upon a solid rock, so the
commandments of God In the heart of a holy woman.</span></li>
<li><span>At two things my heart is grieved, and the third bringeth
anger upon me:</span></li>
<li><span>A man of was fainting through poverty: and a man of sense
despised:</span></li>
<li><span>And he that passeth over from justice to sin, God hath
prepared such an one for the sword.</span></li>
<li><span>Two sorts of callings have appeared to me hard and
dangerous: a merchant is hardly free from negligence: and a
huckster shall not be justified from the sins of the

<li><span>Through poverty many have sinned: and he that seeketh to
be enriched, turneth away his eye.</span></li>
<li><span>As a stake sticketh fast in the midst of the joining of
stones, so also in the midst of selling and buying, sin shall stick
fast.</span></li>
<li><span>Sin shall be destroyed with the sinner.</span></li>
<li><span>Unless thou hold thyself diligently in the fear of the
Lord, thy house shall quickly be overthrown.</span></li>
<li><span>As when one sifteth with a sieve, the dust will remain:
so will the perplexity of a man in his thoughts.</span></li>
<li><span>The furnace trieth the potter's vessels, and the trial of
affliction just men.</span></li>
<li><span>Be the dressing of a tree sheweth the fruit thereof, so a
word out of the thought of the heart of man.</span></li>
<li><span>Praise not a man before he speaketh, for this is the
trial of men.</span></li>
<li><span>If thou followest justice, thou shalt obtain her: and
shalt put her on as a long robe of honour, and thou shalt dwell
with her: and she shall protect thee for ever, and in the day of
acknowledgment thou shalt find a strong foundation.</span></li>
<li><span>Birds resort unto their like: so truth will return to
them that practise her.</span></li>
<li><span>The lion always lieth in wait for prey: so do sine for
them that work iniquities.</span></li>
<li><span>A holy man continueth in wisdom as the sun: but a fool is
changed as the moon.</span></li>
<li><span>In the midst of the unwise keep in the word till its
time: but be continually among men that think.</span></li>
<li><span>The discourse of sinners is hateful, and their laughter
is at the pleasures of sin.</span></li>
<li><span>The speech that sweareth much shall make the hair of the
head stand upright: and its irreverence shall make one stop his
ears.</span></li>
<li><span>Is the quarrels of the proud is the shedding of blood:
and their cursing is a grievous hearing.</span></li>
<li><span>He that discloseth the secret of a friend loseth his
credit, and shall never find a friend to his mind.</span></li>
<li><span>Love thy neighbour, and be joined to him with
fidelity.</span></li>
<li><span>But if thou discover his secrets, follow no more after
him.</span></li>
<li><span>For as a man that destroyeth his friend, so also is he
that destroyeth the friendship of his neighbour.</span></li>
<li><span>And as one that letteth a bird go out of his hand, so
hast thou let thy neighbour go, and thou shalt not get him
again.</span></li>
<li><span>Follow after him no more, for he is gone afar off, he is
fled, as a roe escaped out of the snare: because his soul is
wounded.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou canst no more bind him up. And of a curse there is
reconciliation:</span></li>
<li><span>But to disclose the secrets of a friend, leaveth no hope
to an unhappy soul.</span></li>
<li><span>He that winketh with the eye forgeth wicked things, and
no man will cast him off:</span></li>
<li><span>In the sight of thy eyes he will sweeten his mouth, and
will admire thy words: but at the last he will writhe his mouth,
and on thy words he will lay a stumblingblock.</span></li>
<li><span>I have hated many things, but not like him, and the Lord
will hate him.</span></li>
<li><span>If one cast a stone on high, it will fall upon his own
head: and the deceitful stroke will wound the
deceitful.</span></li>
<li><span>He that diggeth a pit, shall fall into it: and he that
setteth a stone for his neighbour, shall stumble upon it: and he
that layeth a snare for another, shall perish in it.</span></li>
<li><span>A mischievous counsel shall be rolled back upon the
author, and he shall not know from whence it cometh to
him.</span></li>
<li><span>Mockery and reproach are of the proud, and vengeance as a
lion shall lie in wait for him.</span></li>
<li><span>They shall perish in a snare that are delighted with the
fall of the just: and sorrow shall consume them before they
die.</span></li>
<li><span>Anger and fury are both of them abominable, and the
sinful man shall be subject to them.</span></li>

<li><span>He that seeketh to revenge himself, shall find vengeance
from the Lord, and he will surely keep his sins in
remembrance.</span></li>
<li><span>Forgive thy neighbour if he hath hurl thee: and then
shall thy sins be forgiven to thee when thou prayest.</span></li>
<li><span>Man to man reserveth anger, and doth he seek remedy of
God?</span></li>
<li><span>He hath no mercy on a man like himself, and doth he
entreat for his own sins?</span></li>
<li><span>He that is but flesh, nourisheth anger, and doth he ask
forgiveness of God? who shall obtain pardon for his
sins?</span></li>
<li><span>Remember thy last things, and let enmity
cease:</span></li>
<li><span>For corruption and death hang over in his
commandments.</span></li>
<li><span>Remember the fear of God, and be not angry with thy
neighbour.</span></li>
<li><span>Remember the covenant of the most High, and overlook the
ignorance of thy neighbour.</span></li>
<li><span>Refrain from strife, and thou shalt diminish thy
sine:</span></li>
<li><span>For a passionate man kindleth strife, and a sinful man
will trouble his friends, and bring in debate in the midst of them
that are at peace.</span></li>
<li><span>For as the wood of the forest is, so the fire burneth:
and as a man's strength is, so shall his anger be, and according to
his riches he shall increase his anger.</span></li>
<li><span>A hasty contention kindleth a fire: and a hasty quarrel
sheddeth blood: and a tongue that beareth witness bringeth
death.</span></li>
<li><span>If thou blow the spark, it shall burn as a fire: and if
thou spit upon it, it shall be quenched: both come out of the
mouth.</span></li>
<li><span>The whisperer and the double tongued is accursed: for he
hath troubled many that were at peace.</span></li>
<li><span>The tongue of a third person hath disquieted many, and
scattered them from nation to nation.</span></li>
<li><span>It hath destroyed the strong cities of the rich, and hath
overthrown the houses of great men.</span></li>
<li><span>It hath cut in pieces the forces of people, and undone
strong nations.</span></li>
<li><span>The tongue of a third person hath cast out valiant women,
and deprived them of their labours.</span></li>
<li><span>He that hearkeneth to it, shall never have rest, neither
shall he have a friend in whom he may repose.</span></li>
<li><span>The stroke of a whip maketh a blue mark: but the stroke
of the tongue will break the bones.</span></li>
<li><span>Many have fallen by the edge of the sword, but not so
many as have perished by their own tongue.</span></li>
<li><span>Blessed is he that is defended from a wicked tongue, that
hath not passed into the wrath thereof, and that hath not drawn the
yoke thereof, and hath not been bound in its bands.</span></li>
<li><span>For its yoke is a yoke of iron: and its bands are bands
of brass.</span></li>
<li><span>The death thereof is a most evil death: and hell is
preferable to it.</span></li>
<li><span>Its continuance shall not be for a long time, but it
shall possess the ways of the unjust: and the just shall not be
burnt with its flame.</span></li>
<li><span>They that forsake God shall fall into it, and it shall
burn in them, and shall not be quenched, and it shall be sent upon
them as a lion, and as a leopard it shall tear them.</span></li>
<li><span>Hedge in thy ears with thorns, hear not a wicked tongue,
and make doors and bars to thy mouth.</span></li>
<li><span>Melt down thy gold and silver, and make a balance for thy
words, and a just bridle for thy mouth:</span></li>
<li><span>And take heed lest thou slip with thy tongue, and fall in
the sight of thy enemies who lie in wait for thee, and thy fall be
incurable unto death.</span></li>

<li><span>He that sheweth mercy, lendeth to his neighbour: and he
that is stronger in hand, keepeth the commandments.</span></li>
<li><span>Lend to thy neighbour in the time of his need, and pay
thou thy neighbour again in due time.</span></li>
<li><span>Reap thy word, and deal faithfully with him: and thou
shalt always find that which is necessary for thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Many have looked upon a thing lent as a thing found, and
have given trouble to them that helped them.</span></li>
<li><span>Till they receive, they kiss the hands of the lender, and
in promises they humble their voice:</span></li>
<li><span>But when they should repay, they will ask time, and will
return tedious and murmuring words, and will complain of the
time:</span></li>
<li><span>And if he be able to pay, he will stand off, he will
scarce pay one half, and will count it as if he had found
it:</span></li>
<li><span>But if not, he will defraud him of his money, and he
shall get him for an enemy without cause:</span></li>
<li><span>And he will pay him with reproaches and curses, and
instead of honour and good turn will repay him
injuries.</span></li>
<li><span>Many have refused to lend, not out of wickedness, but
they were afraid to be defrauded without cause.</span></li>
<li><span>But yet towards the poor be thou more hearty, and delay
not to shew him mercy.</span></li>
<li><span>Help the poor because of the commandment: and send him
not away empty handed because of his poverty.</span></li>
<li><span>Lose thy money for thy brother and thy friend: and hide
it not under a stone to be lost.</span></li>
<li><span>Place thy treasure in the commandments of the most High,
and it shall bring thee more profit than gold.</span></li>
<li><span>Shut up alms in the heart of the poor, and it shall
obtain help for thee against all evil.</span></li>
<li><span>Better than the shield of the mighty, and better than the
spear:</span></li>
<li><span>It shall fight for thee against thy enemy.</span></li>
<li><span>A good man is surety for his neighbour: and he that hath
lost shame, will leave him to himself.</span></li>
<li><span>Forget not the kindness of thy surety: for he hath given
his life for thee.</span></li>
<li><span>The sinner and the unclean fleeth from his
surety.</span></li>
<li><span>A sinner attributeth to himself the goods of his surety:
and he that is of an unthankful mind will leave him that delivered
him.</span></li>
<li><span>A man is surety for his neighbour: and when he hath lost
all shame, he shall forsake him.</span></li>
<li><span>Evil suretyship hath undone many of good estate, and hath
tossed them as a wave of the sea.</span></li>
<li><span>It hath made powerful men to go from place to place round
about, and they have wandered in strange countries.</span></li>
<li><span>A sinner that transgresseth the commandment of the Lord,
shall fall into an evil suretyship: and he that undertaketh many
things, shall fall into judgment.</span></li>
<li><span>Recover thy neighbour according to thy power, and take
heed to thyself that thou fall not.</span></li>
<li><span>The chief thing for man's life is water and bread, and
clothing, and a house to cover shame.</span></li>
<li><span>Better is the poor man's fare under a roof of boards,
than sumptuous cheer abroad in another man's house.</span></li>
<li><span>Be contented with little instead of much, and thou shalt
not hear the reproach of going abroad.</span></li>
<li><span>It is a miserable life to go as a guest from house to
house: for where a man is a stranger, he shall not deal
confidently, nor open his mouth.</span></li>
<li><span>He shall entertain and feed, and give drink to the
unthankful, and moreover he shall hear bitter words.</span></li>
<li><span>Go, stranger, and furnish the table, and give others to
eat what thou hast in thy hand.</span></li>
<li><span>Give place to the honourable presence of my friends: for
I want my house, my brother being to be lodged with me.</span></li>
<li><span>These things are grievous to a man of understanding: the
upbraiding of houseroom, and the reproaching of the
lender.</span></li>

<li><span>He that loveth his son, frequently chastiseth him, that

<li><span>He that teacheth his son, maketh his enemy jealous, and

<li><span>While he lived he saw and rejoiced in him: and when he
died he was not sorrowful, neither was he confounded before his

<li><span>For he left behind him a defender of his house against

behaviour be an offence to thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Better is a poor man who is sound, and strong of
constitution, than a rich man who is weak and afflicted with
evils.</span></li>
<li><span>Health of the soul in holiness of justice, is better then
all gold and silver: and a sound body, than immense
revenues.</span></li>
<li><span>There is no riches above the riches of the health of the
body: and there is no pleasure above the joy of the
heart.</span></li>
<li><span>Better is death than a bitter life: and everlasting rest,
than continual sickness.</span></li>
<li><span>Good things that are hidden in a mouth that is shut, are
as masses of meat set about a grave.</span></li>
<li><span>What good shall an offering do to an idol? for it can
neither eat, nor smell:</span></li>
<li><span>So is he that is persecuted by the Lord, bearing the
reward of his iniquity:</span></li>
<li><span>He seeth with his eyes, and groaneth, as an eunuch
embracing a virgin, and sighing.</span></li>
<li><span>Give not up thy soul to sadness, and afflict not thyself
in thy own counsel.</span></li>
<li><span>The joyfulness of the heart, is the life of a man, and a
never failing treasure of holiness: and the joy of a man is length
of life.</span></li>
<li><span>Have pity on thy own soul, pleasing God, and contain
thyself: gather up thy heart in his holiness: and drive away
sadness far from thee.</span></li>
<li><span>For sadness hath killed many, and there is no profit in
it.</span></li>
<li><span>Envy and anger shorten a man's days, and pensiveness will
bring old age before the time.</span></li>

banquets are prepared with diligence.</span></li>

and in sleeping thou shalt not be uneasy with it, and thou shalt
feel no pain.</span></li>

man:</span></li>

wine?</span></li>
<li><span>What taketh away life? death.</span></li>
<li><span>Wine was created from the beginning to make men joyful,

<li><span>And he ordered the seasons, and holidays of them, and in

diversified their ways.</span></li>

<li><span>See that I have not laboured for myself only, but for all

<li><span>Hear me, ye great men, and all ye people, and hearken
with your ears, ye rulers of the church.</span></li>
<li><span>Give not to son or wife, brother or friend, power over
thee while thou livest; and give not thy estate to another, lest
then repent, and thou entreat for the same.</span></li>
<li><span>As long as thou livest, and hast breath in thee, let no
man change thee.</span></li>
<li><span>For it is better that thy children should ask of thee,
than that thou look toward the hands of thy children.</span></li>
<li><span>In all thy works keep the pre-eminence.</span></li>
<li><span>Let no stain sully thy glory. In the time when thou shalt

distribute thy inheritance.</span></li>
<li><span>Fodder, and a wand, and a burden are for an ass: bread,
and correction, and work for a slave.</span></li>
<li><span>He worketh under correction, and seeketh to rest: let his
hands be idle, and he seeketh liberty.</span></li>
<li><span>The yoke and the thong bend a stiff neck, and continual
labours bow a slave.</span></li>
<li><span>Torture and fetters are for a malicious slave: send him
to work, that he be not idle:</span></li>
<li><span>For idleness hath taught much evil.</span></li>
<li><span>Set him to work: for so it is fit for him. And if he be
not obedient, bring him down with fetters, but be not excessive
towards any one: and do no grievous thing without
judgment.</span></li>
<li><span>If thou have a faithful servant, let him be to thee as
thy own soul: treat him as a brother: because in the blood of thy
soul thou hast gotten him.</span></li>
<li><span>If thou hurt him unjustly, he will run away:</span></li>
<li><span>And if he rise up and depart, thou knowest not whom to
ask, and in what way to seek him.</span></li>

<li><span>The hopes of a man that is void of understanding are vain
and deceitful: and dreams lift up fools.</span></li>
<li><span>The man that giveth heed to lying visions, is like to him
that catcheth at a shadow, and followeth after the
wind.</span></li>
<li><span>The vision of dreams is the resemblance of one thing to
another: as when a man's likeness is before the face of a
man.</span></li>
<li><span>What can be made clean by the unclean? and what truth can
come from that which is false?</span></li>
<li><span>Deceitful divinations and lying omens and the dreams of
evildoers, are vanity:</span></li>
<li><span>And the heart fancieth as that of a woman in travail:
except it be a vision sent forth from the most High, set no thy
heart upon them.</span></li>
<li><span>For dreams have deceived many, and they have failed that
put their trust in them.</span></li>
<li><span>The word of the law shall be fulfilled without a lie, and
wisdom shall be made plain in the mouth of the
faithful.</span></li>
<li><span>What doth he know, that hath not been tried? A man that
hath much experience, shall think of many things: and he that hath
learned many things, shall shew forth understanding.</span></li>
<li><span>He that hath no experience, knoweth little: and he that
hath been experienced in many things, multiplieth
prudence.</span></li>
<li><span>He that hath not been tried, what manner of things doth
he know? he that hath been surprised, shall abound with
subtlety.</span></li>
<li><span>I have seen many things by travelling, and many customs
of things.</span></li>
<li><span>Sometimes I have been in danger of death for these
things, and I have been delivered by the grace of God.</span></li>
<li><span>The spirit of those that fear God; is sought after, and
by his regard shall be blessed.</span></li>
<li><span>For their hope is on him that saveth them, and the eyes
of God are upon them that love him.</span></li>
<li><span>He that feareth the Lord shall tremble at nothing, and
shall not be afraid for he is his hope.</span></li>
<li><span>The soul of him that feareth the Lord is
blessed.</span></li>
<li><span>To whom doth he look, and who in his
strength?</span></li>
<li><span>The eyes of the Lord are upon them that fear him, he is
their powerful protector, and strong stay, a defence from the heat,
and a cover from the sun at noon,</span></li>
<li><span>A preservation from stumbling, and a help from falling;
he raiseth up the soul, and enlighteneth the eyes, and giveth
health, and life, and blessing.</span></li>
<li><span>The offering of him that sacrificeth of a thing
wrongfully gotten, is stained, and the mockeries of the unjust are
not acceptable.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord is only for them that wait upon him in the way
of truth and justice.</span></li>
<li><span>The most High approveth not the gifts of the wicked:
neither hath he respect to the oblations of the unjust, nor will he
be pacified for sine by the multitude of their
sacrifices.</span></li>
<li><span>He that offereth sacrifice of the goods of the poor, is
as one that sacrificeth the son in the presence of his
father.</span></li>
<li><span>The bread of the needy, is the life of the poor: he that
defraudeth them thereof, is a man of blood.</span></li>
<li><span>He that taketh away the bread gotten by sweat, is like
him that killeth his neighbour.</span></li>
<li><span>He that sheddeth blood, and he that defraudeth the
labourer of his hire, are brothers.</span></li>
<li><span>When one buildeth up, and another pulleth down: what
profit have they but the labour?</span></li>
<li><span>When one prayeth, and another curseth: whose voice will
God hear?</span></li>
<li><span>He that washeth himself after touching the dead, if he
toucheth him again, what doth his washing avail?</span></li>
<li><span>So a man that fasteth for his sins, and doth the same
again, what doth his humbling himself profit him? who will hear his
prayer?</span></li>

<li><span>He that keepeth the law, multiplieth
offerings.</span></li>
<li><span>It is a wholesome sacrifice to take heed to the
commandments, and to depart from all iniquity. _J</span></li>
<li><span>And to depart from injustice, is to offer a propitiatory
sacrifice for injustices, and a begging of pardon for
sins.</span></li>
<li><span>He shall return thanks, that offereth fine flour: and he
that doth mercy, offereth sacrifice.</span></li>
<li><span>To depart from iniquity is that which pleaseth the Lord,
and to depart from injustice, is an entreaty for sins.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt not appear empty in the sight of the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>For all these things are to be done because of the
commandment of God.</span></li>
<li><span>The oblation of the just maketh the altar fat, and is an
odour of sweetness in the sight of the most High.</span></li>
<li><span>The sacrifice of the just is acceptable, and the Lord
will not forget the memorial thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>Give glory to God with a good heart: and diminish not the
firstfruits of thy hands.</span></li>
<li><span>In every gift shew a cheerful countenance, and sanctify
thy tithes with joy.</span></li>
<li><span>Give to the most High according to what he hath given to
thee, and with a good eye do according to the ability of thy
hands:</span></li>
<li><span>For the Lord maketh recompense, and will give thee seven
times as much.</span></li>
<li><span>Do not offer wicked gifts, for such he will not
receive.</span></li>
<li><span>And look not upon an unjust sacrifice, for the Lord is
judge, and there is not with him respect of person.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord will not accept any person against a poor man,
and he will hear the prayer of him that is wronged.</span></li>
<li><span>He will not despise the prayers of the fatherless; nor
the widow, when she poureth out her complaint.</span></li>
<li><span>Do not the widow's tears run down the cheek, and her cry
against him that causeth them to fall?</span></li>
<li><span>For from the cheek they go up even to heaven, and the
Lord that heareth will not be delighted with them.</span></li>
<li><span>He that adoreth God with joy, shall be accepted, and his
prayer shall approach even to the clouds.</span></li>
<li><span>The prayer of him that humbleth himself, shall pierce the
clouds: and till it come nigh he will not be comforted: and he will
not depart till the most High behold.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord will not be slack, but will judge for the
just, and will do judgment: and the Almighty will not have patience
with them, that he may crush their back:</span></li>
<li><span>And he will repay vengeance to the Gentiles, till he have
taken away the multitude of the proud, and broken the sceptres of
the unjust,</span></li>
<li><span>Till he have rendered to men according to their deeds:
and according to the works of Adam, and according to his
presumption,</span></li>
<li><span>Till he have judged the cause of his people, and he shall
delight the just with his mercy.</span></li>
<li><span>The mercy of God is beautiful in the time of affliction,
as a cloud of rain in the time of drought.</span></li>

<li><span>Every friend will say: I also am his friend: but there is

to death?</span></li>
<li><span>But a companion and a friend shall be turned to an

<li><span>O wicked presumption, whence camest thou to cover the
earth with thy malice, and deceitfulness?</span></li>
<li><span>There is a companion who rejoiceth with his friend in his
joys, but in the time of trouble, he will be against
him.</span></li>
<li><span>There is a companion who condoleth with his friend for

<li><span>Forget not thy friend in thy mind, and be not unmindful
of him in thy riches.</span></li>
<li><span>Consult not with him that layeth a snare for thee, and
hide thy counsel from them that envy thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Every counsellor giveth out counsel, but there is one

<li><span>Beware of a counsellor. And know before what need he
hath: for he will devise to his own mind:</span></li>
<li><span>Lest he thrust a stake into the ground, and say to
thee:</span></li>
<li><span>Thy way is good; and then stand on the other side to see
what shall befall thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Treat not with a man without religion concerning
holiness, nor with an unjust man concerning justice, nor with a

concerning war, nor with a merchant about traffic, nor with a buyer
of selling, nor with an envious man of giving thanks,</span></li>
<li><span>Nor with the ungodly of piety, nor with the dishonest of
honesty, nor with the held labourer of every work</span></li>
<li><span>Nor with him that worketh by the year of the finishing of

<li><span>Whose soul is according to thy own soul: and who, when
thou shalt stumble in the dark, will be sorry for thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And establish within thyself a heart of good counsel: for
there is no other thing of more worth to thee than it.</span></li>
<li><span>The soul of a holy man discovereth sometimes true things,
more than seven watchmen that sit in a high piece to
watch.</span></li>
<li><span>But above all these things pray to the most High, that he
may direct thy way in truth.</span></li>
<li><span>In all thy works let the true word go before thee, and
steady counsel before every action.</span></li>
<li><span>A wicked word shall change the beast: out of which four
manner of things arise, good and evil, life and death: and the
tongue is continually the ruler of them. There is a man that is
subtle and a teacher of many, and yet is unprofitable to his own

<li><span>He that speaketh sophistically, is hateful: he shall be
destitute of every thing.</span></li>

<li><span>A wise man instructeth his own people, and the fruits of
his understanding are faithful.</span></li>
<li><span>A wise man shall be filled with blessings, and they that
see shall praise him.</span></li>
<li><span>The life of a man is in the number of his days: but the
days of Israel are innumerable.</span></li>
<li><span>A wise man shall inherit honour among his people, and his
name shall live for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>My son, prove thy soul in thy life: and if it be wicked,
give it no power:</span></li>
<li><span>For all things are not expedient for all, and every kind
pleaseth not every soul.</span></li>
<li><span>Be not greedy in any feasting, and pour not out thyself
upon any meat:</span></li>
<li><span>For in many meats there will be sickness, and greediness
will turn to choler.</span></li>
<li><span>By surfeiting many have perished: but he that is

<li><span>He that sinneth in the sight of his Maker, shall fall

<li><span>My son, shed tears over the dead, and begin to lament as

cover his body, and neglect not his burial.</span></li>

day, and then comfort thyself in thy sadness.</span></li>

day, or two, for fear of detraction.</span></li>

strength, and the sorrow of the heart boweth down the
neck.</span></li>
<li><span>In withdrawing aside sorrow remaineth: and the substance
of the poor is according to his heart.</span></li>
<li><span>Give not up thy heart to sadness, but drive it from thee:
and remember the latter end.</span></li>
<li><span>Forget it not: for there is no returning, and thou shalt
do him no good, and shalt hurt thyself.</span></li>
<li><span>Remember my judgment: for also shall be so: yesterday for
me, and to day for thee.</span></li>
<li><span>When the dead is at rest, let his remembrance rest, and
comfort him in the departing of his spirit.</span></li>
<li><span>The wisdom of a scribe cometh by his time of leisure: and
he that is less in action, shall receive wisdom.</span></li>
<li><span>With what wisdom shall he be furnished that holdeth the
plough, and that glorieth in the goad, that driveth the oxen
therewith, and is occupied in their labours, and his whole talk is
about the offspring of bulls?</span></li>
<li><span>He shall give his mind to turn up furrows, and his care
is to give the kine fodder.</span></li>
<li><span>So every craftsman and workmaster that laboureth night
and day, he who maketh graven seals, and by his continual diligence
varieth the figure: he shall give his mind to the resemblance of
the picture, and by his watching shall finish the work.</span></li>
<li><span>So doth the smith sitting by the anvil and considering
the iron work. The vapour of the fire wasteth his flesh, and he
fighteth with the heat of the furnace.</span></li>
<li><span>The noise of the hammer is always in his ears, and his
eye is upon the pat tern of the vessel he maketh.</span></li>
<li><span>He setteth his mind to finish his work, and his watching
to polish them, to perfection.</span></li>
<li><span>So doth the potter sitting at his work, turning the wheel
about with his feet, who is always carefully set to his work, and
maketh all his work by number:</span></li>
<li><span>He fashioneth the clay with his arm, and boweth down his
strength before his feet:</span></li>

watching to make clean the furnace.</span></li>
<li><span>All these trust to their hands, and every one is wise in
his own art.</span></li>
<li><span>Without these a city is not built.</span></li>

<li><span>In the time of destruction they shall pour out their

<li><span>And in the time of rest upon his bed, the sleep of the
night changeth his knowledge.</span></li>
<li><span>A little and as nothing is his rest, and afterward in
sleep, as in the day of keeping watch.</span></li>
<li><span>He is troubled in the vision of his heart, as if he had
escaped in the day of battle. In the time of his safety he rose up,
and wondereth that there is no fear:</span></li>
<li><span>Such things happen to all flesh, from man even to beast,
and upon sinners are sevenfold mere.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover, death, and bloodshed, strife, and sword,
oppressions, famine, and affliction, and scourges:</span></li>
<li><span>All these things are created for the wicked, and for
their sakes came the flood.</span></li>
<li><span>All things that are of the earth, shall return to the
earth again, and all waters shall return to the sea.</span></li>
<li><span>All bribery, and injustice shall blotted out, and
fidelity shall stand for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>The riches of the unjust shall be dried up like a river,
and shall pass sway a noise like a great thunder in
rain.</span></li>
<li><span>While he openeth his hands he shall rejoice: but
transgressors shall pine away in the end.</span></li>
<li><span>The offspring of the ungodly shall not bring forth many
branches, and make a noise as unclean roots upon the top of a
rock.</span></li>
<li><span>The weed growing over every water, and at the bank of the
river, shall be pulled up before all grass.</span></li>
<li><span>Grace is like a paradise in blessings, and mercy
remaineth for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>The life of a labourer that is content with what he hath,
shall be sweet, and in it thou shalt find a treasure.</span></li>
<li><span>Children, and the building of a city shall establish a
name, but a blameless wife shall be counted above them
both.</span></li>
<li><span>Wine and music rejoice the heart, but the love of wisdom
is above them both.</span></li>
<li><span>The flute and the psaltery make a sweet melody, but a
pleasant tongue is above them both.</span></li>
<li><span>Thy eye desireth favour and beauty, but more than these
green sown fields.</span></li>
<li><span>A friend and companion meeting together in season, but
above them both is a wife with her husband.</span></li>
<li><span>Brethren are a help in the time of trouble, but mercy
shall deliver more than they.</span></li>
<li><span>Gold and silver make the feet stand sure: but wise
counsel is above them both.</span></li>
<li><span>Riches and strength lift up the heart: but above these is
the fear of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>There is no want in the fear of the Lord, and it needeth
not to seek for help.</span></li>
<li><span>The fear of the Lord is like a paradise of blessing, and
they have covered it above all glory.</span></li>
<li><span>My son, in thy lifetime be not indigent: for it is better
to die than to want.</span></li>
<li><span>The life of him that looketh toward another man's table
is not to be counted a life: for he feedeth his soul with another
man's meat.</span></li>
<li><span>But a man, well instructed and taught, will look to
himself.</span></li>
<li><span>Begging will be sweet in the mouth of the unwise, but in
his belly there shall burn a fire.</span></li>

before a congregation and a people:</span></li>
<li><span>Of injustice before a companion and friend: and in regard

leaning with thy elbow over meat, and of deceit in giving and

<li><span>Gaze not upon another man's wife, and be not inquisitive

<li><span>Repeat not the word which thou hast heard, and disclose
not the thing that is secret; so shalt thou be truly without
confusion, and shah find favour before all men: be not ashamed of
any of these things, and accept no person to sin
thereby:</span></li>
<li><span>Of the law of the most High, and of his covenant, and of
judgment to justify the ungodly:</span></li>
<li><span>Of the affair of companions and travellers, and of the
gift of the inheritance of friends:</span></li>
<li><span>Of exactness of balance and weights, of getting much or
little:</span></li>
<li><span>Of the corruption of buying, and of merchants, and of
much correction of children, and to make the side of a wicked slave
to bleed.</span></li>
<li><span>Sure keeping is good over a wicked wife.</span></li>
<li><span>Where there are many hands, shut up, and deliver all
things in number, and weight: and put all in writing that thou
givest out or receivest in.</span></li>
<li><span>Be not ashamed to inform the unwise and foolish, and the
aged, that are judged I by young men: and thou shalt be well
instructed in all things, and well approved in the sight of all men
living.</span></li>
<li><span>The father waketh for the daughter when no man knoweth,

<li><span>In her virginity, lest she should be corrupted, and be
found with child in her father's house: and having a husband, lest
she should misbehave herself, or at the least become
barren.</span></li>
<li><span>Keep a sure watch over a shameless daughter: lest at any
time she make thee become a laughingstock to thy enemies, and a
byword in the city, and a reproach among the people, and she make
thee ashamed before all the multitude.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold not everybody's beauty: and tarry not among
women.</span></li>
<li><span>For from garments cometh a moth, end from a woman the
iniquity of a man.</span></li>
<li><span>For better is the iniquity of a man, than a woman doing a
good turn, and a woman bringing shame and reproach.</span></li>
<li><span>I will now remember the works of the Lord, and I will

<li><span>He hath searched out the deep, and the heart of men: and

<li><span>By his commandment he maketh the snow to fall apace, and

<li><span>Through this are the treasures opened, and the clouds fly
out like birds.</span></li>
<li><span>By his greatness he hath fixed the clouds, and the

<li><span>At his sight shall the mountains be shaken, and at his

<li><span>The noise of his thunder shall strike the earth, so doth

<li><span>He shall pour frost as salt upon the earth: and when it
freezeth, it shall become like the tops of thistles.</span></li>
<li><span>The cold north wind bloweth, and the water is congealed
into crystal; upon every gathering together of waters it shall
rest, and shall clothe the waters as a breastplate.</span></li>

not weary: for you can never go far enough.</span></li>
<li><span>Who shall see him, and declare him? and who shall magnify
him as he is from the beginning?</span></li>
<li><span>There are many things hidden from us that are greater

<li><span>Let us now praise men of renown, and our fathers in their
generation.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord hath wrought great glory through his
magnificence from the beginning.</span></li>
<li><span>Such as have borne rule in their dominions, men of great
power, and endued with their wisdom, shewing forth in the prophets
the dignity of prophets,</span></li>
<li><span>And ruling over the present people, and by the strength
of wisdom instructing the people in most holy words.</span></li>
<li><span>Such as by their skill sought out musical tunes, and
published canticles of the scriptures.</span></li>
<li><span>Rich men in virtue, studying beautifulness: living at
peace in their houses.</span></li>
<li><span>All these have gained glory in their generations, and
were praised in their days.</span></li>
<li><span>They that were born of them have left a name behind them,
that their praises might be related:</span></li>
<li><span>And there are some, of whom there is no memorial: who are
perished, as if they had never been: and are become as if they had
never been born, and their children with them.</span></li>
<li><span>But these were men of mercy, whose godly deeds have not
failed:</span></li>
<li><span>Good things continue with their seed,</span></li>
<li><span>Their posterity are a holy inheritance, and their seed
hath stood in the covenants.</span></li>
<li><span>And their children for their sakes remain for ever: their
seed and their glory shall not be forsaken.</span></li>
<li><span>Their bodies are buried in peace, and their name liveth
unto generation and generation.</span></li>
<li><span>Let the people shew forth their wisdom, and the church
declare their praise.</span></li>
<li><span>Henoch pleased God, and was translated into paradise,
that he may give repentance to the nations.</span></li>
<li><span>Noe was found perfect, just, and in the time of wrath he

<li><span>Therefore was there a remnant left to the earth, when the
flood came.</span></li>

flesh should no more be destroyed with the hood.</span></li>
<li><span>Abraham was the great father of a multitude of nations,
and there was not found the like to him in glory, who kept the law
of the most High, and was in covenant with him.</span></li>
<li><span>In his flesh he established the covenant, and in
temptation he was found faithful.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore by an oath he gave him glory in his posterity,
that he should increase as the dust of the earth,</span></li>
<li><span>And that he would exalt his seed as the stars, and they
should inherit from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of
the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And he did in like manner with Isaac for the sake of
Abraham his father.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord gave him the blessing of all nations, and
confirmed his covenant upon the head of Jacob.</span></li>
<li><span>He acknowledged him in his blessings, and gave him an
inheritance, and divided him his portion in twelve
tribes.</span></li>

in the fear of his enemies, and with his words he made prodigies to
cease.</span></li>
<li><span>He glorified him in the sight of kings, and gave him
commandments in the sight of his people, and shewed him his

<li><span>He sanctified him in his faith, and meekness, and chose
him out of all flesh.</span></li>
<li><span>For he heard him, and his voice, and brought him into a
cloud.</span></li>
<li><span>And he gave him commandments before his face, and a law
of life and instruction, that he might teach Jacob his covenant,
and Israel his judgments.</span></li>
<li><span>He exalted Aaron his brother, and like to himself of the
tribe of Levi:</span></li>
<li><span>He made an everlasting covenant with him, and gave him
the priesthood of the nation, and made him blessed in
glory,</span></li>
<li><span>And he girded him about with a glorious girdle, and
clothed him with a robe of glory, and crowned him with majestic
attire.</span></li>
<li><span>He put upon him a garment to the feet, and breeches, and
as ephod, and he compassed him with many little bells of gold all
round about,</span></li>
<li><span>That as he went there might be a sound, and a noise made
that might be heard in the temple, for a memorial to the children
of his people.</span></li>
<li><span>He gave him a holy robe of gold, and blue, and purple, a
woven work of a wise man, endued with judgment and
truth:</span></li>
<li><span>Of twisted scarlet the work of an artist, with precious
stones cut and set in gold, and graven by the work of a lapidary
for a memorial, according to the number of the tribes of
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And a crown of gold upon his mitre wherein was engraved
Holiness, an ornament of honour: a work of power, and delightful to
the eyes for its beauty.</span></li>
<li><span>Before him there were none so beautiful, even from the
beginning.</span></li>
<li><span>No stranger was ever clothed with them, but only his
children alone, and his grandchildren for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>His sacrifices were consumed with fire every
day.</span></li>
<li><span>Moses filled his hands and anointed him with holy
oil.</span></li>
<li><span>This was made to him for an everlasting testament, and to
his seed as the days of heaven, to execute the office of the
priesthood, and to have praise, and to glorify his people in his
name.</span></li>
<li><span>He chose him out of all men living, to offer sacrifice to
God, incense, and a good savour, for a memorial to make
reconciliation for his people:</span></li>
<li><span>And he gave him power in his commandments, in the
covenants of his judgments, that he should teach Jacob his
testimonies, and give light to Israel in his law.</span></li>
<li><span>And strangers stood up against him, and through envy the
men that were with Dathan and Abiron, compassed him about in the
wilderness, and the congregation of Core in their
wrath.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord God saw and it pleased him not, and they were
consumed in his wrathful indignation.</span></li>
<li><span>He wrought wonders upon them, and consumed them with a
flame of fire.</span></li>
<li><span>And he added glory to Aaron, and gave him an inheritance,
and divided unto him the firstfruits of the increase of the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>He prepared them bread in the first place unto fulness:
for the sacrifices also of the Lord they shall eat, which he gave

<li><span>But he shall not inherit among the people in the land,
and he hath no portion among the people: for he himself is his
portion and inheritance.</span></li>
<li><span>Phinees the son of Eleazar is the third in glory, by
imitating him in the fear of the Lord:</span></li>
<li><span>And he stood up in the shameful fall of the people: in

Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore he made to him a covenant of peace, to be the
prince of the sanctuary, and of his people, that the dignity of
priesthood should be to him and to his seed for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>And a covenant to David the king, the son of Jesse of the
tribe of Juda, an inheritance to him and to his seed, that he might
give wisdom into our heart to judge his people in justice, that
their good things might not be abolished, and he made their glory

<li><span>How great glory did he gain when he lifted up his hands,

<li><span>Who before him hath so resisted? for the Lord himself
brought the enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>Was not the sun stopped in his anger, and one day made as

<li><span>He called upon the most high Sovereign when the enemies
assaulted him on every side, and the great and holy God heard him
by hailstones of exceeding great force.</span></li>
<li><span>He made a violent assault against the nation of his

adversaries.</span></li>
<li><span>That the nations might know his power, that it is not

strength continued even to his old age, so that he went up to the
high places of the land, and his seed obtained it for an

good to obey the holy God.</span></li>

saw the God of light:</span></li>
<li><span>And called upon the name of the Lord Almighty, in
fighting against the enemies who beset him on every side, when he
offered a lamb without blemish.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord thundered from heaven, and with a great
noise made his voice to be heard.</span></li>
<li><span>And he crushed the princes of the Tyrians, and all the
lords of the Philistines:</span></li>

he protested before the Lord, and his anointed: money, or any thing
else, even to a shoe, he had not taken of any man, and no mall did
accuse him.</span></li>

enemies under him, that he might build a house in his name, and
prepare a sanctuary for ever: O how wise wast thou in thy
youth!</span></li>
<li><span>And thou wast filled as a river with wisdom, and thy soul
covered the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou didst multiply riddles in parables: thy name
went abroad to the islands far off, and thou wast beloved in thy
peace.</span></li>
<li><span>The countries wondered at thee for thy canticles, and
proverbs, and parables, and interpretations,</span></li>
<li><span>And at the name of the Lord God, whose surname is, God of
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou didst gather gold as copper, and didst multiply
silver as lead,</span></li>
<li><span>And thou didst bow thyself to women: and by thy body thou
wast brought under subjection.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast stained thy glory, and defiled thy seed so as
to bring wrath upon thy children, and to have thy folly
kindled,</span></li>
<li><span>That thou shouldst make the kingdom to be divided, and
out of Ephraim a rebellious kingdom to rule.</span></li>
<li><span>But God will not leave off his mercy, and he will not
destroy, nor abolish his own works, neither will he out up by the
roots the offspring of his elect: and he will not utterly take away
the seed of him that loveth the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore he gave a remnant to Jacob, and to David of the
same stock.</span></li>
<li><span>And Solomon had an end with his fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>And he left behind him of his seed, the folly of the
nation,</span></li>
<li><span>Even Roboam that had little wisdom, who turned away the
people through his counsel:</span></li>
<li><span>And Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who caused Israel to sin,
and shewed Ephraim the way of sin, and their sins were multiplied
exceedingly.</span></li>
<li><span>They removed them far away from their land.</span></li>
<li><span>And they sought out all iniquities, till vengeance came
upon them, and put an end to all their sine.</span></li>

<li><span>And Elias the prophet stood up, as a fire, and his word
burnt like a torch.</span></li>
<li><span>He brought a famine upon them, and they that provoked him
in their envy, were reduced to a small number, for they could not
endure the commandments of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>By the word of the Lord he shut up the heaven, and he
brought down fire from heaven thrice.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus was Elias magnified in his wondrous works. And who
can glory like to thee?</span></li>
<li><span>Who raisedst up a dead man from below, from the lot of
death, by the word of the Lord God.</span></li>
<li><span>Who broughtest down kings to destruction, and brokest
easily their power in pieces, and the glorious from their
bed.</span></li>
<li><span>Who heardest judgment in Sina, and in Horeb the judgments
of vengeance.</span></li>
<li><span>Who anointedst kings to penance, and madest prophets
successors after thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Who wast taken up in a whirlwind of fire, in a chariot of
fiery horses.</span></li>
<li><span>Who art registered in the judgments of times to appease
the wrath of the Lord, to reconcile the heart of the father to the
son, and to restore the tribes of Jacob.</span></li>
<li><span>Blessed are they that saw thee, and were honoured with
thy friendship.</span></li>
<li><span>For we live only in our life, but after death our name
shall not be such.</span></li>
<li><span>Elias was indeed covered with the whirlwind, and his
spirit was filled up in Eliseus: in his days he feared not the
prince, and no man was more powerful than he.</span></li>
<li><span>No word could overcome him, and after death his body
prophesied.</span></li>
<li><span>In his life he did great wonders, and is death he wrought
miracles.</span></li>
<li><span>For all this the people repented not, neither did they
depart from their sins till they were cast out of their land, and
were scattered through all the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And there was left but a small people, and a prince in
the house of David.</span></li>
<li><span>Some of these did that which pleased God: but others
committed many sine.</span></li>
<li><span>Ezechias fortified his city, and brought in water into
the midst thereof, and he digged a rock with iron, and made a well
for water.</span></li>
<li><span>In his days Sennacherib came up, and sent Rabsaces, and
lifted up his hand against them, and he stretched out his hand
against Sion, and became proud through his power.</span></li>
<li><span>Then their hearts and hands trembled, and they were in
pain as women in travail.</span></li>
<li><span>And they called upon the Lord who is merciful, and
spreading their hands, they lifted them up to heaven: and the holy
Lord God quickly heard their voice.</span></li>
<li><span>He was not mindful of their sins, neither did he deliver
them up to their enemies, but he purified them by the hand of
Isaias, the holy prophet.</span></li>
<li><span>He overthrew the army of the Assyrians, and the angel of
the Lord destroyed them.</span></li>
<li><span>For Ezechias did that which pleased God, and walked
valiantly in the way of David his father, which Isaias, the great
prophet, and faithful in the sight of God, had commanded
him.</span></li>
<li><span>In his days the sun went backward, and he lengthened the
king's life.</span></li>
<li><span>With a great spirit he saw the things that are to come to
pass at last, and comforted the mourners in Sion.</span></li>
<li><span>He shewed what should come to pass for ever, and secret
things before they came.</span></li>

<li><span>The memory of Josias is like the composition of a sweet
smell made by the art of a perfumer:</span></li>
<li><span>His remembrance shall be sweet as honey in every mouth,
and as music at a banquet of wine.</span></li>
<li><span>He was directed by God unto the repentance of the nation,
and he took away the abominations of wickedness.</span></li>
<li><span>And he directed his heart towards the Lord, and in the
days of sinners he strengthened godliness.</span></li>
<li><span>Except David, and Ezechias, and Josias, all committed
sin.</span></li>
<li><span>For the kings of Juda forsook the law of the most High,
and despised the fear of God.</span></li>
<li><span>So they gave their kingdom to others, and their glory to
a strange nation.</span></li>
<li><span>They burnt the chosen city of holiness, and made the
streets thereof desolate according to the prediction of
Jeremias.</span></li>
<li><span>For they treated him evil, who was consecrated a prophet
from his mother's womb, to overthrow, and pluck up, and destroy,
and to build again, and renew.</span></li>
<li><span>It was Ezechiel that saw the glorious vision, which was
shewn him upon the chariot of cherubims.</span></li>
<li><span>For he made mention of the enemies under the figure of
rain, and of doing good to them that shewed right ways.</span></li>
<li><span>And may the bones of the twelve prophets spring up out of
their place: for they strengthened Jacob, and re- deemed themselves
by strong faith.</span></li>
<li><span>How shall we magnify Zorobabel? for he was as a signet on
the right hand;</span></li>
<li><span>In like manner Jesus the son of Josedec? who in their
days built the house, and set up a holy temple to the Lord,
prepared for everlasting glory.</span></li>
<li><span>And let Nehemias be a long time remembered, who raised up
for us our walls that were cast down, and set up the gates and the
bars, who rebuilt our houses.</span></li>
<li><span>No man was born upon earth like Henoch: for he also was
taken up from the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>Nor as Joseph, who was a man born prince of his brethren,
the support of his family, the ruler of his brethren, the stay of
the people:</span></li>
<li><span>And his bones were visited, and after death they
prophesied.</span></li>
<li><span>Seth and Sem obtained glory among men: and above every
soul Adam in the beginning. R</span></li>

<li><span>Simon the high priest, the son of Onias, who in his life
propped up the house, and in his days fortified the
temple.</span></li>
<li><span>By him also the height of the temple was founded, the
double building and the high walls of the temple.</span></li>
<li><span>In his days the wells of water flowed out, and they were
filled as the sea above measure.</span></li>
<li><span>He took care of his nation, and delivered it from
destruction.</span></li>
<li><span>He prevailed to enlarge the city, and obtained glory in
his conversation with the people: and enlarged the entrance of the
house and the court.</span></li>
<li><span>He shone in his days as the morning star in the midst of
a cloud, and as the moon at the full.</span></li>
<li><span>And as the sun when it shineth, so did he shine in the
temple of God.</span></li>
<li><span>And as the rainbow giving light in the bright clouds, and
as the flower of roses in the days of the spring, and as the lilies
that are on the brink of the water, and as the sweet smelling
frankincense in the time of summer.</span></li>
<li><span>As a bright Are, and frankincense burning in the
fire.</span></li>
<li><span>As a massy vessel of gold, adorned with every precious
stone.</span></li>
<li><span>As an olive tree budding forth, and a cypress tree
rearing itself on high, when he put on the robe of glory, and was
clothed with the perfection of power.</span></li>
<li><span>When he went up to the holy altar, he honoured the
vesture of holiness.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he took the portions out of the hands of the
priests, he himself stood by the altar. And about him was the ring
of his brethren: and as the cedar planted in mount
Libanus,</span></li>
<li><span>And as branches of palm trees, they stood round about
him, and all the sons of Aaron in their glory.</span></li>
<li><span>And the oblation of the Lord was in their hands, before
all the congregation of Israel: and finishing his service, on the
altar, to honour the offering of the most high Ring,</span></li>
<li><span>He stretched forth his hand to make a libation, and
offered of the blood of the grape.</span></li>
<li><span>He poured out at the foot of the altar a divine odour to
the most high Prince.</span></li>
<li><span>Then the sons of Aaron shouted, they sounded with beaten
trumpets, and made a great noise to be heard for a remembrance
before God.</span></li>
<li><span>Then all the people together made haste, and fell down to
the earth upon their faces, to adore the Lord their God, and to
pray to the Almighty God the most High.</span></li>
<li><span>And the singers lifted up their voices. and in the great
house the sound of sweet melody was increased.</span></li>
<li><span>And the people in prayer besought the Lord the most High,
until the worship of the Lord was perfected, and they had finished
their office.</span></li>
<li><span>Then coming down, he lifted up his hands over all the
congregation of the children of Israel, to give glory to God with
his lips, and to glory in his name:</span></li>
<li><span>And he repeated his prayer, willing to shew the power of
God.</span></li>
<li><span>And now pray ye to the God of all, who hath done great
things in all the earth, who hath increased our days from our
mother's womb, and hath done with us according to his
mercy.</span></li>
<li><span>May he grant us joyfulness of heart, and that there be
peace in our days in Israel for ever:</span></li>
<li><span>That Israel may believe that the mercy of God is with us,
to deliver us in his days.</span></li>
<li><span>There are two nations which my soul abhorreth: and the
third is no nation, which I hate:</span></li>
<li><span>They that sit on mount Seir, and the Philistines, and the
foolish people that dwell in Sichem.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus the son of Sirach, of Jerusalem, hath written in
this book the doctrine of wisdom and instruction, who renewed
wisdom from his heart.</span></li>
<li><span>Blessed is he that is conversant in these good things:
and he that layeth them up in his heart, shall be wise
always.</span></li>
<li><span>For if he do them, he shall be strong to do all things:
because the light of God guideth his steps.</span></li>

<li><span>A prayer of Jesus the son of Sirach. I will give glory to
thee, O Lord, O King, and I will praise thee, O God my
Saviour.</span></li>
<li><span>I will give glory to thy name: for thou best been a
helper and protector to me.</span></li>
<li><span>And hast preserved my body from destruction, from the
snare of an unjust tongue, and from the lips of them that forge
lies, and in the sight of them that stood by, thou hast been my
helper.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou hast delivered me, according to the multitude of
the mercy of thy name, from them that did roar, prepared to
devour.</span></li>
<li><span>Out of the hands of them that sought my life, and from
the gates of afflictions, which compassed me about:</span></li>
<li><span>From the oppression of the flame which surrounded me, and
in the midst of the fire I was not burnt.</span></li>
<li><span>From the depth of the belly of hell, and from an unclean
tongue, and from lying words, from an unjust king, and from a
slanderous tongue:</span></li>
<li><span>My soul shall praise the Lord even to death.</span></li>
<li><span>And my life was drawing near to hell beneath.</span></li>
<li><span>They compassed me on every side, and there was no one
that would help me. I looked for the succour of men, and there was
none.</span></li>
<li><span>I remembered thy mercy, O Lord, and thy works, which are
from the beginning of the world.</span></li>
<li><span>How thou deliverest them that wait for thee, O Lord, and
savest them out of the hands of the nations.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast exalted my dwelling place upon the earth and I
have prayed for death to pass away.</span></li>
<li><span>I called upon the Lord, the father of my Lord, that he
would not leave me in the day of my trouble, and in the time of the
proud without help.</span></li>
<li><span>I will praise thy name continually, and will praise it
with thanksgiving, and my prayer was heard.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou hast saved me from destruction, and hast
delivered me from the evil time.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore I will give thanks, and praise thee, and bless
the name of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>When I was yet young, before I wandered about, I sought
for wisdom openly in my prayer.</span></li>
<li><span>I prayed for her before the temple, and unto the very end
I will seek after her, and she flourished as a grape soon
ripe.</span></li>
<li><span>My heart delighted in her, my foot walked in the right
way, from my youth up I sought after her.</span></li>
<li><span>I bowed down my ear a little, and received
her.</span></li>
<li><span>I found much wisdom in myself, and I profited much
therein.</span></li>
<li><span>To him that giveth me wisdom, will I give
glory.</span></li>
<li><span>For I have determined to follow her: I have had a zeal
for good, and shall not be confounded.</span></li>
<li><span>My soul hath wrestled for her, and in doing it I have
been confirmed.</span></li>
<li><span>I stretched forth my hands on high, and I bewailed my
ignorance of her.</span></li>
<li><span>I directed my soul to her, and in knowledge I found
her.</span></li>
<li><span>I possessed my heart with her from the beginning:
therefore I shall not be forsaken.</span></li>
<li><span>My entrails were troubled in seeking her: therefore shall
I possess a good possession.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord hath given me a tongue for my reward: and with
it I will praise him.</span></li>
<li><span>Draw near to me, ye unlearned, and gather yourselves
together into the house of discipline.</span></li>
<li><span>Why are ye slow? and what do you say of these things?
your souls are exceeding thirsty.</span></li>
<li><span>I have opened my mouth, and have spoken: buy her for
yourselves without silver,</span></li>
<li><span>And submit your neck to the yoke, and let your soul
receive discipline: for she is near at hand to be
found.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold with your eyes how I have laboured a little, and
have found much rest to myself.</span></li>
<li><span>Receive ye discipline as a great sum of money, and
possess abundance of gold by her.</span></li>
<li><span>Let your soul rejoice in his mercy, and you shall not be
confounded in his praise.</span></li>
<li><span>Work your work before the time, and he will give you your
reward in his time.</span></li>
