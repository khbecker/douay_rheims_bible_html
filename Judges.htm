  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="1">Judges 1</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>After the death of Josue the children of Israel
    consulted the Lord, saying: Who shall go up before us against
    the Chanaanite, and shall be the leader of the war?</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said: Juda shall go up: behold I have
    delivered the land into his hands.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Juda said to Simeon his brother: Come up with me
    into my lot, and fight against the Chanaanite, that I also may
    go along with thee into thy lot. And Simeon went with
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Juda went up, and the Lord delivered the
    Chanaanite, and the Pherezite into their hands: and they slew
    of them in Bezec ten thousand men.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they found Adonibezec in Bezec, and fought
    against him, and they defeated the Chanaanite, and the
    Pherezite.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Adonibezec fled: and they pursued after him and
    took him, and cut off his fingers and toes.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Adonibezec said: Seventy kings having their
    fingers and toes cut off, gathered up the leavings of the meat
    under my table: as I have done, so hath God requited me. And
    they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the children of Juda besieging Jerusalem, took
    it, and put it to the sword, and set the whole city on
    fire.</span></li>

    <li><span>And afterwards they went down and fought against the
    Chanaanite, who dwelt in the mountains, and in the south, and
    in the plains.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Juda going forward against the Chanaanite, that
    dwelt in Hebron (the name whereof was in former times
    Cariath-Arbe) slew Sesai, and Ahiman, and Tholmai:</span></li>

    <li><span>And departing from thence he went to the inhabitants
    of Dabir, the ancient name of which was Cariath-Sepher, that
    is, the city of letters.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Caleb said: He that shall take Cariath-Sepher,
    and lay it waste, to him will I give my daughter Axa to
    wife.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Othoniel the son of Cenez, the younger brother of
    Caleb, having taken it, he gave him Axa his daughter to
    wife.</span></li>

    <li><span>And as she was going on her way her husband
    admonished her to ask a field of her father. And as she sighed
    sitting on her ass, Caleb said to her: What aileth
    thee?</span></li>

    <li><span>But she answered: Give me a blessing, for thou hast
    given me a dry land: give me also a watery land. So Caleb gave
    her the upper and the nether watery ground.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the children of the Cinite, the kinsman of Moses,
    went up from the city of palms, with the children of Juda into
    the wilderness of his lot, which is at the south side of Arad,
    and they dwelt with him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Juda went with Simeon his brother, and they
    together defeated the Chanaanites that dwelt in Sephaath, and
    slew them. And the name of the city was called Horma, that is,
    Anathema.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Juda took Gaza with its confines, and Ascalon and
    Accaron with their confines.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord was with Juda, and he possessed the hill
    country: but was not able to destroy the inhabitants of the
    valley, because they had many chariots armed with
    scythes.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said, who
    destroyed out of it the three sons of Enac.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the sons of Benjamin did not destroy the
    Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem: and the Jebusite hath dwelt
    with the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem until this present
    day.</span></li>

    <li><span>The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and
    the Lord was with them.</span></li>

    <li><span>For when they were besieging the city, which before
    was called Luza,</span></li>

    <li><span>They saw a man coming out of the city, and they said
    to him: Shew us the entrance into the city, and we will shew
    thee mercy.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had shewn them, they smote the city with
    the edge of the sword: but that man and all his kindred they
    let go:</span></li>

    <li><span>Who being sent away, went into the land of Hethim,
    and built there a city, and called it Luza: which is so called
    until this day.</span></li>

    <li><span>Manasses also did not destroy Bethsan, and Thanac
    with their villages, nor the inhabitants of Dor, and Jeblaam,
    and Mageddo with their villages. And the Chanaanite began to
    dwell with them.</span></li>

    <li><span>But after Israel was grown strong he made them
    tributaries, and would not destroy them.</span></li>

    <li><span>Ephraim also did not slay the Chanaanite that dwelt
    in Gazer, but dwelt with him.</span></li>

    <li><span>Zabulon destroyed not the inhabitants of Cetron, and
    Naalol: but the Chanaanite dwelt among them, and became their
    tributaries.</span></li>

    <li><span>Aser also destroyed not the inhabitants of Accho, and
    of Sidon, of Ahalab, and of Achazib, and of Helba, and of
    Aphec, and of Rohob:</span></li>

    <li><span>And he dwelt in the midst of the Chanaanites the
    inhabitants of that land, and did not slay them.</span></li>

    <li><span>Nephtali also destroyed not the inhabitants of
    Bethsames, and of Bethanath: and he dwelt in the midst of the
    Chanaanites the inhabitants of the land, and the Bethsamites
    and Bethanites were tributaries to him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Amorrhite straitened the children of Dan in
    the mountain, and gave them not place to go down to the
    plain:</span></li>

    <li><span>And he dwelt in the mountain Hares, that is, of
    potsherds, in Aialon and Salebim. And the hand of the house of
    Joseph was heavy upon him, and he became tributary to
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the border of the Amorrhite was from the ascent
    of the scorpion, the rock, and the higher places.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="2">Judges 2</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And an angel of the Lord went up from Galgal to the
    place of weepers, and said: I made you go out of Egypt, and
    have brought you into the land for which I swore to your
    fathers: and I promised that I would not make void my covenant
    with you for ever:</span></li>

    <li><span>On condition that you should not make a league with
    the inhabitants of this land, but should throw down their
    altars: and you would not hear my voice: why have you done
    this?</span></li>

    <li><span>Wherefore I would not destroy them from before your
    face: that you may have enemies, and their gods may be your
    ruin.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the angel of the Lord spoke these words to
    all the children of Israel, they lifted up their voice, and
    wept.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the name of that place was called, The place of
    weepers, or of tears: and there they offered sacrifices to the
    Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Josue sent away the people, and the children of
    Israel went every one to his own possession to hold
    it:</span></li>

    <li><span>And they served the Lord all his days, and the days
    of the ancients, that lived a long time after him, and who knew
    all the works of the Lord, which he had done for
    Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Josue the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord,
    died, being a hundred and ten years old,</span></li>

    <li><span>And they buried him in the borders of his possession
    in Thamnathsare in mount Ephraim, on the north side of mount
    Gaas.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all that generation was gathered to their
    fathers: and there arose others that knew not the Lord, and the
    works which he had done for Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of
    the Lord, and they served Baalim.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they left the Lord the God of their fathers, who
    had brought them out of the land of Egypt: and they followed
    strange gods, and the gods of the people that dwelt round about
    them, and they adored them: and they provoked the Lord to
    anger.</span></li>

    <li><span>Forsaking him, and serving Baal and
    Astaroth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord being angry against Israel, delivered
    them into the hands of plunderers: who took them and sold them
    to their enemies, that dwelt round about: neither could they
    stand against their enemies:</span></li>

    <li><span>But whithersoever they meant to go, the hand of the
    Lord was upon them, as he had said, and as he had sworn to
    them: and they were greatly distressed.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord raised up judges, to deliver them from
    the hands of those that oppressed them: but they would not
    hearken to them,</span></li>

    <li><span>Committing fornication with strange gods, and adoring
    them. They quickly forsook the way, in which their fathers had
    walked: and hearing the commandments of the Lord, they did all
    things contrary.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the Lord raised them up judges, in their
    days he was moved to mercy, and heard the groanings of the
    afflicted, and delivered them from the slaughter of the
    oppressors.</span></li>

    <li><span>But after the judge was dead, they returned, and did
    much worse things than their fathers had done, following
    strange gods, serving them and adoring them. They left not
    their own inventions, and the stubborn way, by which they were
    accustomed to walk.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the wrath of the Lord was kindled against Israel,
    and he said: Behold this nation hath made void my covenant,
    which I had made with their fathers, and hath despised to
    hearken to my voice:</span></li>

    <li><span>I also will not destroy the nations which Josue left,
    when he died:</span></li>

    <li><span>That through them I may try Israel, whether they will
    keep the way of the Lord, and walk in it, as their fathers kept
    it, or not.</span></li>

    <li><span>The Lord therefore left all these nations, and would
    not quickly destroy them, neither did he deliver them into the
    hands of Josue.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="3">Judges 3</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>These are the nations which the Lord left, that by
    them he might instruct Israel, and all that had not known the
    wars of the Chanaanites:</span></li>

    <li><span>That afterwards their children might learn to fight
    with their enemies, and to be trained up to war:</span></li>

    <li><span>The five princes of the Philistines, and all the
    Chanaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hevites that dwelt in
    mount Libanus, from mount Baal Hermon to the entering into
    Emath.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he left them, that he might try Israel by them,
    whether they would hear the commandments of the Lord, which he
    had commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses, or
    not.</span></li>

    <li><span>So the children of Israel dwelt in the midst of the
    Chanaanite, and the Hethite, and the Amorrhite, and the
    Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite:</span></li>

    <li><span>And they took their daughters to wives, and they gave
    their own daughters to their sons, and they served their
    gods.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they did evil in the sight of the Lord, and they
    forgot their God, and served Baalim and Astaroth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord being angry with Israel, delivered them
    into the hands of Chusan Rasathaim king of Mesopotamia, and
    they served him eight years.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they cried to the Lord, who raised them up a
    saviour, and delivered them, to wit, Othoniel the son of Cenez,
    the younger brother of Caleb:</span></li>

    <li><span>And the spirit of the Lord was in him, and he judged
    Israel. And he went out to fight, and the Lord delivered into
    his hands Chusan Rasathaim king of Syria, and he overthrew
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the land rested forty years, and Othoniel the son
    of Cenez died.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the children of Israel did evil again in the
    sight of the Lord: who strengthened against them Eglon king of
    Moab: because they did evil in his sight.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he joined to him the children of Ammon, and
    Amalec: and he went and overthrew Israel, and possessed the
    city of palm trees.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the children of Israel served Eglon king of Moab
    eighteen years:</span></li>

    <li><span>And afterwards they cried to the Lord, who raised
    them up a saviour called Aod, the son of Gera, the son of
    Jemini, who used the left hand as well as the right. And the
    children of Israel sent presents to Eglon king of Moab by
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he made himself a two-edged sword, with a haft in
    the midst of the length of the palm of the hand, and was girded
    therewith under his garment on the right thigh.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he presented the gifts to Eglon king of Moab. Now
    Eglon was exceeding fat.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had presented the gifts unto him, he
    followed his companions that came along with him.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then returning from Galgal, where the idols were, be
    said to the king: I have a secret message to thee, O king. And
    he commanded silence: and all being gone out that were about
    him,</span></li>

    <li><span>Aod went in to him: now he was sitting in a summer
    parlour alone, and he said: I have a word from God to thee. And
    he forthwith rose up from his throne,</span></li>

    <li><span>And Aod put forth his left hand, and took the dagger
    from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly,</span></li>

    <li><span>With such force that the haft went in after the blade
    into the wound, and was closed up with the abundance of fat. So
    that he did not draw out the dagger, but left it in his body as
    he had struck it in. And forthwith by the secret parts of
    nature the excrements of the belly came out.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Aod carefully shutting the doors of the parlour
    and locking them,</span></li>

    <li><span>Went out by a postern door. And the king's servants
    going in, saw the doors of the parlour shut, and they said:
    Perhaps he is easing nature in his summer parlour.</span></li>

    <li><span>And waiting a long time till they were ashamed, and
    seeing that no man opened the door, they took a key: and
    opening, they found their lord lying dead on the
    ground.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Aod, while they were in confusion, escaped, and
    passed by the place of the idols, from whence he had returned.
    And he came to Seirath:</span></li>

    <li><span>And forthwith he sounded the trumpet in mount
    Ephraim: and the children of Israel went down with him, he
    himself going in the front.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to them: Follow me: for the Lord hath
    delivered our enemies the Moabites into our hands. And they
    went down after him, and seized upon the fords of the Jordan,
    which are in the way to Moab: and they suffered no man to pass
    over.</span></li>

    <li><span>But they slew of the Moabites at that time, about ten
    thousand, all strong and Valiant men: none of them could
    escape.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moab was humbled that day under the hand of
    Israel: and the land rested eighty years.</span></li>

    <li><span>After him was Samgar the son of Anath, who slew of
    the Philistines six hundred men with a ploughshare: and he also
    defended Israel.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="4">Judges 4</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And the children of Israel again did evil in the
    sight of the Lord after the death of Aod,</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord delivered them up into the hands of
    Jaban king of Chanaan, who reigned in Asor: and he had a
    general of his army named Sisara, and he dwelt in Haroseth of
    the Gentiles.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the children of Israel cried to the Lord: for he
    had nine hundred chariots set with scythes, and for twenty
    years had grievously oppressed them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And there was at that time Debbora a prophetess the
    wife of Lapidoth, who judged the people,</span></li>

    <li><span>And she sat under a palm tree, which was called by
    her name, between Rama and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the
    children of Israel came up to her for all judgment.</span></li>

    <li><span>And she sent and called Barac the son of Abinoem out
    of Cedes in Nephtali: and she said to him: The Lord God of
    Israel hath commanded thee: Go, and lead an army to mount
    Thabor, and thou shalt take with thee ten thousand fighting men
    of the children of Nephtali, and of the children of
    Zabulon:</span></li>

    <li><span>And I will bring unto thee in the place of the
    torrent Cison, Sisara the general of Jabin's army, and his
    chariots, and all his multitude, and will deliver them into thy
    hand.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Barac said to her: If thou wilt come with me, I
    will go: if thou wilt not come with me, I will not
    go.</span></li>

    <li><span>She said to him: I will go indeed with thee, but at
    this time the victory shall not be attributed to thee, because
    Sisara shall be delivered into the hand of a woman. Debbora
    therefore arose, and went with Barac to Cedes.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he called unto him Zabulon and Nepbtali, and went
    up with ten thousand fighting men, having Debbora in his
    company.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now Haber the Cinite had some time before departed
    from the rest of the Cinites his brethren the sons of Hobab,
    the kinsman of Moses: and had pitched his tents unto the valley
    which is called Sellnim, and was near Cedes.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it was told Sisara, that Barac the son of
    Ablinoem was gone up to mount Thabor:</span></li>

    <li><span>And he gathered together his nine hundred chariots
    armed with scythes, and all his army from Haroseth of the
    Gentiles to the torrent Cison.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Debbora said to Barac: Arise, for this is the day
    wherein the Lord hath delivered Sisara into thy hands: behold
    he is thy leader. And Barac went down from mount Thabor, and
    ten thousand fighting men with him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord struck a terror into Sisara, and all his
    chariots, and all his multitude, with the edge of the sword, at
    the sight of Barac, insomuch that Sisara leaping down from off
    his chariot, fled away on foot.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Barac pursued after the fleeing chariots and the
    army unto Haroseth of the Gentiles, and all the multitude of
    the enemies was utterly destroyed.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Sisara fleeing came to the tent of Jahel the wife
    of Haber the Cinite, for there was peace between Jabin the king
    of Asor, and the house of Haber the Cinite.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jahel went forth to meet Sisara, and said to him:
    Come in to me, my lord, come in, fear not. He went in to her
    tent, and being covered by her with a cloak,</span></li>

    <li><span>Said to her: Give me, I beseech thee, a little water,
    for I am very thirsty. She opened a bottle of milk, and gave
    him to drink, and covered him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Sisara said to her: Stand before the door of the
    tent, and when any shall come and inquire of thee, saying: Is
    there any man here? thou shalt say: There is none.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Jahel Haber's wife took a nail of the tent, and
    taking also a hammer: and going in softly, and with silence,
    she put the nail upon the temples of his head, and striking it
    With the hammer, drove it through his brain fast into the
    ground: and so passing from deep sleep to death, he fainted
    away and died.</span></li>

    <li><span>And behold Barac came pursuing after Sisara: and
    Jahel went out to meet him, and said to him: Come, and I will
    shew thee, the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her
    tent, be saw Sisara lying dead, and the nail fastened in his
    temples.</span></li>

    <li><span>So God that day humbled Jabin the king of Chanaan
    before the children of Israel:</span></li>

    <li><span>Who grew daily stronger, and with a mighty hand
    overpowered Jabin king of Chanaan, till they quite destroyed
    him.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="5">Judges 5</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>In that day Debbora and Barac son of Abinoem sung,
    and said:</span></li>

    <li><span>O you of Israel, that have willingly offered your
    lives to danger, bless the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>Hear, O ye kings, give ear, ye princes: It is I, it
    is I, that will sing to the Lord, I will sing to the Lord the
    God of Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>O Lord, when thou wentest out of Seir, and passedst
    by the regions of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens
    dropped water.</span></li>

    <li><span>The mountains melted before the face of the Lord, and
    Sinai before the face of the Lord the God of
    Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>In the days of Samgar the son of Anath, in the days
    of Jahel the paths rested: and they that went by them, walked
    through by-ways.</span></li>

    <li><span>The valiant men ceased, and rested in Israel: until
    Debbora arose, a mother arose in Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>The Lord chose new wars, and he himself overthrew the
    gates of the enemies: a shield and spear was not seen among
    forty thousand of Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>My heart loveth the princes of Israel: O you that of
    your own good will offered yourselves to danger, bless the
    Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>Speak, you that ride upon fair asses, and you that
    sit in judgment, and walk in the way.</span></li>

    <li><span>Where the chariots were dashed together, and the army
    of the enemies was choked, there let the justices of the Lord
    be rehearsed, and his clemency towards the brave men of Israel:
    then the people of the Lord went down to the gates, and
    obtained the sovereignty.</span></li>

    <li><span>Arise, arise, O Debbora, arise, arise, and utter a
    canticle. Arise, Barac, and take hold of thy captives, O son of
    Abinoem.</span></li>

    <li><span>The remnants of the people are saved, the Lord hath
    fought among the valiant ones.</span></li>

    <li><span>Out of Ephraim he destroyed them into Amalec, and
    after him out of Benjamin into thy people, O Amalec: Out of
    Machir there came down princes, and out of Zabulon they that
    led the army to fight.</span></li>

    <li><span>The captains of Issachar were with Debbora, and
    followed the steps of Barac, who exposed himself to danger, as
    one going headlong, and into a pit. Ruben being divided against
    himself, there was found a strife of courageous
    men.</span></li>

    <li><span>Why dwellest thou between two borders, that thou
    mayest hear the bleatings of the flocks? Ruben being divided
    against himself, there was found a strife of courageous
    men.</span></li>

    <li><span>Galaad rested beyond the Jordan, and Dan applied
    himself to ships: Aser dwelt on the sea shore, and abode in the
    havens.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Zabulon and Nephtali offered their lives to death
    in the region of Merome.</span></li>

    <li><span>The kings came and fought, the kings of Chanaan
    fought in Thanach by the waters of Mageddo, and yet they took
    no spoils.</span></li>

    <li><span>War from heaven was made against them, the stars
    remaining in their order and courses fought against
    Sisara.</span></li>

    <li><span>The torrent of Cison dragged their carcasses, the
    torrent of Cadumim, the torrent of Cisoii: tread thou, my soul,
    upon the strong ones.</span></li>

    <li><span>The hoofs of the horses were broken whilst the
    stoutest of the enemies fled amain, and fell headlong
    down.</span></li>

    <li><span>Curse ye the land of Meroz, said the angel of the
    Lord: curse the inhabitants thereof, because they came not to
    the help of the Lord, to help his most valiant men.</span></li>

    <li><span>Blessed among women be Jahel the wife of Haber the
    Cinite, and blessed be she in her tent.</span></li>

    <li><span>He asked her water and she gave him milk, and offered
    him butter in a dish fit for princes.</span></li>

    <li><span>She put her left hand to the nail, and her right hand
    to the workman's hammer, and she struck Sisara, seeking in his
    head a place for the wound, and strongly piercing through his
    temples.</span></li>

    <li><span>At her feet he fell: he fainted, and he died: he
    rolled before her feet, and he lay lifeless and
    wretched.</span></li>

    <li><span>His mother looked out at a window, and howled: and
    she spoke from the dining room: Why is his chariot so long in
    coming back? Why are the feet of his horses so
    slow?</span></li>

    <li><span>One that was wiser than the rest of his wives,
    returned this answer to her mother in law:</span></li>

    <li><span>Perhaps he is now dividing the spoils, and the
    fairest of the women is chosen out for him: garments of divers
    colours are given to Sisara for his prey, and furniture of
    different kinds is heaped together to adorn the
    necks.</span></li>

    <li><span>So let all thy enemies perish, O Lord: but let them
    that love thee shine, as the sun shineth in his
    rising.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the land rested for forty years.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="6">Judges 6</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And the children of Israel again did evil in the
    sight of the Lord: and he delivered them into the hand of
    Madian seven years.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they were grievously oppressed by them. And they
    made themselves dens and eaves in the mountains, and strong
    holds to resist.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Israel had sown, Madian and Amalec, and the
    rest of the eastern nations came up:</span></li>

    <li><span>And pitching their tents among them, wasted all
    things as they were in the blade even to the entrance of Gaza:
    and they left nothing at all in Israel for sustenance of life,
    nor sheep, nor oxen, nor asses.</span></li>

    <li><span>For they and all their flocks came with their tents,
    and like locusts filled all places, an innumerable multitude of
    men, and of camels, wasting whatsoever they
    touched.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Israel was humbled exceedingly in the sight of
    Madian.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he cried to the Lord desiring help against the
    Madianites.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he sent unto them a prophet, and he spoke: Thus
    saith the Lord the God of Israel: I made you to come up out of
    Egypt, and brought you out of the house of bondage,</span></li>

    <li><span>And delivered you out of the hands of the Egyptians,
    and of all the enemies that afflicted you: and I cast them out
    at your coming in, and gave you their land.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I said: I am the Lord your God, fear not the gods
    of the Amorrhites, in whose land you dwell. And you would not
    hear my voice.</span></li>

    <li><span>And an angel of the Lord came, and sat under an oak,
    that was in Ephra, and belonged to Joas the father of the
    family of Ezri. And when Gedeon his son was threshing and
    cleansing wheat by the winepress, to flee from
    Madian,</span></li>

    <li><span>The angel of the Lord appeared to him, and said: The
    Lord is with thee, O most valiant of men.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Gedeon said to him: I beseech thee, my lord, if
    the Lord be with us, why have these evils fallen upon us? Where
    are his miracles, which our fathers have told us of, saying:
    The Lord brought us Out of Egypt? but now the Lord hath
    forsaken us, and delivered us into the bands of
    Madian.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord looked upon him, and said: Go in this
    thy strength, and then shalt deliver Israel out of the hand of
    Madian: know that I have sent thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>He answered and said: I beseech thee, my lord,
    wherewith shall I deliver Israel? Behold my family is the
    meanest in Manasses, and I am the least in my father's
    house.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to him: I will be with thee: and
    thou shalt cut off Madian as one man.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said: If I have found grace before thee, give
    me a sign that it is thou that speakest to me,</span></li>

    <li><span>And depart not hence, till I return to thee, and
    bring a sacrifice, and offer it to thee. And he answered: I
    will wait thy coming.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Gedeon went in, and boiled a kid, and made
    unleavened loaves of a measure of flour: and putting the flesh
    in a basket, and the broth of the flesh into a pot, he carried
    all under the oak, and presented to him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the angel of the Lord said to him: Take the flesh
    and the unleavened loaves, and lay them upon that rock, and
    pour out the broth thereon. And when he had done
    so,</span></li>

    <li><span>The angel of the Lord put forth the tip of the rod,
    which he held in his hand, and touched the flesh and the
    unleavened loaves: and there arose a fire from the rock, and
    consumed the flesh and the unleavened loaves: and the angel of
    the Lord vanished out of his sight.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Gedeon seeing that it was the angel of the Lord,
    said: Alas, my Lord God: for I have seen the angel of the Lord
    face to face.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to him: Peace be with thee: fear
    not, thou shalt not die.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Gedeon built there an altar to the Lord, and
    called it the Lord's peace, until this present day. And when he
    was yet in Ephra, which is of the family of Ezri,</span></li>

    <li><span>That night the Lord said to him: Take a bullock of
    thy father's, and another bullock of seven years, and thou
    shalt destroy the altar of Baal, which is thy father's: and cut
    down the grove that is about the altar:</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt build an altar to the Lord thy God in
    the top of this rock, whereupon thou didst lay the sacrifice
    before: and thou shalt take the second bullock, and shalt offer
    a holocaust upon a pile of the wood, which thou shalt cut down
    out of the grove.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Gedeon taking ten men of his servants, did as
    the Lord had commanded him. But fearing his father's house, and
    the men of that city, he would not do it by day, but did all by
    night.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the men of that town were risen in the
    morning, they saw the altar of Baal destroyed, and the grove
    cut down, and the second bullock laid upon the altar, which
    then was built.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they said one to another: Who hath done this? And
    when they inquired for the author of the fact, it was said:
    Gedeon the son of Joas did all this.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they said to Joas: Bring out thy son hither, that
    he may die: because he hath destroyed the altar of Baal, and
    hath cut down his grove.</span></li>

    <li><span>He answered them: Are you the avengers of Baal, that
    you fight for him? he that is his adversary, let him die before
    to morrow light appear: if he be a god, let him revenge himself
    on him that hath cast down his altar.</span></li>

    <li><span>From that day Gedeon was called Jerobaal, because
    Joss had said: Let Baal revenge himself on him that hath cast
    down his altar.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now all Madian, and Amalec, and the eastern people
    were gathered together, and passing over the Jordan, camped in
    the valley of Jezrael.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the spirit of the Lord came upon Gedeon, and be
    sounded the trumpet and called together the house of Abiezer,
    to follow him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he sent messengers into all Manasses, and they
    also followed him: and other messengers into Aser and Zabulon
    and Nephtali, and they came to meet him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Gedeon said to God: If thou wilt save Israel by
    my hand, as thou hast said,</span></li>

    <li><span>I will put this fleece of wool on the floor: if there
    be dew on the fleece only, and it be dry on all the ground
    beside, I, shall know that by my hand, as thou hast said, thou
    wilt deliver Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it was so. And rising before day wringing the
    fleece, he filled a vessel with the dew.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said again to God: let not thy wrath be
    kindled against me if I try once more, seeking a sign in the
    fleece. I pray that the fleece only may be dry, and all the
    ground wet with dew.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God did that night as he had requested: and it
    was dry on the fleece only, and there was dew on all the
    ground.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="7">Judges 7</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Then Jerobaal, who is the same as Gedeon, rising up
    early and all the people with him, came to the fountain that is
    called Harad. Now the camp of Madian was in the valley on the
    north side of the high hill.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Gedeon: The people that are with
    thee are many, and Madian shall not be delivered into their
    hands: lest Israel should glory against me, and say: I was
    delivered by my own strength.</span></li>

    <li><span>Speak to the people, and proclaim in the hearing of
    all, I Whosoever is fearful and timorous, let him return. So
    two and twenty thousand men went away from mount Galaad and
    returned home, and only ten thousand remained.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Gedeon: The people are still too
    many, bring them to the waters, and there I will try them: and
    of whom I shall say to thee, This shall go with thee, let him
    go: whom I shall forbid to go, let him return.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the people were come down to the waters, the
    Lord said to Gedeon: They that shall lap the water with their
    tongues, as dogs are wont to lap, thou shalt set apart by
    themselves: but they that shall drink bowing down their knees,
    shall be on the other side.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the number of them that had lapped water, casting
    it with the hand to their mouth, was three hundred men: and all
    the rest of the multitude had drunk kneeling.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Gedeon: By the three hundred
    men, that lapped water, I will save you, and deliver Madian
    into thy hand: but let all the rest of the people return to
    their place.</span></li>

    <li><span>So taking victuals and trumpets according to their
    number, he ordered all the rest of the multitude to depart to
    their tents: and he with the three hundred gave himself to the
    battle. Now the camp of Madian was beneath him in the
    valley.</span></li>

    <li><span>The same night the Lord said to him: Arise, and go
    down into the camp: because I have delivered them into thy
    hand.</span></li>

    <li><span>But if thou be afraid to go alone, let Phara thy
    servant go down with thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when thou shalt hear what they are saying, then
    shall thy hands be strengthened, and thou shalt go down more
    secure to the enemies' camp. And he went down with Phara his
    servant into part of the camp, where was the watch of men in
    arms.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Madian and Amalec, and all the eastern people lay
    scattered in the valley, as a multitude of locusts: their
    camels also were innumerable as the sand that lieth on the sea
    shore.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Gedeon was come, one told his neighbour a
    dream: and in this manner related what he had seen: I dreamt a
    dream, and it seemed to me as if a hearth cake of barley bread
    rolled and came down into the camp of Madian: and when it was
    come to a tent it struck it, and beat it down flat to the
    ground.</span></li>

    <li><span>He to whom he spoke, answered: This is nothing else
    but the sword of Gedeon the son of Joas a man of Israel. For
    the Lord hath delivered Madian, and all their camp into his
    hand.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Gedeon had heard the dream, and the
    interpretation thereof, he adored: and returned to the camp of
    Israel, and said: Arise, for the Lord hath delivered the camp
    of Madian into our hands.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he divided the three hundred men into three
    parts, and gave them trumpets in their hands, and empty
    pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to them: What you shall see me do, do you
    the same: I will go into one part of the camp, and do you as I
    shall do.</span></li>

    <li><span>When the trumpet shall sound in my hand, do you also
    blow the trumpets on every side of the camp.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Gedeon, and the three hundred men that were with
    him, went into part of the camp, at the beginning of the
    midnight watch, and the watchmen being alarmed, they began to
    sound their trumpets, and to clap the pitchers one against
    another.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they sounded their trumpets in three places
    round about the camp, and had broken their pitchers, they held
    their lamps in their left hands, and with their right hands the
    trumpets which they blew, and they cried out: The sword of the
    Lord and of Gedeon;</span></li>

    <li><span>Standing every man in his place round about the
    enemies' camp. So all the camp was troubled, and crying out and
    howling they fled away.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the three hundred men nevertheless persisted
    sounding the trumpets. And the Lord sent the sword into all the
    camp, and they killed one another,</span></li>

    <li><span>Fleeing as far as Bethsetta, and the border of
    Abelmahula in Tebbath. But the men of Israel shouting from
    Nephtali and Aser, and from all Manasses pursued after
    Madian.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Gedeon sent messengers into all mount Ephraim,
    saying: Come down to meet Madian, and take the waters before
    them to Bethbera and the Jordan. And all Ephraim shouted, and
    took the waters before them and the Jordan as far as
    Bethbera.</span></li>

    <li><span>And having taken two men of Madian, Oreb and Zeb:
    Oreb they slew in the rock of Oreb, and Zeb in the winepress of
    Zeb. And they pursued Madian, carrying the heads of Oreb and
    Zeb to Gedeon beyond the waters of the Jordan.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="8">Judges 8</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And the men of Ephraim said to him: What is this that
    thou meanest to do, that thou wouldst not call us when thou
    wentest to fight against Madian? and they chid him sharply and
    almost offered violence.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he answered them: What could I have done like to
    that which you have done? Is not one bunch of grapes of Ephraim
    better than the vintages of Abiezer?</span></li>

    <li><span>The Lord hath delivered into your bands the princes
    of Madian, Oreb and Zeb: what could I have done like to what
    you have done? And when he had said this, their spirit was
    appeased, with which they swelled against him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Gedeon was come to the Jordan, he passed
    over it with the three hundred men, that were with him: who
    were so weary that they could not pursue after them that
    fled.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to the men of Soccoth: Give, I beseech
    you, bread to the people that is with me, for they are faint:
    that we may pursue Zebee, and Salmana the kings of
    Madian.</span></li>

    <li><span>The princes of Soccoth answered: Peradventure the
    palms of the hands of Zebee and Salmana are in thy hand, and
    therefore thou demandest that we should give bread to thy
    army.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to them: When the Lord therefore shall
    have delivered Zebee and Salmana into my hands, I will thresh
    your flesh with the thorns and briers of the
    desert.</span></li>

    <li><span>And going up from thence, he came to Phanuel: and he
    spoke the like things to the men of that place. And they also
    answered him, as the men of Soccoth had answered.</span></li>

    <li><span>He said therefore to them also: When I shall return a
    conqueror in peace, I will destroy this tower.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Zebee and Salmana were resting with all their
    army. For fifteen thousand men were left of all the troops of
    the eastern people, and one hundred and twenty thousand
    warriors that drew the sword, were slain.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Gedeon went up by the way of them that dwelt in
    tents, on the east of Nobe and Jegbaa, and smote the camp of
    the enemies, who were secure, and suspected no
    hurt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Zebee and Salmana fled, and Gedeon pursued and
    took them, all their host being put in confusion.</span></li>

    <li><span>And returning from the battle before the sun
    rising,</span></li>

    <li><span>He took a boy of the men of Soccoth: and he asked him
    the names of the princes and ancients of Soccoth, and he
    described unto him seventy-seven men.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he came to Soccoth and said to them: Behold Zebee
    and Salmana, concerning whom you upbraided me, saying:
    Peradventure the hands of Zebee and Salmana, are in thy hands,
    and therefore thou demandest that we should give bread to the
    men that are weary and faint.</span></li>

    <li><span>So he took the ancients of the city and thorns and
    briers of the desert, and tore them with the same, and cut in
    pieces the men of Soccoth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he demolished the tower of Phanuel, and slew the
    men of the city.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to Zebee and Salmana: What manner of men
    were they whom you slew in Thabor? They answered: They were
    like thee, and one of them as the son of a king.</span></li>

    <li><span>He answered them: They were my brethren, the sons of
    my mother. As the Lord liveth, if you had saved them, I would
    not kill you.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to Jether his eldest son: Arise, and slay
    them. But he drew not his sword: for he was afraid, being but
    yet a boy.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Zebee and Salmana said: Do thou rise, and run
    upon us: because the strength of a man is according to his age:
    Gedeon rose up and slew Zebee and Salmana: and he took the
    ornaments and bosses, with which the necks of the camels of
    kings are wont to be adorned.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the men of Israel said to Gedeon: Rule thou
    over us and thy son, and thy son's son: because thou hast
    delivered us from the hand of Madian.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to them: I will not rule over you,
    neither shall my son rule over you, but the Lord shall rule
    over you.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to them: I desire one request of you:
    Give me the earlets of your spoils. For the Ismaelites were
    accustomed to wear golden earlets.</span></li>

    <li><span>They answered: We will give them most willingly. And
    spreading a mantle on the ground, they cast upon it the earlets
    of the spoils.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the weight of the earlets that he requested, was
    a thousand seven hundred sicles of gold, besides the ornaments,
    and jewels, and purple raiment which the kings of Madian were
    went to use, and besides the golden chains that were about the
    camels' necks.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Gedeon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his
    city Ephra. And all Israel committed fornication with it, and
    it became a ruin to Gedeon and to all his house.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Madian was humbled before the children of Israel,
    neither could they any more lift up their beads: but the land
    rested for forty years, while Gedeon presided.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Jerobaal the son of Joas went, and dwelt in his
    own house.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he had seventy sons, who came out of his thigh,
    for he had many wives.</span></li>

    <li><span>And his concubine, that he had in Sichem, bore him a
    son, whose name was Abimelech.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Gedeon the son of Joas died in a good old age,
    and was buried in the sepulchre of his father in Ephra of the
    family of Ezri.</span></li>

    <li><span>But after Gedeon was dead, the children of Israel
    turned again, and committed fornication with Baalim. And they
    made a covenant with Baal, that he should be their
    god:</span></li>

    <li><span>And they remembered not the Lord their God, who
    delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies round
    about:</span></li>

    <li><span>Neither did they shew mercy to the house of Jerobaal
    Gedeon, according to all the good things he had done to
    Israel.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="9">Judges 9</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And Abimelech the son of Jerobaal went to Sichem to
    his mother's brethren and spoke to them, and to all the kindred
    of his mother's father, saying:</span></li>

    <li><span>Speak to all the men of Sichem: whether is better for
    you that seventy men all the sons of Jerobaal should rule over
    you, or that one man should rule over you? And withal consider
    that I am your bone, and your flesh.</span></li>

    <li><span>And his mother's brethren spoke of him to all the men
    of Sichem, all these words, and they inclined their hearts
    after Abimelech, saying: He is our brother:</span></li>

    <li><span>And they gave him seventy weight of silver out of the
    temple of Baalberith: wherewith he hired to himself men that
    were needy, and vagabonds, and they followed him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he came to his father's house in Ephra, and slew
    his brethren the sons of Jerobaal, seventy men, upon one stone:
    and there remained only Joatham the youngest son of Jerobaal,
    who was hidden.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the men of Sichem were gathered together, and
    all the families of the city of Mello: and they went and made
    Abimelech king, by the oak that stood in Sichem.</span></li>

    <li><span>This being told to Joatham, he went and stood on the
    top of mount Garizim: and lifting up his voice, he cried, and
    said: Hear me, ye men of Sichem, so may God hear
    you.</span></li>

    <li><span>The trees went to anoint a king over them: and they
    said to the olive tree: Reign thou over us.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it answered: Can I leave my fatness, which both
    gods and men make use of, to come to be promoted among the
    trees?</span></li>

    <li><span>And the trees said to the fig tree: Come thou and
    reign over us.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it answered them: Can I leave my sweetness, and
    my delicious fruits, and go to be promoted among the other
    trees?</span></li>

    <li><span>And the trees said to the vine: Come thou and reign
    over us.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it answered them: Can I forsake my wine, that
    cheereth God and men, and be promoted among the other
    trees?</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the trees said to the bramble: Come thou and
    reign over us.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it answered them: If indeed you mean to make me
    king, come ye and rest under my shadow: but if you mean it not,
    let fire come out from the bramble, and devour the cedars of
    Libanus.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now therefore if you have done well, and without sin
    in appointing Abimelech king over you, and have dealt well with
    Jerobaal, and with his house, and have made a suitable return
    for the benefits of him, who fought for you,</span></li>

    <li><span>And exposed his life to dangers, to deliver you from
    the hands of Madian,</span></li>

    <li><span>And you are now risen up against my father's house,
    and have killed his sons seventy men upon one stone, and have
    made Abimelech the son of his handmaid king over the
    inhabitants of Sichem, because he is your brother:</span></li>

    <li><span>If therefore you have dealt well, and without fault
    with Jerobaal, and his house, rejoice ye this day in Abimelech,
    and may he rejoice in you.</span></li>

    <li><span>But if unjustly: let fire come out from him, and
    consume the inhabitants of Sichem, and the town of Mello: and
    let fire come out from the men of Sichem, and from the town of
    Mello, and devour Abimelech.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had said thus he fled, and went into
    Bera: and dwelt there for fear of Abimelech his
    brother.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Abimelech reigned over Israel for three
    years.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord sent a very evil spirit between
    Abimelech and the inhabitants of Sichem: who began to detest
    him,</span></li>

    <li><span>And to leave the crime of the murder of the seventy
    sons of Jerobaal, and the shedding of their blood upon
    Abimelech their brother, and upon the rest of the princes of
    the Sichemites, who aided him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they set an ambush against him on the top of the
    mountains: and while they waited for his coming, they committed
    robberies, taking spoils of all that passed by: and it was told
    Abimelech.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Gaal the son of Obed came with his brethren, and
    went over to Sichem. And the inhabitants of Sichem taking
    courage at his coming,</span></li>

    <li><span>Went out into the fields, wasting the vineyards, and
    treading down the grapes: and singing and dancing they went
    into the temple of their god, and in their banquets and cups
    they cursed Abimelech.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Gaal the son of Obed cried: Who is Abimelech, and
    what is Sichem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of
    Jerobaal, and hath made Zebul his servant ruler over the men of
    Emor the father of Sichem? Why then shall we serve
    him?</span></li>

    <li><span>Would to God that some man would put this people
    under my hand, that I might remove Abimelech out of the way.
    And it was said to Abimelech: Gather together the multitude of
    an army, and come.</span></li>

    <li><span>For Zebul the ruler of the city, hearing the words of
    Gaal, the son of Obed, was very angry,</span></li>

    <li><span>And sent messengers privately to Abimelech, saying:
    Behold Gaal the son of Obed is come into Sichem with his
    brethren, and endeavoureth to set the city against
    thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>Arise therefore in the night with the people that is
    with thee and he hid in the field:</span></li>

    <li><span>And betimes in the morning at sun rising set upon the
    city. And when he shall come out against thee with his people,
    do to him what thou shalt be able.</span></li>

    <li><span>Abimelech therefore arose with all his army by night,
    and laid ambushes near Sichem in four places.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Gaal the son of Obed went out, and stood in the
    entrance of the gate of the city. And Abimelech rose up, and
    all his army with him from the places of the
    ambushes.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul:
    Behold a multitude cometh down from the mountains. And he
    answered him: Thou seest the shadows of the mountains as if
    they were the heads of men, and this is thy
    mistake.</span></li>

    <li><span>Again Gaal said: Behold there cometh people down from
    the middle of the land, and one troop cometh by the way that
    looketh towards the oak.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Zebul said to him: Where is now thy mouth
    wherewith thou saidst? Who is Abimelech that we should serve
    him? Is not this the people which thou didst despise? Go out,
    and fight against him.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Gaal went out in the sight of the people of
    Sichem, and fought against Abimelech,</span></li>

    <li><span>Who chased and put him to flight, and drove him to
    the city: and many were slain of his people, even to the gate
    of the city:</span></li>

    <li><span>And Abimelech sat down in Ruma: but Zebul drove Gaal,
    and his companions out of the city, and would not suffer them
    to abide in it.</span></li>

    <li><span>So the day following the people went out into the
    field. And it was told Abimelech.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he took his army, and divided it into three
    companies, and laid ambushes in the fields. And seeing that the
    people came out of the city, he arose and set upon
    them,</span></li>

    <li><span>With his own company, assaulting and besieging the
    city: whilst the two other companies chased the enemies that
    were scattered about the field.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Abimelech assaulted the city all that day: and
    took it, and killed the inhabitants thereof, and demolished it,
    so that he sowed salt in it.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they who dwelt in the tower of Sichem had
    heard this, they went into the temple of their god Berith where
    they had made a covenant with him, and from thence the place
    had taken its name, and it was exceeding strong.</span></li>

    <li><span>Abimelech also hearing that the men of the tower of
    Sichem were gathered together,</span></li>

    <li><span>Went up into mount Selmon he and all his people with
    him: and taking an axe, he cut down the bough of a tree, and
    laying it on his shoulder and carrying it, he said to his
    companions: What you see me do, do you out of hand.</span></li>

    <li><span>So they cut down boughs from the trees, every man as
    fast as he could, and followed their leader. And surrounding
    the fort they set it on fire: and so it came to pass that with
    the smoke and with the fire a thousand persons were killed, men
    and women together, of the inhabitants of the tower of
    Sichem.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Abimelech departing from thence came to the town
    of Thebes, which he surrounded and besieged with his
    army.</span></li>

    <li><span>And there was in the midst of the city a high tower,
    to which both the men and the women were fled together, and all
    the princes of the city, and having shut and strongly barred
    the gate, they stood upon the battlements of the tower to
    defend themselves.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Abimelech coming near the tower, fought stoutly:
    and approaching to the gate, endeavoured to set fire to
    it:</span></li>

    <li><span>And behold a certain woman casting a piece of a
    millstone from above, dashed it against the head of Abimelech,
    and broke his skull.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he called hastily to his armourbearer, and said
    to him: Draw thy sword, and kill me: lest it should be said
    that I was slain by a woman. He did as he was commanded, and
    slew him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he was dead, all the men of Israel that were
    with him, returned to their homes.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God repaid the evil, that Abimelech had done
    against his father, killing his seventy brethren.</span></li>

    <li><span>The Sichemites also were rewarded for what they had
    done, and the curse of Joatham the son of Jerobaal came upon
    them.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="10">Judges 10</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>After Abimelech there arose a ruler in Israel, Thola
    son of Phua the uncle of Abimelech, a man of Issachar, who
    dwelt in Samir of mount Ephraim:</span></li>

    <li><span>And he judged Israel three and twenty years, and he
    died and was buried in Samir.</span></li>

    <li><span>To him succeeded Jair the Galaadite, who judged
    Israel for two and twenty years.</span></li>

    <li><span>Having thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and
    were princes of thirty cities, which from his name were called
    Havoth Jair, that is, the towns of Jair, until this present day
    in the land of Galaad.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jair died: and was buried in the place which was
    called Camon.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the children of Israel, adding new sins to their
    old ones, did evil in the sight of the Lord, and served idols,
    Baalim and Astaroth, and the gods of Syria and of Sidon and of
    Moab and of the children of Ammon and of the Philistines: and
    they left the Lord, and did not serve him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord being angry with them, delivered them
    into the hands of the Philistines and of the children of
    Ammon.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they were afflicted, and grievously oppressed for
    eighteen years, all they that dwelt beyond the Jordan in the
    land of the Amorrhite, who is in Galaad:</span></li>

    <li><span>Insomuch that the children of Ammon passing over the
    Jordan, wasted Juda and Benjamin and Ephraim: and Israel was
    distressed exceedingly.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they cried to the Lord, and said: We have sinned
    against thee, because we have forsaken the Lord our God, and
    have served Baalim.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to them: Did not the Egyptians and
    the Amorrhites, and the children of Ammon and the
    Philistines,</span></li>

    <li><span>The Sidonians also and Amalec and Chanaan oppress
    you, and you cried to me, and I delivered you out of their
    hand?</span></li>

    <li><span>And yet you have forsaken me, and have worshipped
    strange gods: therefore I will deliver you no more:</span></li>

    <li><span>Go and call upon the gods which you have chosen: let
    them deliver you in the time of distress.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the children of Israel said to the Lord: We have
    sinned, do thou unto us whatsoever pleaseth thee: only deliver
    us this time.</span></li>

    <li><span>And saying these things, they cast away out of their
    coasts all the idols of strange gods and served the Lord their
    God: and he was touched with their miseries.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the children of Ammon shouting together, pitched
    their tents in Galaad: against whom the children of Israel
    assembled themselves together and camped in Maspha.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the princes of Galaad said one to another:
    Whosoever of us shall first begin to fight against the children
    of Ammon, he shall be the leader of the people of
    Galaad.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="11">Judges 11</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>There was at that time Jephte the Galaadite, a most
    valiant man and a warrior, the son of a woman that was a
    harlot, and his father was Galaad.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now Galaad had a wife of whom he had sons: who after
    they were grown up, thrust out Jephte, saying: Thou canst not
    inherit in the house of our father, because thou art born of
    another mother.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then he fled and avoided them and dwelt in the land
    of Tob: and there were gathered to him needy men, and robbers,
    and they followed him as their prince.</span></li>

    <li><span>In those days the children of Ammon made war against
    Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And as they pressed hard upon them, the ancients of
    Galaad went to fetch Jephte out of the land of Tob to help
    them:</span></li>

    <li><span>And they said to him: Come thou and be our prince,
    and fight against the children of Ammon.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he answered them: Are not you the men that hated
    me, and cast me out of my father's house, and now you are come
    to me constrained by necessity?</span></li>

    <li><span>And the princes of Galaad said to Jephte: For this
    cause we are now come to thee, that thou mayst go with us, and
    fight against the children of Ammon, and be head over all the
    inhabitants of Galaad.</span></li>

    <li><span>Jephte also said to them: If you be come to me
    sincerely, that I should fight for you against the children of
    Ammon, and the Lord shall deliver them into my band, shall I be
    your prince?</span></li>

    <li><span>They answered him: The Lord who heareth these things,
    he himself is mediator and witness that we will do as we have
    promised.</span></li>

    <li><span>Jephte therefore went with the princes of Galaad, and
    all the people made him their prince. And Jephte spoke all his
    words before the Lord in Maspha.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he sent messengers to the king of the children of
    Ammon, to say in his name, What hast thou to do with me, that
    thou art come against me, to waste my land?</span></li>

    <li><span>And he answered them: I Because Israel took away my
    land when he came up out of Egypt, from the confines of the
    Arnon unto the Jaboc and the Jordan: now therefore restore the
    same peaceably to me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jephte again sent word by them, and commanded
    them to say to the king of Ammon:</span></li>

    <li><span>Thus saith Jephte: Israel did not take away the land
    of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:</span></li>

    <li><span>But when they came up out of Egypt, he walked through
    the desert to the Red Sea and came into Cades.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying:
    Suffer me to pass through thy land. But he would not condescend
    to his request. He sent also to the king of Moab, who likewise
    refused to give him passage. He abode therefore in
    Cades,</span></li>

    <li><span>And went round the land of Edom at the side, and the
    land of Moab: and came over against the east coast of the land
    of Moab, and camped on the other side of the Arnon: and he
    would not enter the bounds of Moab.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Israel sent messengers to Sehon king of the
    Amorrhites, who dwelt in Hesebon, and they said to him: Suffer
    me to pass through thy land to the river.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he also despising the words of Israel, suffered
    him not to pass through his borders: but gathering an infinite
    multitude, went out against him to Jasa, and made strong
    opposition.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord delivered him with all his army into the
    hands of Israel, and he slew him, and possessed all the land of
    the Amorrhite the inhabitant of that country,</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the coasts thereof from the Arnon to the
    Jaboc, and from the wilderness to the Jordan.</span></li>

    <li><span>So the Lord the God of Israel destroyed the
    Amorrhite, his people of Israel fighting against him, and wilt
    thou now possess this land?</span></li>

    <li><span>Are not those things which thy god Chamos possesseth,
    due to thee by right? But what the Lord our God hath obtained
    by conquest, shall be our possession:</span></li>

    <li><span>Unless perhaps thou art better than Balac the son of
    Sephor king of Moab: or canst shew that he strove against
    Israel and fought against him,</span></li>

    <li><span>Whereas he hath dwelt in Hesebon, and the villages
    thereof, and in Aroer, and its villages, and in all the cities
    near the Jordan, for three hundred years. Why have you for so
    long a time attempted nothing about this claim?</span></li>

    <li><span>Therefore I do not trespass against thee, but thou
    wrongest me by declaring an unjust war against me. The Lord be
    judge and decide this day between Israel and the children of
    Ammon.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the king of the children of Ammon would not
    hearken to the words of Jephte, which he sent him by the
    messengers.</span></li>

    <li><span>Therefore the spirit of the Lord came upon Jephte,
    and going round Galaad, and Manasses, and Maspha of Galaad, and
    passing over from thence to the children of Ammon,</span></li>

    <li><span>He made a vow to the Lord, saying: If thou wilt
    deliver the children of Ammon into my hands,</span></li>

    <li><span>Whosoever shall first come forth out of the doors of
    my house, and shall meet me when I return in peace from the
    children of Ammon, the same will I offer a holocaust to the
    Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jephte passed over to the children of Ammon, to
    fight against them: and the Lord delivered them into his
    hands.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he smote them from Aroer till you come to
    Mennith, twenty cities, and as far as Abel, which is set with
    vineyards, with a very great slaughter: and the children of
    Ammon were humbled by the children of Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Jephte returned into Maspha to his house,
    his only daughter met him with timbrels and with dances: for he
    had no other children.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he saw her, he rent his garments, and said:
    Alas! my daughter, thou hast deceived me, and thou thyself art
    deceived: for I have opened my mouth to the Lord, and I can do
    no other thing.</span></li>

    <li><span>And she answered him: My father, if thou hast opened
    thy mouth to the Lord, do unto me whatsoever thou hast
    promised, since the victory hath been granted to thee, and
    revenge of thy enemies.</span></li>

    <li><span>And she said to her father: Grant me only this which
    I desire: Let me go, that I may go about the mountains for two
    months, and may bewail my virginity with my
    companions.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he answered her: Go. And he sent her away for two
    months. And when she was gone with her comrades and companions,
    she mourned her virginity in the mountains.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the two months being expired, she returned to her
    father, and he did to her as he had vowed, and she knew no man.
    From thence came a fashion in Israel, and a custom has been
    kept:</span></li>

    <li><span>That from year to year the daughters of Israel
    assemble together, and lament the daughter of Jephte the
    Galaadite for four days.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="12">Judges 12</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>But behold there arose a sedition in Ephraim. And
    passing towards the north, they said to Jephte: When thou
    wentest to fight against the children of Ammon, why wouldst
    thou not call us, that we might go with thee? Therefore we will
    burn thy house.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he answered them: I and my people were at great
    strife with the children of Ammon: and I called you to assist
    me, and you would not do it.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when I saw this, I put my life in my own hands,
    and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the Lord
    delivered them into my hands. What have I deserved, that you
    should rise up to fight against me?</span></li>

    <li><span>Then calling to him all the men of Galaad, he fought
    against Ephraim: and the men of Galaad defeated Ephraim,
    because he had said: Galaad is a fugitive of Ephraim, and
    dwelleth in the midst of Ephraim and Manasses.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Galaadites secured the fords of the Jordan,
    by which Ephraim was to return. And when any one of the number
    of Ephraim came thither in the flight, and said: I beseech you
    let me pass: the Galaadites said to him: Art thou not an
    Ephraimite? If he said: I am not:</span></li>

    <li><span>They asked him: Say then, Scibboleth, which is
    interpreted, An ear of corn. But he answered, Sibboleth, not
    being able to express an ear of corn by the same letter. Then
    presently they took him and killed him in the very passage of
    the Jordan. And there fell at that time of Ephraim two and
    forty thousand.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jephte the Galaadite judged Israel six years: and
    he died, and was buried in his city of Galaad.</span></li>

    <li><span>After him Abesan of Bethlehem judged
    Israel:</span></li>

    <li><span>He had thirty sons, and as many daughters, whom he
    sent abroad, and gave to husbands, and took wives for his sons
    of the same number, bringing them into his house. And he judged
    Israel seven years:</span></li>

    <li><span>And he died, and was buried in Bethlehem.</span></li>

    <li><span>To him succeeded Ahialon a Zahnlonite: and he judged
    Israel ten years:</span></li>

    <li><span>And he died, and was buried in ZahnIon.</span></li>

    <li><span>After him Abdon, the son of Illel, a Pharathonite,
    judged Israel:</span></li>

    <li><span>And he had forty sons, and of them thirty grandsons,
    mounted upon seventy ass colts, and he judged Israel eight
    years:</span></li>

    <li><span>And he died, and was buried in Pharathon in the land
    of Ephraim, in the mount of Amalech.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="13">Judges 13</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And the children of Israel did evil again in the
    sight of the Lord: and he delivered them into the hands of the
    Philistines forty years.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now there was a certain man of Saraa, and of the race
    of Dan, whose name was Manue, and his wife was
    barren.</span></li>

    <li><span>And an angel of the Lord appeared to her, and said:
    Thou art barren and without children: but thou shalt conceive
    and bear a son.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now therefore beware and drink no wine nor strong
    drink, and eat not any unclean thing.</span></li>

    <li><span>Because thou shalt conceive and bear a son, and no
    razor shall touch his head: for he shall be a Nazarite of God,
    from his infancy, and from his mother's womb, and he shall
    begin to deliver Israel from the hands of the
    Philistines.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when she was come to her husband she said to him:
    A man of God came to me, having the countenance of an angel,
    very awful. And when I asked him who he was, and whence he
    came, and by what name he was called, he would not tell
    me.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he answered thus: Behold thou shalt conceive and
    bear a son: beware thou drink no wine, nor strong drink, nor
    eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite of God
    from his infancy, from his mother's womb until the day of his
    death.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Manue prayed to the Lord, and said: I beseech
    thee, O Lord, that the mail of God, whom thou didst send, may
    come again, and teach us what we ought to do concerning the
    child that shall be born.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord heard the prayer of Manue, and the angel
    of the Lord appeared again to his wife as she was sitting in
    the field. But Manue her husband was not with her. And when she
    saw the angel,</span></li>

    <li><span>She made haste and ran to her husband: and told him
    saying: Behold the man hath appeared to me whom I saw
    before.</span></li>

    <li><span>He rose up and followed his wife: and coming to the
    man, said to him: Art thou he that spoke to the woman? And he
    answered: I am.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Manue said to him: When thy word shall come to
    pass, what wilt thou that the child should do? or from what
    shall he keep himself?</span></li>

    <li><span>And the angel of the Lord said to Manue: From all the
    things I have spoken of to thy wife, let her refrain
    herself:</span></li>

    <li><span>And let her eat nothing that cometh of the vine,
    neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean
    thing: and whatsoever I have commanded her, let her fulfil and
    observe.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Manue said to the angel of the Lord: I beseech
    thee to consent to my request, and let us dress a kid for
    thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the angel answered him: If thou press me, I will
    not eat of thy bread: but if thou wilt offer a holocaust, offer
    it to the Lord. And Manue knew not it was the angel of the
    Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to him: What is thy name, that, if thy
    word shall come to pass, we may honour thee?</span></li>

    <li><span>And he answered him: Why askest thou my name, which
    is wonderful?</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Manue took a kid of the flocks, and the
    libations, and put them upon a rock, offering to the Lord, who
    doth wonderful things: and he and his wife looked
    on.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the flame from the altar went up towards
    heaven, the angel of the lord ascended also in the flame. And
    when Manue and his wife saw this, they fell flat on the
    ground.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the angel of the Lord appeared to them no more.
    And forthwith Manue understood that it was an angel of the
    Lord,</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to his wife: We shall certainly die,
    because we have seen God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And his wife answered him: If the Lord had a mind to
    kill us, he would not have received a holocaust and libations
    at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things,
    nor have told us the things that are to come.</span></li>

    <li><span>And she bore a son, and called his name Samson. And
    the child grew, and the Lord blessed him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the spirit of the Lord began to be with him in
    the camp of Dan, between Saraa and Esthaol.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="14">Judges 14</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Then Samson went down to Thamnatlia, and seeing there
    a woman of the daughters of the Philistines,</span></li>

    <li><span>He came up, and told his father and his mother,
    saying: I saw a woman in Thamnatha of the daughters of the
    Philistines: I beseech you, take her for me to
    wife.</span></li>

    <li><span>And his father and mother said to him: Is there no
    woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my
    people, that thou wilt take a wife of the Philistines, who are
    uncircumcised? And Samson said to his father: Take this woman
    for me, for she hath pleased my eyes.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now his parents knew not that the thing was done by
    the Lord, and that he sought an occasion against the
    Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over
    Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Samson went down with his father and mother to
    Thamnatha. And when they were come to the vineyards of the
    town, behold a young lion met him raging and
    roaring.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the spirit of the Lord came upon Samson, and he
    tore the lion as he would have torn a kid in pieces, having
    nothing at all in his hand: and he would not tell this to his
    father and mother.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he went down and spoke to the woman that had
    pleased his eyes.</span></li>

    <li><span>And after some days returning to take her, he went
    aside to see the carcass of the lion, and behold there was a
    swarm of bees in the mouth of the lion and a
    honeycomb.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when be had taken it in his hands, he went on
    eating: and coming to his father and mother, he gave them of
    it, and they ate: but he would not tell them, that he had taken
    the honey from the body of the lion.</span></li>

    <li><span>So his father went down to the woman, and made a
    feast for his son Samson: for so the young men used to
    do.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the citizens of that place saw him, they
    brought him thirty companions to be with him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Samson said to them: I will propose to you a
    riddle, which if you declare unto me within the seven days of
    the feast, I will give you thirty shirts, and as many
    coats:</span></li>

    <li><span>But if you shall not be able to declare it, you shall
    give me thirty shirts and the same number of coats. They
    answered him: Put forth the riddle that we may hear
    it.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to them: Out of the eater came forth
    meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they
    could not in three days expound the riddle.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the seventh day came, they said to the wife
    of Samson: Soothe thy husband, and persuade him to tell thee
    what the riddle meaneth. But if thou wilt not do it, we will
    burn thee, and thy father's house. Have you called us to the
    wedding on purpose to strip us?</span></li>

    <li><span>So she wept before Samson and complained, saying:
    Thou hatest me, and dost not love me: therefore thou wilt not
    expound to me the riddle which thou hast proposed to the sons
    of my people. But he answered: I would not tell it to my father
    and mother, and how can I tell it to thee?</span></li>

    <li><span>So she wept before him the seven days of the feast:
    and at length on the seventh day as she was troublesome to him,
    he expounded it. And she immediately told her
    countrymen.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they on the seventh day before the sun went down
    said to him: What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger
    than a lion? And he said to them: If you had not ploughed with
    my heifer, you had not found out my riddle.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he went
    down to Ascalon, and slew there thirty men, whose garments he
    took away and gave to them that had declared the riddle. And
    being exceeding angry he went up to his father's
    house:</span></li>

    <li><span>But his wife took one of his friends and bridal
    companions for her husband.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="15">Judges 15</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And a while after, when the days of the wheat harvest
    were at hand, Samson came, meaning to visit his wife, and he
    brought her a kid of the flock. And when he would have gone
    into her chamber as usual, her father would not suffer him,
    saying:</span></li>

    <li><span>I thought thou hadst hated her, and therefore I gave
    her to thy friend: but she hath a sister, who is younger and
    fairer than she, take her to wife instead of her.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Samson answered him: From this day I shall be
    blameless in what I do against the Philistines: for I will do
    you evils.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he went and caught three hundred foxes, and
    coupled them tail to tail, and fastened torches between the
    tails.</span></li>

    <li><span>And setting them on fire he let the foxes go, that
    they might run about hither and thither. And they presently
    went into the standing corn of the Philistines. Which being set
    on fire, both the corn that was already carried together, and
    that which was yet standing, was all burnt, insomuch, that the
    flame consumed also the vineyards and the
    oliveyards.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then the Philistines said: Who hath done this thing?
    And it was answered: Samson the son in law of the Thamnathite,
    because he took away his wife, and gave her to another, hath
    done these things. And the Philistines went up and burnt both
    the woman and her father.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Samson said to them: Although you have done this,
    yet will I be revenged of you, and then I will be
    quiet.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he made a great slaughter of them, so that in
    astonishment they laid the calf of the leg upon the thigh. And
    going down he dwelt in a cavern of the rock Etam.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then the Philistines going up into the land of Juda,
    camped in the place which afterwards was called Lechi, that is,
    the Jawbone, where their army was spread.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the men of the tribe of Juda said to them: Why
    are you come up against us? They answered: We are come to bind
    Samson, and to pay him for what he hath done against
    us.</span></li>

    <li><span>Wherefore three thousand men of Juda, went down to
    the cave of the rock Etam, and said to Samson: Knowest thou not
    that the Philistines rule over us? Why wouldst thou do thus?
    And he said to them: As they did to me, so have I done to
    them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they said to him, We are come to bind thee and to
    deliver thee into the hands of the Philistines. And Samson said
    to them: Swear to me, and promise me, that you will not kill
    me.</span></li>

    <li><span>They said: We will not kill thee: but we will deliver
    thee up bound. And they bound him with two new cords, and
    brought him from the rock Etam.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now when he was come to the place of the Jawbone, and
    the Philistines shouting went to meet him, the spirit of the
    Lord came strongly upon him: and as the flax is wont to be
    consumed at the approach of fire, so the bands with which he
    was bound were broken and loosed.</span></li>

    <li><span>And finding a jawbone, even the jawbone of an ass
    which lay there, catching it up, be slew therewith a thousand
    men.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said: With the jawbone of an ass, with the jaw
    of the colt of asses I have destroyed them, and have slain a
    thousand men.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had ended these words singing, he threw
    the jawbone out of his hand, and called the name of that place
    Ramathlechi, which is interpreted the lifting up of the
    jawbone.</span></li>

    <li><span>Arid being very thirsty, he cried to the Lord, and
    said: Thou hast given this very great deliverance and victory
    into the hand of thy servant: and behold I die for thirst, and
    shall fall into the hands of the uncircumcised.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then the Lord opened a great tooth in the jaw of the
    ass, and waters issued out of it. And when he had drank them he
    refreshed his spirit, and recovered his strength. Therefore the
    name of that place was called, The Spring of him that invoked
    from the jawbone, until this present day.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines
    twenty years.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="16">Judges 16</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>He went also into Gaza, and saw there a woman a
    harlot, and went in unto her.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the Philistines had beard this, and it was
    noised about among them, that Samson was come into the city,
    they surrounded him, setting guards at the gate of the city,
    and watching there all the night in silence, that in the
    morning they might kill him as he went out.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Samson slept till midnight, and then rising he
    took both the doors of the gate, with the posts thereof, and
    the bolt, and laying them on his shoulders, carried them up to
    the top of the hill, which looketh towards Hebron.</span></li>

    <li><span>After this he loved a woman, who dwelt in the valley
    of Sorec, and she was called Dalila.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the princes of the Philistines came to her, and
    said: Deceive him, and learn of him wherein his great strength
    lieth, and how we may be able to overcome him, to bind and
    afflict him: which if thou shalt do, we will give thee every
    one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Dalila said to Samson: Tell me, I beseech thee,
    wherein thy greatest strength lieth, and what it is wherewith
    if thou wert bound thou couldst not break loose.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Samson answered her: If I shall be bound with
    seven cords made of sinews not yet dry, but still moist, I
    shall be weak like other men.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the princes of the Philistines brought unto her
    seven cords, such is he spoke of, with which she bound
    him;</span></li>

    <li><span>Men lying privately in wait with her, and in the
    chamber expecting the event of the thing, and she cried out to
    him: The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he broke the
    bands, as a man would break a thread of tow twined with
    spittle, when it smelleth the fire: so it was not known wherein
    his strength Jay.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Dalila said to him: Behold thou hast mocked me,
    and hast told me a false thing: but now at least tell me
    wherewith thou mayest be bound.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he answered her: If I shall be bound with new
    ropes, that were never in work, I shall be weak and like other
    men.</span></li>

    <li><span>Dalila bound him again with these, and cried out: The
    Philistines are upon thee, Samson, there being an ambush
    prepared for him in the chamber. But he broke the bands like
    threads of webs.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Dalila said to him again: How long dost thou
    deceive me, and tell me lies? Shew me wherewith thou mayest be
    bound. And Samson answered her: If thou plattest the seven
    locks of my head with a lace, and tying them round about a nail
    fastenest it in the ground, I shall be weak.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Dalila had done this, she said to him: The
    Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And awaking out of his sleep
    he drew out the nail with the hairs and the lace.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Dalila said to him: How dost thou say thou lovest
    me, when thy mind is not with me? Thou hast told me lies these
    three times, and wouldst not tell me wherein thy great strength
    lieth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when she pressed him much, and continually hung
    upon him for many days, giving him no time to rest, his soul
    fainted away, and was wearied even until death.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then opening the truth of the thing, he said to her:
    The razor hath never come upon my head, for I am a Nazarite,
    that is to say, consecrated to God from my mother's womb: if my
    head be shaven, my strength shall depart from me, and I shall
    become weak, and shall be like other men.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then seeing that be had discovered to her all his
    mind, she sent to the princes of the Philistines, saying: Come
    up this once more, for now he hath opened his heart to me. And
    they went up taking with them the money which they had
    promised.</span></li>

    <li><span>But she made him sleep upon her knees, and lay his
    head in her bosom. And she called a barber, and shaved his
    seven locks, and began to drive him away, and thrust him from
    her: for immediately his strength departed from
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And she said: The Philistines are upon thee, Samson.
    And awaking from sleep, he said in his mind: I will go out as I
    did before, and shake myself, not knowing that the Lord was
    departed from him.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then the Philistines seized upon him, and forthwith
    pulled out his eyes, and led him bound in chains to Gaza, and
    shutting him up in prison made him grind.</span></li>

    <li><span>And now his hair began to grow again.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the princes of the Philistines assembled
    together, to offer great sacrifices to Dagon their god, and to
    make merry, saying: Our god hath delivered our enemy Samson
    into our hands.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the people also seeing this, praised their god,
    and said the same: Our god hath delivered our adversary into
    our bands, him that destroyed our country and killed very
    many.</span></li>

    <li><span>And rejoicing in their feasts, when they had now
    taken their good cheer, they commanded that Samson should be
    called, and should play before them. And being brought out of
    prison he played before them, and they made him stand between
    two pillars.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to the lad that guided his steps: Suffer
    me to touch the pillars which support the whole house, and let
    me lean upon them, and rest a little.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now the house was full of men and women, and all the
    princes of the Philistines were there. Moreover about three
    thousand persons of both sexes from the roof and the higher
    part of the house, were beholding Samson's play.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he called upon the Lord, saying: O Lord God,
    remember me, and restore to me now my former strength, O my
    God, that I may revenge myself on my enemies, and for the loss
    of my two eyes I may take one revenge.</span></li>

    <li><span>And laying hold on both the pillars on which the
    house rested, and holding the one with his right hand, and the
    other with his left,</span></li>

    <li><span>He said: Let me die with the Philistines. And when he
    had strongly shook the pillars, the house fell upon all the
    princes, and the rest of the multitude that was there: and he
    killed many more at his death, than he had killed before in his
    life.</span></li>

    <li><span>And his brethren and all his kindred, going down took
    his body, and buried it between Saraa and Esthaol in the
    buryingplace of his father Manue: and he judged Israel twenty
    years.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="17">Judges 17</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>There was at that time a man of mount Ephraim whose
    name was Michas,</span></li>

    <li><span>Who said to his mother: The eleven hundred pieces of
    silver, which thou hadst put aside for thyself, and concerning
    which thou didst swear in my hearing, behold I have, and they
    are with me. And she said to him: Blessed be my son by the
    Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>So he restored them to his mother, who said to him: I
    have consecrated and vowed this silver to the Lord, that my son
    may receive it at my hand, and make a graven and a molten god,
    so now I deliver it to thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he restored them to his mother: and she took two
    hundred pieces of silver and gave them to the silversmith, to
    make of them a graven and a molten god, which was in the house
    of Michas.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he separated also therein a little temple for the
    god, and made an ephod, and theraphim, that is to say, a
    priestly garment, and idols: and he filled the hand of one of
    his sons, and he became his priest.</span></li>

    <li><span>In those days there was no king in Israel, but every
    one did that which seemed right to himself.</span></li>

    <li><span>There was also another young man of Bethlehem Juda,
    of the kindred thereof: and he was a Levite, and dwelt
    there.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now he went out from the city of Bethlehem, and
    desired to sojourn wheresoever he should find it convenient for
    him. And when he was come to mount Ephraim, as he was on his
    journey, and had turned aside a little into the house of
    Michas,</span></li>

    <li><span>He was asked by him whence he came. And he answered:
    I am a Levite of Bethlehem Juda, and I am going to dwell where
    I can, and where I shall find a place to my
    advantage.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Michas said: Stay with me, and be unto me a
    father and a priest, and I will give thee every year ten pieces
    of silver, and a double suit of apparel, and thy
    victuals.</span></li>

    <li><span>He was content, and abode with the man, and was unto
    him as one of his sons.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Michas filled his hand, and had the young man
    with him, for his priest, saying:</span></li>

    <li><span>Now I know God will do me good, since I have a priest
    of the race of the Levites.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="18">Judges 18</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>In those days there was no king in Israel, and the
    tribe of Dan sought them an inheritance to dwell in: for unto
    that day they had not received their lot among the other
    tribes.</span></li>

    <li><span>So the children of Dan sent five most valiant men of
    their stock and family from Saraa and Esthaol, to spy out the
    land, and to view it diligently: and they said to them: Go, and
    view the land. They went on their way, and when they came to
    mount Ephraim, they went into the house of Michas, and rested
    there:</span></li>

    <li><span>And knowing the voice of the young man the Levite,
    and lodging with him, they said to him: Who brought thee
    hither? what dost thou here? why wouldst thou come
    hither?</span></li>

    <li><span>He answered them: Michas hath done such and such
    things for me, and hath hired me to be his priest.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then they desired him to consult the Lord, that they
    might know whether their journey should be prosperous, and the
    thing should have effect.</span></li>

    <li><span>He answered them: Go in peace, the Lord looketh on
    your way, and the journey that you go.</span></li>

    <li><span>So the five men going on came to Lais: and they saw
    how the people dwelt therein without any fear, according to the
    custom of the Sidonians, secure and easy, having no man at all
    to oppose them, being very rich, and living separated, at a
    distance from Sidon and from all men.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they returned to their brethren in Saraa and
    Esthaol, who asked them what they had done? to whom they
    answered:</span></li>

    <li><span>Arise, and let us go up to them: for we have seen the
    land which is exceeding rich and fruitful: neglect not, lose no
    time: let us go and possess it, there will be no
    difficulty.</span></li>

    <li><span>We shall come to a people that is secure, into a
    spacious country, and the Lord will deliver the place to us, in
    which there is no want of any thing that groweth on the
    earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>There went therefore of the kindred of Dan, to wit,
    from Saraa and Esthaol, six hundred men, furnished with arms
    for war,</span></li>

    <li><span>And going up they lodged in Cariathiarim of Juda:
    which place from that time is called the camp of Dan, and is
    behind Cariathiarim.</span></li>

    <li><span>From thence they passed into mount Ephraim. And when
    they were come to the house of Michas,</span></li>

    <li><span>The five men, that before had been sent to view the
    land of Lais, said to the rest of their brethren: You know that
    in these houses there is an ephod, and theraphim, and a graven,
    and a molten god: see what you are pleased to do.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they had turned a little aside, they went
    into the house of the young man the Levite, who was in the
    house of Michas: and they saluted him with words of
    peace.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the six hundred men stood before the door,
    appointed with their arms.</span></li>

    <li><span>But they that were gone into the house of the young
    man, went about to take away the graven god, and the ephod, and
    the theraphim, and the molten god, and the priest stood before
    the door, the six hundred valiant men waiting not far
    off.</span></li>

    <li><span>So they that were gone in took away the graven thing,
    the ephod, and the idols, and the molten god. And the priest
    said to them: What are you doing?</span></li>

    <li><span>And they said to him: Hold thy peace and put thy
    finger on thy mouth and come with us, that we may have thee for
    a father, and a priest. Whether is better for thee, to be a
    priest in the house of one man, or in a tribe and family in
    Israel?</span></li>

    <li><span>When he had heard this, he agreed to their words, and
    took the ephod, and the idols, and the graven god, and departed
    with them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they were going forward, and had put before
    them the children and the cattle and all that was
    valuable,</span></li>

    <li><span>And were now at a distance from the house of Michas,
    the men that dwelt in the houses of Michas gathering together
    followed them,</span></li>

    <li><span>And began to shout out after them. They looked back,
    and said to Michas: What aileth thee? Why dost thou
    cry?</span></li>

    <li><span>And he answered: You have taken away my gods which I
    have made me and the priest, and all that I have, and do you
    say: What aileth thee?</span></li>

    <li><span>And the children of Dan said to him: See thou say no
    more to us, lest men enraged come upon thee, and thou perish
    with all thy house.</span></li>

    <li><span>And so they went on the journey they had begun. But
    Michas seeing that they were stronger than he, returned to his
    house.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the six hundred men took the priest, and the
    things we spoke of before, and came to Lais to a people that
    was quiet and secure, and smote them with the edge of the
    sword: and the city was burnt with fire,</span></li>

    <li><span>There being no man at all who brought them any
    succour, because they dwelt far from Sidon, and had no society
    or business with any man. And the city was in the land of
    Rohob: and they rebuilt it and dwelt therein.</span></li>

    <li><span>Calling the name of the city Dan after the name of
    their father, who was the son of Israel, which before was
    called Lais.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they set up to themselves the graven idol, and
    Jonathan the son of Gersam the son of Moses, he and his sons
    were priests in the tribe of Dan, until the day of their
    captivity.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the idol of Michas remained with them all the
    time that the house of God was in Silo. In those days there was
    no king in Israel.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="19">Judges 19</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>There was a certain Levite, who dwelt on the side of
    mount Ephraim, who took a wife of Bethlehem Juda:</span></li>

    <li><span>And she left him and returned to her father's house
    in Bethlehem, and abode with him four months.</span></li>

    <li><span>And her husband followed her, willing to be
    reconciled with her, and to speak kindly to her, and to bring
    her back with him, having with him a servant and two asses: and
    she received him, and brought him into her father's house. And
    when his father in law had heard this, and had seen him, he met
    him with joy,</span></li>

    <li><span>And embraced the man. And the son in law tarried in
    the house of his father in law three days, eating with him and
    drinking familiarly.</span></li>

    <li><span>But on the fourth day arising early in the morning he
    desired to depart. But his father in law kept him, and said to
    him: Taste first a little bread, and strengthen thy stomach,
    and so thou shalt depart.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they sat down together, and ate and drank. And
    the father of the young woman said to his son in law: I beseech
    thee to stay here to day, and let us make merry
    together.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he rising up began to be for departing. And
    nevertheless his father in law earnestly pressed him, and made
    him stay with him.</span></li>

    <li><span>But when morning was come, the Levite prepared to go
    on his journey. And his father in law said to him again: I
    beseech thee to take a little meat, and strengthening thyself,
    till the day be farther advanced, afterwards thou mayest
    depart. And they ate together.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the young man arose to set forward with his wife
    and servant. And his father in law spoke to him again: Consider
    that the day is declining, and draweth toward evening: tarry
    with me to day also, and spend the day in mirth, and to morrow
    thou shalt depart, that thou mayest go into thy
    house.</span></li>

    <li><span>His son in law would not consent to his words: but
    forthwith went forward and came over against Jebus, which by
    another name is called Jerusalem, leading with him two asses
    laden, and his concubine.</span></li>

    <li><span>And now they were come near Jebus, and the day was
    far spent: and the servant said to his master: Come, I beseech
    thee, let us turn into the city of the Jebusites, and lodge
    there.</span></li>

    <li><span>His master answered him: I will not go into the town
    of another nation, who are not of the children of Israel, but I
    will pass over to Gabaa:</span></li>

    <li><span>And when I shall come thither, we will lodge there,
    or at least in the city of Rama.</span></li>

    <li><span>So they passed by Jebus, and went on their journey,
    and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gabaa, which
    is in the tribe of Benjamin:</span></li>

    <li><span>And they turned into it, to lodge there. And when
    they were come in, they sat in the street of the city, for no
    man would receive them to lodge.</span></li>

    <li><span>And behold they saw an old man, returning out of the
    field and from his work in the evening, and he also was of
    mount Ephraim, and dwelt as a stranger in Gabaa; but the men of
    that country were the children of Jemini.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the old man lifting up his eyes, saw the man
    sitting with his bundles in the street of the city, and said to
    him: Whence comest thou? and whither goest thou?</span></li>

    <li><span>He answered him: We came out from Bethlehem Juda, and
    we are going to our home, which is on the side of mount
    Ephraim, from whence we went to Bethlehem: and now we go to the
    house of God, and none will receive us under his
    roof:</span></li>

    <li><span>We have straw and hay for provender of the asses, and
    bread and wine for the use of myself and of thy handmaid, and
    of the servant that is with me: we want nothing but
    lodging.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the old man answered him: Peace be with thee: I
    will furnish all things that are necessary: only I beseech
    thee, stay not in the street.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he brought him into his house, and gave provender
    to his asses: and after they had washed their feet, he
    entertained them with a feast.</span></li>

    <li><span>While they were making merry, and refreshing their
    bodies with meat and drink, after the labour of the journey,
    the men of that city, sons of Belial, (that is, without yoke,)
    came and beset the old man's house, and began to knock at the
    door, calling to the master of the house, and saying: Bring
    forth the man that came into thy house, that we may abuse
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the old man went out to them, and said: Do not
    so, my brethren, do not so wickedly: because this man is come
    into my lodging, and cease I pray you from this
    folly.</span></li>

    <li><span>I have a maiden daughter, and this man hath a
    concubine, I will bring them out to you, and you may humble
    them, and satisfy your lust: only, I beseech you, commit not
    this crime against nature on the man.</span></li>

    <li><span>They would not be satisfied with his words; which the
    man seeing, brought out his concubine to them, and abandoned
    her to their wickedness: and when they had abused her all the
    night, they let her go in the morning.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the woman, at the dawning of the day, came to the
    door of the house where her lord lodged, and there fell
    down.</span></li>

    <li><span>And in the morning the man arose, and opened the door
    that he might end the journey he had begun: and behold his
    concubine lay before the door with her hands spread on the
    threshold.</span></li>

    <li><span>He thinking she was taking her rest, said to her:
    Arise, and let us be going. But as she made no answer,
    perceiving she was dead, he took her up, and laid her upon his
    ass, and returned to his house.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he was come home he took a sword, and
    divided the dead body of his wife with her bones into twelve
    parts, and sent the pieces into all the borders of
    Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when every one had seen this, they all cried out:
    There was never such a thing done in Israel from the day that
    our fathers came up out of Egypt, until this day: give
    sentence, and decree in common what ought to be
    done.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="20">Judges 20</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Then all the children of Israel went out and gathered
    together as one man from Dan to Bersabee, with the land of
    Galaad, to the Lord in Maspha:</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the chiefs of the people, and all the tribes
    of Israel met together in the assembly of the people of God,
    four hundred thousand footmen fit for war.</span></li>

    <li><span>(Nor were the children of Benjamin ignorant that the
    children of Israel were come up to Maspha.) And the Levite the
    husband of the woman that was killed, being asked, how so great
    a wickedness had been committed,</span></li>

    <li><span>Answered: I came into Gabaa of Benjamin with my wife,
    and there I lodged:</span></li>

    <li><span>And behold the men of that city in the night beset
    the house wherein I was, intending to kill me, and abused my
    wife with an incredible fury of lust, so that at last she
    died.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I took her and cut her in pieces, and sent the,
    parts into all the borders of your possession: because there
    never was so heinous a crime, and so great an abomination
    committed in Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>You are all here, O children of Israel, determine
    what you ought to do.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the people standing, answered as by the voice
    of one man: We will not return to our tents, neither shall any
    one of us go into his own house:</span></li>

    <li><span>But this we will do in common against
    Gabaa:</span></li>

    <li><span>We will take ten men of a hundred out of all the
    tribes of Israel, and a hundred out of a thousand, and a
    thousand out of ten thousand, to bring victuals for the army,
    that we might fight against Gabaa of Benjamin, and render to it
    for its wickedness, what it deserveth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all Israel were gathered together against the
    city, as one man, with one mind, and one counsel:</span></li>

    <li><span>And they sent messengers to all the tribe of Benjamin
    to say to them: Why hath so great an abomination been found
    among you?</span></li>

    <li><span>Deliver up the men of Gabaa, that have committed this
    heinous crime, that they may die, and the evil may be taken
    away out of Israel. But they would not hearken to the
    proposition of their brethren the children of
    Israel:</span></li>

    <li><span>But out of all the cities which were of their lot,
    they gathered themselves together into Gabaa, to aid them, and
    to fight against the whole people of Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And there were found of Benjamin five and twenty
    thousand men that drew the sword, besides the inhabitants of
    Gabaa,</span></li>

    <li><span>Who were seven hundred most valiant men, fighting
    with the left hand as well as with the right: and slinging
    stones so sure that they could hit even a hair, and not miss by
    the stone's going on either side.</span></li>

    <li><span>Of the men of Israel also, beside the children of
    Benjamin, were found four hundred thousand that drew swords,
    and were prepared to fight.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they arose and came to the house of God, that is,
    to Silo: and they consulted God, and said: Who shall be in our
    army the first to go to the battle against the children of
    Benjamin? And the Lord answered them: Let Juda be your
    leader.</span></li>

    <li><span>And forthwith the children of Israel rising in the
    morning, camped by Gabaa:</span></li>

    <li><span>And going out from thence to fight against Benjamin,
    began to assault the city.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the children of Benjamin coming out of Gabaa,
    slew of the children of Israel that day two and twenty thousand
    men.</span></li>

    <li><span>Again Israel trusting in their strength and their
    number, set their army in array in the same place, where they
    had fought before:</span></li>

    <li><span>Yet so that they first went up and wept before the
    Lord until night: and consulted him, and said: Shall I go out
    any more to fight against the children of Benjamin my brethren,
    or not? And he answered them: Go up against them, and join
    battle.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the children of Israel went out the next day
    to fight against the children of Benjamin,</span></li>

    <li><span>The children of Benjamin sallied forth out of the
    gates of Gabaa: and meeting them made so great a slaughter of
    them, as to kill eighteen thousand men that drew the
    sword.</span></li>

    <li><span>Wherefore all the children of Israel came to the
    house of God, and sat and wept before the Lord: and they fasted
    that day till the evening, and offered to him holocausts, and
    victims of peace offerings,</span></li>

    <li><span>And inquired of him concerning their state. At that
    time the ark of the covenant of the Lord was there,</span></li>

    <li><span>And Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron was
    over the house. So they consulted the Lord and said: Shall we
    go out any more to fight against the children of Benjamin our
    brethren, or shall we cease? And the Lord said to them: Go up,
    for to morrow I will deliver them into your hands.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the children of Israel set ambushes round about
    the city of Gabaa:</span></li>

    <li><span>And they drew up their army against Benjamin the
    third time, as they had done the first and second.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the children of Benjamin boldly issued out of the
    city, and seeing their enemies flee, pursued them a long way,
    so as to wound and kill some of them, as they had done the
    first and second day, whilst they fled by two highways, whereof
    one goeth up to Bethel, and the other to Gabaa, and they slew
    about thirty men:</span></li>

    <li><span>For they thought to cut them off, as they did before.
    But they artfully feigning a flight, designed to draw them away
    from the city, and by their seeming to flee to bring them to
    the highways aforesaid.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then all the children of Israel rising up out of the
    places where they were, set their army in battle array, in the
    place which is called Baalthamar. The ambushes also which were
    about the city, began by little and little to come
    forth,</span></li>

    <li><span>And to march from the west side of the city. And
    other ten thousand men chosen out of all Israel attacked the
    inhabitants of the city. And the battle grew hot against the
    children of Benjamin: and they understood not that present
    death threatened them on every side.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord defeated them before the children of
    Israel, and they slew of them in that day five and twenty
    thousand, and one hundred, all fighting men and that drew the
    sword.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the children of Benjamin when they saw themselves
    to be too weak, began to flee. Which the children of Israel
    seeing, gave them place to flee, that they might come to the
    ambushes that were prepared, which they had set near the
    city.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they that were in ambush arose on a sudden out of
    their coverts, and whilst Benjamin turned their backs to the
    slayers, went into the city, and smote it with the edge of the
    sword.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now the children of Israel had given a sign to them,
    whom they had laid in ambushes, that after they had taken the
    city, they should make a fire: that by the smoke rising on
    high, they might shew that the city was taken.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the children of Israel saw this in the
    battle (for the children of Benjamin thought they fled and
    pursued them vigorously, killing thirty men of their
    army)</span></li>

    <li><span>And perceived as it were a pillar of smoke rise up
    from the city; and Benjamin looking back, saw that the city was
    taken, and that the flames ascended on high:</span></li>

    <li><span>They that before had made as if they fled, turning
    their faces stood bravely against them; which the children of
    Benjamin seeing, turned their backs,</span></li>

    <li><span>And began to go towards the way of the desert, the
    enemy pursuing them thither also. And they that fired the city
    came also out to meet them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And so it was, that they were slain on both sides by
    the enemies, and there was no rest of their men dying. They
    fell and were beaten down on the east side of the city
    Gabaa.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they that were slain in the same place were
    eighteen thousand men, all most valiant soldiers.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they that remained of Benjamin saw this,
    they fled into the wilderness and made towards the rock that is
    called Remmon. In that flight, also as they were straggling and
    going different ways, they slew of them five thousand men. And
    as they went farther, they still pursued them, and slew also
    other two thousand.</span></li>

    <li><span>And so it came to pass, that all that were slain of
    Benjamin in divers places, were five and twenty thousand
    fighting men, most valiant for war.</span></li>

    <li><span>And there remained of all the number of Benjamin only
    six hundred men that were able to escape, and flee to the
    wilderness: and they abode in the rock Remmon four
    months.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the children of Israel returning, put all the
    remains of the city to the sword, both men and beasts, and all
    the cities and villages of Benjamin were consumed with
    devouring flames.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="21">Judges 21</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Now the children of Israel had also sworn in Maspha,
    saying: None of us shall give of his daughters to the children
    of Benjamin to wife.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they all came to the house of God in Silo, and
    abiding before him till the evening, lifted up their voices,
    and began to lament and weep, saying:</span></li>

    <li><span>O Lord God of Israel, why is so great an evil come to
    pass in thy people, that this day one tribe should be taken
    away from among us?</span></li>

    <li><span>And rising early the next day, they built an altar:
    and offered there holocausts, and victims of peace, and they
    said:</span></li>

    <li><span>Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came
    not up with the army of the Lord? for they had bound themselves
    with a great oath, when they were in Maspha, that whosoever
    were wanting should be slain.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the children of Israel being moved with
    repentance for their brother Benjamin, began to say: One tribe
    is taken away from Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>Whence shall they take wives? For we have all in
    general sworn, not to give our daughters to them.</span></li>

    <li><span>Therefore they said: Who is thereof all the tribes of
    Israel, that came not up to the Lord to Maspha. And behold the
    inhabitants of Jabes Galaad were found not to have been in that
    army.</span></li>

    <li><span>(At that time also when they were in Silo, no one of
    them was found there.)</span></li>

    <li><span>So they sent ten thousand of the most valiant men,
    and commanded them, saying: Go and put the inhabitants of Jabes
    Galaad to the sword, with their wives and their
    children.</span></li>

    <li><span>And this is what you shall observe: Every male, and
    all women that have known men, you shall kill, but the virgins
    you shall save.</span></li>

    <li><span>And there were found of Jabes Galaad four hundred
    virgins, that had not known the bed of a man, and they brought
    them to the camp Silo, into the land of Chanaan.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they sent messengers to the children of Benjamin,
    that were in the rock Remmon, and commanded them to receive
    them in peace.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the children of Benjamin came at that time, and
    wives were given them of the daughters of Jabes Galaad: but
    they found no others, whom they might give in like
    manner.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all Israel was very sorry, and repented for the
    destroying of one tribe out of Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the ancients said: What shall we do with the
    rest, that have not received wives? for all the women in
    Benjamin are dead.</span></li>

    <li><span>And we must use all care, and provide with great
    diligence, that one tribe be not destroyed out of
    Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>For as to our own daughters we cannot give them,
    being bound with an oath and a curse, whereby we said: Cursed
    be he that shall give Benjamin any of his daughters to
    wife.</span></li>

    <li><span>So they took counsel, and said: Behold there is a
    yearly solemnity of the Lord in Silo, which is situate on the
    north of the city of Bethel, and on the east side of the way,
    that goeth from Bethel to Sichem, and on the south of the town
    of Lebona.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they commanded the children of Benjamin, and
    said: Go, and lie hid in the vineyards,</span></li>

    <li><span>And when you shall see the daughters of Silo come
    out, as the custom is, to dance, come ye on a sudden out of the
    vineyards, and catch you every man his wife among them, and go
    into the land of Benjamin.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when their fathers and their brethren shall come,
    and shall begin to complain against you, and to chide, we will
    say to them: Have pity on them for they took them not away as
    by the right of war or conquest, but when they asked to have
    them, you gave them not, and the fault was committed on your
    part.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the children of Benjamin did, as they had been
    commanded: and according to their number, they carried off for
    themselves every man his wife of them that were dancing: and
    they went into their possession and built up their cities, and
    dwelt in them.</span></li>

    <li><span>The children of Israel also returned by their tribes,
    and families, to their dwellings. In those days there was no
    king in Israel: but every one did that which seemed right to
    himself.</span></li>
