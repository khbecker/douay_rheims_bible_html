<ol>
<li><span>The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him,
to make known to his servants the things which must shortly come to
pass: and signified, sending by his angel to his servant
John,</span></li>
<li><span>Who hath given testimony to the word of God, and the
testimony of Jesus Christ, what things soever he hath
seen.</span></li>
<li><span>Blessed is he, that readeth and heareth the words of this
prophecy; and keepeth those things which are written in it; for the
time is at hand.</span></li>
<li><span>John to the seven churches which are in Asia. Grace be
unto you and peace from him that is, and that was, and that is to
come, and from the seven spirits which are before his
throne,</span></li>
<li><span>And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the
first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the
earth, who hath loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own
blood,</span></li>
<li><span>And hath made us a kingdom, and priests to God and his
Father, to him be glory and empire for ever and ever.
Amen.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold, he cometh with the clouds, and every eye shall
see him, and they also that pierced him. And all the tribes of the
earth shall bewail themselves because of him. Even so.
Amen.</span></li>
<li><span>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, saith
the Lord God, who is, and who was, and who is to come, the
Almighty.</span></li>
<li><span>I John, your brother and your partner in tribulation, and
in the kingdom, and patience in Christ Jesus, was in the island,
which is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony
of Jesus.</span></li>
<li><span>I was in the spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind
me a great voice, as of a trumpet,</span></li>
<li><span>Saying: What thou seest, write in a book, and send to the
seven churches which are in Asia, to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to
Pergamus, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and
to Laodicea.</span></li>
<li><span>And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And
being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks:</span></li>
<li><span>And in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks, one
like to the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the feet,
and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.</span></li>
<li><span>And his head and his hairs were white, as white wool, and
as snow, and his eyes were as a flame of fire,</span></li>
<li><span>And his feet like unto fine brass, as in a burning
furnace. And his voice as the sound of many waters.</span></li>
<li><span>And he had in his right hand seven stars. And from his
mouth came out a sharp two edged sword: and his face was as the sun
shineth in his power.</span></li>
<li><span>And when I had seen him, I fell at his feet as dead. And
he laid his right hand upon me, saying: Fear not. I am the First
and the Last,</span></li>
<li><span>And alive, and was dead, and behold I am living for ever
and ever, and have the keys of death and of hell.</span></li>
<li><span>Write therefore the things which thou hast seen, and
which are, and which must be done hereafter.</span></li>
<li><span>The mystery of the seven stars, which thou sawest in my
right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are
the angels of the seven churches. And the seven candlesticks are
the seven churches.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="2">Apocalypse 2</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write: These
things saith he, who holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who
walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks:</span></li>
<li><span>I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and
how thou canst not bear them that are evil, and thou hast tried
them, who say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them
liars:</span></li>
<li><span>And thou hast patience, and hast endured for my name, and
hast not fainted.</span></li>
<li><span>But I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left
thy first charity.</span></li>
<li><span>Be mindful therefore from whence thou art fallen: and do
penance, and do the first works. Or else I come to thee, and will
move thy candlestick out of its place, except thou do
penance.</span></li>
<li><span>But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the
Nicolaites, which I also hate.</span></li>
<li><span>He, that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith
to the churches: To him, that overcometh, I will give to eat of the
tree of life, which is in the paradise of my God.</span></li>
<li><span>And to the angel of the church of Smyrna write: These
things saith the First and the Last, who was dead, and is
alive:</span></li>
<li><span>I know thy tribulation and thy poverty, but thou art
rich: and thou art blasphemed by them that say they are Jews and
are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.</span></li>
<li><span>Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer.
Behold, the devil will cast some of you into prison that you may be
tried: and you shall have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful
until death: and I will give thee the crown of life.</span></li>
<li><span>He, that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith
to the churches: He that shall overcome, shall not be hurt by the
second death.</span></li>
<li><span>And to the angel of the church of Pergamus write: These
things, saith he, that hath the sharp two edged sword:</span></li>
<li><span>I know where thou dwellest, where the seat of Satan is:
and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith. Even
in those days when Antipas was my faithful witness, who was slain
among you, where Satan dwelleth.</span></li>
<li><span>But I have against thee a few things: because thou hast
there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to
cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat, and to
commit fornication:</span></li>
<li><span>So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the
Nicolaites.</span></li>
<li><span>In like manner do penance: if not, I will come to thee
quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my
mouth.</span></li>
<li><span>He, that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith
to the churches: To him that overcometh, I will give the hidden
manna, and will give him a white counter, and in the counter, a new
name written, which no man knoweth, but he that receiveth
it.</span></li>
<li><span>And to the angel of the church of Thyatira write: These
things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like to a flame of
fire, and his feet like to fine brass.</span></li>
<li><span>I know thy works, and thy faith, and thy charity, and thy
ministry, and thy patience, and thy last works which are more than
the former.</span></li>
<li><span>But I have against thee a few things: because thou
sufferest the woman Jezabel, who calleth herself a prophetess, to
teach, and to seduce my servants, to commit fornication, and to eat
of things sacrificed to idols.</span></li>
<li><span>And I gave her a time that she might do penance, and she
will not repent of her fornication.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold, I will cast her into a bed: and they that commit
adultery with her shall be in very great tribulation, except they
do penance from their deeds.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will kill her children with death, and all the
churches shall know that I am he that searcheth the reins and
hearts, and I will give to every one of you according to your
works. But to you I say,</span></li>
<li><span>And to the rest who are at Thyatira: Whosoever have not
this doctrine, and who have not known the depths of Satan, as they
say, I will not put upon you any other burthen.</span></li>
<li><span>Yet that, which you have, hold fast till I
come.</span></li>
<li><span>And he that shall overcome, and keep my works unto the
end, I will give him power over the nations.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall rule them with a rod of iron, and as the
vessel of a potter they shall be broken,</span></li>
<li><span>As I also have received of my Father: and I will give him
the morning star.</span></li>
<li><span>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith
to the churches.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="3">Apocalypse 3</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And to the angel of the church of Sardis, write: These
things saith he, that hath the seven spirits of God, and the seven
stars: I know thy works, that thou hast the name of being alive:
and thou art dead.</span></li>
<li><span>Be watchful and strengthen the things that remain, which
are ready to die. For I find not thy works full before my
God.</span></li>
<li><span>Have in mind therefore in what manner thou hast received
and heard: and observe, and do penance. If then thou shalt not
watch, I will come to thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know at
what hour I will come to thee.</span></li>
<li><span>But thou hast a few names in Sardis, which have not
defiled their garments: and they shall walk with me in white,
because they are worthy.</span></li>
<li><span>He that shall overcome, shall thus be clothed in white
garments, and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life,
and I will confess his name before my Father, and before his
angels.</span></li>
<li><span>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith
to the churches.</span></li>
<li><span>And to the angel of the church of Philadelphia, write:
These things saith the Holy One and the true one, he that hath the
key of David; he that openeth, and no man shutteth; shutteth, and
no man openeth:</span></li>
<li><span>I know thy works. Behold, I have given before thee a door
opened, which no man can shut: because thou hast a little strength,
and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold, I will bring of the synagogue of Satan, who say
they are Jews, and are not, but do lie. Behold, I will make them to
come and adore before thy feet. And they shall know that I have
loved thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I will
also keep thee from the hour of the temptation, which shall come
upon the whole world to try them that dwell upon the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold, I come quickly: hold fast that which thou hast,
that no man take thy crown.</span></li>
<li><span>He that shall overcome, I will make him a pillar in the
temple of my God; and he shall go out no more; and I will write
upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God,
the new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God, and
my new name.</span></li>
<li><span>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith
to the churches.</span></li>
<li><span>And to the angel of the church of Laodicea, write: These
things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, who is the
beginning of the creation of God:</span></li>
<li><span>I know thy works, that thou art neither cold, nor hot. I
would thou wert cold, or hot.</span></li>
<li><span>But because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold, not hot,
I will begin to vomit thee out of my mouth.</span></li>
<li><span>Because thou sayest: I am rich, and made wealthy, and
have need of nothing: and knowest not, that thou art wretched, and
miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</span></li>
<li><span>I counsel thee to buy of me gold fire tried, that thou
mayest be made rich; and mayest be clothed in white garments, and
that the shame of thy nakedness may not appear; and anoint thy eyes
with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.</span></li>
<li><span>Such as I love, I rebuke and chastise. Be zealous
therefore, and do penance.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold, I stand at the gate, and knock. If any man shall
hear my voice, and open to me the door, I will come in to him, and
will sup with him, and he with me.</span></li>
<li><span>To him that shall overcome, I will give to sit with me in
my throne: as I also have overcome, and am set down with my Father
in his throne.</span></li>
<li><span>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith
to the churches.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="4">Apocalypse 4</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>After these things I looked, and behold a door was opened
in heaven, and the first voice which I heard, as it were, of a
trumpet speaking with me, said: Come up hither, and I will shew
thee the things which must be done hereafter.</span></li>
<li><span>And immediately I was in the spirit: and behold there was
a throne set in heaven, and upon the throne one
sitting.</span></li>
<li><span>And he that sat, was to the sight like the jasper and the
sardine stone; and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in
sight like unto an emerald.</span></li>
<li><span>And round about the throne were four and twenty seats;
and upon the seats, four and twenty ancients sitting, clothed in
white garments, and on their heads were crowns of gold.</span></li>
<li><span>And from the throne proceeded lightnings, and voices, and
thunders; and there were seven lamps burning before the throne,
which are the seven spirits of God.</span></li>
<li><span>And in the sight of the throne was, as it were, a sea of
glass like to crystal; and in the midst of the throne, and round
about the throne, were four living creatures, full of eyes before
and behind.</span></li>
<li><span>And the first living creature was like a lion: and the
second living creature like a calf: and the third living creature,
having the face, as it were, of a man: and the fourth living
creature was like an eagle flying.</span></li>
<li><span>And the four living creatures had each of them six wings;
and round about and within they are full of eyes. And they rested
not day and night, saying: Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who
was, and who is, and who is to come.</span></li>
<li><span>And when those living creatures gave glory, and honour,
and benediction to him that sitteth on the throne, who liveth for
ever and ever;</span></li>
<li><span>The four and twenty ancients fell down before him that
sitteth on the throne, and adored him that liveth for ever and
ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thou art worthy, O Lord our God, to receive glory, and
honour, and power: because thou hast created all things; and for
thy will they were, and have been created.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="5">Apocalypse 5</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the
throne, a book written within and without, sealed with seven
seals.</span></li>
<li><span>And I saw a strong angel, proclaiming with a loud voice:
Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals
thereof?</span></li>
<li><span>And no man was able, neither in heaven, nor on earth, nor
under the earth, to open the book, nor to look on it.</span></li>
<li><span>And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open
the book, nor to see it.</span></li>
<li><span>And one of the ancients said to me: Weep not; behold the
lion of the tribe of Juda, the root of David, hath prevailed to
open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>And I saw: and behold in the midst of the throne and of
the four living creatures, and in the midst of the ancients, a Lamb
standing as it were slain, having seven horns and seven eyes: which
are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And he came and took the book out of the right hand of
him that sat on the throne.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he had opened the book, the four living
creatures, and the four and twenty ancients fell down before the
Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of
odours, which are the prayers of saints:</span></li>
<li><span>And they sung a new canticle, saying: Thou art worthy, O
Lord, to take the book, and to open the seals thereof; because thou
wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God, in thy blood, out of every
tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation.</span></li>
<li><span>And hast made us to our God a kingdom and priests, and we
shall reign on the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round
about the throne, and the living creatures, and the ancients; and
the number of them was thousands of thousands,</span></li>
<li><span>Saying with a loud voice: The Lamb that was slain is
worthy to receive power, and divinity, and wisdom, and strength,
and honour, and glory, and benediction.</span></li>
<li><span>And every creature, which is in heaven, and on the earth,
and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are
in them: I heard all saying: To him that sitteth on the throne, and
to the Lamb, benediction, and honour, and glory, and power, for
ever and ever.</span></li>
<li><span>And the four living creatures said: Amen. And the four
and twenty ancients fell down on their faces, and adored him that
liveth for ever and ever.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="6">Apocalypse 6</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And I saw that the Lamb had opened one of the seven
seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures, as it were the
voice of thunder, saying: Come, and see.</span></li>
<li><span>And I saw: and behold a white horse, and he that sat on
him had a bow, and there was a crown given him, and he went forth
conquering that he might conquer.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the
second living creature, saying: Come, and see.</span></li>
<li><span>And there went out another horse that was red: and to him
that sat thereon, it was given that he should take peace from the
earth, and that they should kill one another, and a great sword was
given to him.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third
living creature saying: Come, and see. And behold a black horse,
and he that sat on him had a pair of scales in his
hand.</span></li>
<li><span>And I heard as it were a voice in the midst of the four
living creatures, saying: Two pounds of wheat for a penny, and
thrice two pounds of barley for a penny, and see thou hurt not the
wine and the oil.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice
of the fourth living creature, saying: Come, and see.</span></li>
<li><span>And behold a pale horse, and he that sat upon him, his
name was Death, and hell followed him. And power was given to him
over the four parts of the earth, to kill with sword, with famine,
and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the
altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and
for the testimony which they held.</span></li>
<li><span>And they cried with a loud voice, saying: How long, O
Lord (holy and true) dost thou not judge and revenge our blood on
them that dwell on the earth?</span></li>
<li><span>And white robes were given to every one of them one; and
it was said to them, that they should rest for a little time, till
their fellow servants, and their brethren, who are to be slain,
even as they, should be filled up.</span></li>
<li><span>And I saw, when he had opened the sixth seal, and behold
there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black as sackcloth
of hair: and the whole moon became as blood:</span></li>
<li><span>And the stars from heaven fell upon the earth, as the fig
tree casteth its green figs when it is shaken by a great
wind:</span></li>
<li><span>And the heaven departed as a book folded up: and every
mountain, and the islands were moved out of their
places.</span></li>
<li><span>And the kings of the earth, and the princes, and
tribunes, and the rich, and the strong, and every bondman, and
every freeman, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of
mountains:</span></li>
<li><span>And they say to the mountains and the rocks: Fall upon
us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth upon the throne
and from the wrath of the Lamb:</span></li>
<li><span>For the great day of their wrath is come, and who shall
be able to stand?</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="7">Apocalypse 7</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>After these things, I saw four angels standing on the
four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth,
that they should not blow upon the earth, nor upon the sea, nor on
any tree.</span></li>
<li><span>And I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the
sun, having the sign of the living God; and he cried with a loud
voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth
and the sea,</span></li>
<li><span>Saying: Hurt not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees,
till we sign the servants of our God in their
foreheads.</span></li>
<li><span>And I heard the number of them that were signed, an
hundred forty-four thousand were signed, of every tribe of the
children of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Of the tribe of Juda, were twelve thousand signed: Of the
tribe of Ruben, twelve thousand signed: Of the tribe of Gad, twelve
thousand signed:</span></li>
<li><span>Of the tribe of Aser, twelve thousand signed: Of the
tribe of Nephthali, twelve thousand signed: Of the tribe of
Manasses, twelve thousand signed:</span></li>
<li><span>Of the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand signed: Of the
tribe of Levi, twelve thousand signed: Of the tribe of Issachar,
twelve thousand signed:</span></li>
<li><span>Of the tribe of Zabulon, twelve thousand signed: Of the
tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand signed: Of the tribe of Benjamin,
twelve thousand signed.</span></li>
<li><span>After this I saw a great multitude, which no man could
number, of all nations, and tribes, and peoples, and tongues,
standing before the throne, and in sight of the Lamb, clothed with
white robes, and palms in their hands:</span></li>
<li><span>And they cried with a loud voice, saying: Salvation to
our God, who sitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the angels stood round about the throne, and the
ancients, and the four living creatures; and they fell down before
the throne upon their faces, and adored God,</span></li>
<li><span>Saying: Amen. Benediction, and glory, and wisdom, and
thanksgiving, honour, and power, and strength to our God for ever
and ever. Amen.</span></li>
<li><span>And one of the ancients answered, and said to me: These
that are clothed in white robes, who are they? and whence came
they?</span></li>
<li><span>And I said to him: My Lord, thou knowest. And he said to
me: These are they who are come out of great tribulation, and have
washed their robes, and have made them white in the blood of the
Lamb.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore they are before the throne of God, and they
serve him day and night in his temple: and he, that sitteth on the
throne, shall dwell over them.</span></li>
<li><span>They shall no more hunger nor thirst, neither shall the
sun fall on them, nor any heat.</span></li>
<li><span>For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall
rule them, and shall lead them to the fountains of the waters of
life, and God shall wipe away all tears from their
eyes.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="8">Apocalypse 8</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was
silence in heaven, as it were for half an hour.</span></li>
<li><span>And I saw seven angels standing in the presence of God;
and there were given to them seven trumpets.</span></li>
<li><span>And another angel came, and stood before the altar,
having a golden censer; and there was given to him much incense,
that he should offer of the prayers of all saints upon the golden
altar, which is before the throne of God.</span></li>
<li><span>And the smoke of the incense of the prayers of the saints
ascended up before God from the hand of the angel.</span></li>
<li><span>And the angel took the censer, and filled it with the
fire of the altar, and cast it on the earth, and there were
thunders and voices and lightnings, and a great
earthquake.</span></li>
<li><span>And the seven angels, who had the seven trumpets,
prepared themselves to sound the trumpet.</span></li>
<li><span>And the first angel sounded the trumpet, and there
followed hail and fire, mingled with blood, and it was cast on the
earth, and the third part of the earth was burnt up, and the third
part of the trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt
up.</span></li>
<li><span>And the second angel sounded the trumpet: and as it were
a great mountain, burning with fire, was cast into the sea, and the
third part of the sea became blood:</span></li>
<li><span>And the third part of those creatures died, which had
life in the sea, and the third part of the ships was
destroyed.</span></li>
<li><span>And the third angel sounded the trumpet, and a great star
fell from heaven, burning as it were a torch, and it fell on the
third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of
waters:</span></li>
<li><span>And the name of the star is called Wormwood. And the
third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the
waters, because they were made bitter.</span></li>
<li><span>And the fourth angel sounded the trumpet, and the third
part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and
the third part of the stars, so that the third part of them was
darkened, and the day did not shine for a third part of it, and the
night in like manner.</span></li>
<li><span>And I beheld, and heard the voice of one eagle flying
through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice: Woe, woe,
woe to the inhabitants of the earth: by reason of the rest of the
voices of the three angels, who are yet to sound the
trumpet.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">

<li><span>And the fifth angel sounded the trumpet, and I saw a star
fall from heaven upon the earth, and there was given to him the key
of the bottomless pit.</span></li>
<li><span>And he opened the bottomless pit: and the smoke of the
pit arose, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air
were darkened with the smoke of the pit.</span></li>
<li><span>And from the smoke of the pit there came out locusts upon
the earth. And power was given to them, as the scorpions of the
earth have power:</span></li>
<li><span>And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the
grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree: but only the
men who have not the sign of God on their foreheads.</span></li>
<li><span>And it was given unto them that they should not kill
them; but that they should torment them five months: and their
torment was as the torment of a scorpion when he striketh a
man.</span></li>
<li><span>And in those days men shall seek death, and shall not
find it: and they shall desire to die, and death shall fly from
them.</span></li>
<li><span>And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses
prepared unto battle: and on their heads were, as it were, crowns
like gold: and their faces were as the faces of men.</span></li>
<li><span>And they had hair as the hair of women; and their teeth
were as lions:</span></li>
<li><span>And they had breastplates as breastplates of iron, and
the noise of their wings was as the noise of chariots and many
horses running to battle.</span></li>
<li><span>And they had tails like to scorpions, and there were
stings in their tails; and their power was to hurt men five months.
And they had over them</span></li>
<li><span>A king, the angel of the bottomless pit; whose name in
Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek Apollyon; in Latin
Exterminans,</span></li>
<li><span>One woe is past, and behold there come yet two woes more
hereafter.</span></li>
<li><span>And the sixth angel sounded the trumpet: and I heard a
voice from the four horns of the great altar, which is before the
eyes of God,</span></li>
<li><span>Saying to the sixth angel, who had the trumpet: Loose the
four angels, who are bound in the great river
Euphrates.</span></li>
<li><span>And the four angels were loosed, who were prepared for an
hour, and a day, and a month, and a year: for to kill the third
part of men.</span></li>
<li><span>And the number of the army of horsemen was twenty
thousand times ten thousand. And I heard the number of
them.</span></li>
<li><span>And thus I saw the horses in the vision: and they that
sat on them, had breastplates of fire and of hyacinth and of
brimstone, and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions:
and from their mouths proceeded fire, and smoke, and
brimstone.</span></li>
<li><span>And by these three plagues was slain the third part of
men, by the fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone, which
issued out of their mouths.</span></li>
<li><span>For the power of the horses is in their mouths, and in
their tails. For, their tails are like to serpents, and have heads:
and with them they hurt.</span></li>
<li><span>And the rest of the men, who were not slain by these
plagues, did not do penance from the works of their hands, that
they should not adore devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and
brass, and stone, and wood, which neither can see, nor hear, nor
walk:</span></li>
<li><span>Neither did they penance from their murders, nor from
their sorceries, nor from their fornication, nor from their
thefts.</span></li>

<li><span>And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven,
clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow was on his head, and his face
was as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire.</span></li>
<li><span>And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his
right foot upon the sea, and his left foot upon the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roareth.
And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their
voices.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I
was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying to me:
Seal up the things which the seven thunders have spoken; and write
them not.</span></li>
<li><span>And the angel, whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon
the earth, lifted up his hand to heaven,</span></li>
<li><span>And he swore by him that liveth for ever and ever, who
created heaven, and the things which are therein; and the earth,
and the things which are in it; and the sea, and the things which
are therein: That time shall be no longer.</span></li>
<li><span>But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when
he shall begin to sound the trumpet, the mystery of God shall be
finished, as he hath declared by his servants the
prophets.</span></li>
<li><span>And I heard a voice from heaven again speaking to me, and
saying: Go, and take the book that is open, from the hand of the
angel who standeth upon the sea, and upon the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And I went to the angel, saying unto him, that he should
give me the book. And he said to me: Take the book, and eat it up:
and it shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it shall be
sweet as honey.</span></li>
<li><span>And I took the book from the hand of the angel, and ate
it up: and it was in my mouth, sweet as honey: and when I had eaten
it, my belly was bitter.</span></li>

nations, and peoples, and tongues, and kings.</span></li>

said to me: Arise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar and
them that adore therein.</span></li>
<li><span>But the court, which is without the temple, cast out, and
measure it not: because it is given unto the Gentiles, and the holy
city they shall tread under foot two and forty months:</span></li>
<li><span>And I will give unto my two witnesses, and they shall
prophesy a thousand two hundred sixty days, clothed in
sackcloth.</span></li>
<li><span>These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks,
that stand before the Lord of the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And if any man will hurt them, fire shall come out of
their mouths, and shall devour their enemies. And if any man will
hurt them, in this manner must he be slain.</span></li>
<li><span>These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the
days of their prophecy: and they have power over waters to turn
them into blood, and to strike the earth with all plagues as often
as they will.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they shall have finished their testimony, the
beast, that ascendeth out of the abyss, shall make war against
them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.</span></li>
<li><span>And their bodies shall lie in the streets of the great
city, which is called spiritually, Sodom and Egypt, where their
Lord also was crucified.</span></li>
<li><span>And they of the tribes, and peoples, and tongues, and
nations, shall see their bodies for three days and a half: and they
shall not suffer their bodies to be laid in sepulchres.</span></li>
<li><span>And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over
them, and make merry: and shall send gifts one to another, because
these two prophets tormented them that dwelt upon the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And after three days and a half, the spirit of life from
God entered into them. And they stood upon their feet, and great
fear fell upon them that saw them.</span></li>
<li><span>And they heard a great voice from heaven, saying to them:
Come up hither. And they went up to heaven in a cloud: and their
enemies saw them.</span></li>
<li><span>And at that hour there was made a great earthquake, and
the tenth part of the city fell: and there were slain in the
earthquake names of men seven thousand: and the rest were cast into
a fear, and gave glory to the God of heaven.</span></li>
<li><span>The second woe is past: and behold the third woe will
come quickly.</span></li>
<li><span>And the seventh angel sounded the trumpet: and there were
great voices in heaven, saying: The kingdom of this world is become
our Lord's and his Christ's, and he shall reign for ever and ever.
Amen.</span></li>
<li><span>And the four and twenty ancients, who sit on their seats
in the sight of God, fell on their faces and adored God,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, who art, and
who wast, and who art to come: because thou hast taken to thee thy
great power, and thou hast reigned.</span></li>
<li><span>And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and
the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou
shouldest render reward to thy servants the prophets and the
saints, and to them that fear thy name, little and great, and
shouldest destroy them who have corrupted the earth.</span></li>

<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="12">Apocalypse 12</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And a great sign appeared in heaven: A woman clothed with
the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of
twelve stars:</span></li>
<li><span>And being with child, she cried travailing in birth, and
was in pain to be delivered.</span></li>
<li><span>And there was seen another sign in heaven: and behold a
great red dragon, having seven heads, and ten horns: and on his
head seven diadems:</span></li>
<li><span>And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven,
and cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman
who was ready to be delivered; that, when she should be delivered,
he might devour her son.</span></li>
<li><span>And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all
nations with an iron rod: and her son was taken up to God, and to
his throne.</span></li>
<li><span>And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she had a
place prepared by God, that there they should feed her a thousand
two hundred sixty days.</span></li>
<li><span>And there was a great battle in heaven, Michael and his
angels fought with the dragon, and the dragon fought and his
angels:</span></li>
<li><span>And they prevailed not, neither was their place found any
more in heaven.</span></li>
<li><span>And that great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, who
is called the devil and Satan, who seduceth the whole world; and he
was cast unto the earth, and his angels were thrown down with
him.</span></li>
<li><span>And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying: Now is come
salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power
of his Christ: because the accuser of our brethren is cast forth,
who accused them before our God day and night.</span></li>
<li><span>And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by
the word of the testimony, and they loved not their lives unto
death.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and you that dwell therein.
Woe to the earth, and to the sea, because the devil is come down
unto you, having great wrath, knowing that he hath but a short
time.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth,
he persecuted the woman, who brought forth the man
child:</span></li>
<li><span>And there were given to the woman two wings of a great
eagle, that she might fly into the desert unto her place, where she
is nourished for a time and times, and half a time, from the face
of the serpent.</span></li>
<li><span>And the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman,
water as it were a river; that he might cause her to be carried
away by the river.</span></li>
<li><span>And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her
mouth, and swallowed up the river, which the dragon cast out of his
mouth.</span></li>
<li><span>And the dragon was angry against the woman: and went to
make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of
God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.</span></li>

heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten diadems, and upon his
heads names of blasphemy.</span></li>
<li><span>And the beast, which I saw, was like to a leopard, and
his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of
a lion. And the dragon gave him his own strength, and great
power.</span></li>
<li><span>And I saw one of his heads as it were slain to death: and
his death's wound was healed. And all the earth was in admiration
after the beast.</span></li>
<li><span>And they adored the dragon, which gave power to the
beast: and they adored the beast, saying: Who is like to the beast?
and who shall be able to fight with him?</span></li>
<li><span>And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things,
and blasphemies: and power was given to him to do two and forty
months.</span></li>
<li><span>And he opened his mouth unto blasphemies against God, to
blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in
heaven.</span></li>
<li><span>And it was given unto him to make war with the saints,
and to overcome them. And power was given him over every tribe, and
people, and tongue, and nation.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the dwell upon the earth adored him, whose names
are not written in the book of life of the Lamb, which was slain
from the beginning of the world.</span></li>
<li><span>If any man have an ear, let him hear.</span></li>
<li><span>He that shall lead into captivity, shall go into
captivity: he that shall kill by the sword, must be killed by the
sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the
saints.</span></li>
<li><span>And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and
he had two horns, like a lamb, and he spoke as a
dragon.</span></li>
<li><span>And he executed all the power of the former beast in his
sight; and he caused the earth, and them that dwell therein, to
adore the first beast, whose wound to death was healed.</span></li>
<li><span>And he did great signs, so that he made also fire to come
down from heaven unto the earth in the sight of men.</span></li>
<li><span>And he seduced them that dwell on the earth, for the
signs, which were given him to do in the sight of the beast, saying
to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make the image of
the beast, which had the wound by the sword, and lived.</span></li>
<li><span>And it was given him to give life to the image of the
beast, and that the image of the beast should speak; and should
cause, that whosoever will not adore the image of the beast, should
be slain.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall make all, both little and great, rich and
poor, freemen and bondmen, to have a character in their right hand,
or on their foreheads.</span></li>
<li><span>And that no man might buy or sell, but he that hath the
character, or the name of the beast, or the number of his
name.</span></li>
<li><span>Here is wisdom. He that hath understanding, let him count
the number of the beast. For it is the number of a man: and the
number of him is six hundred sixty-six.</span></li>

with him an hundred forty-four thousand, having his name, and the
name of his Father, written on their foreheads.</span></li>
<li><span>And I heard a voice from heaven, as the noise of many
waters, and as the voice of great thunder; and the voice which I
heard, was as the voice of harpers, harping on their
harps.</span></li>
<li><span>And they sung as it were a new canticle, before the
throne, and before the four living creatures, and the ancients; and
no man could say the canticle, but those hundred forty-four
thousand, who were purchased from the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>These are they who were not defiled with women: for they
are virgins. These follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These
were purchased from among men, the firstfruits to God and to the
Lamb:</span></li>
<li><span>And in their mouth there was found no lie; for they are
without spot before the throne of God.</span></li>

people:</span></li>

honour, because the hour of his judgment is come; and adore ye him,

fallen, is fallen; which made all nations to drink of the wine of
the wrath of her fornication.</span></li>

voice: If any man shall adore the beast and his image, and receive
his character in his forehead, or in his hand;</span></li>
<li><span>He also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God,
which is mingled with pure wine in the cup of his wrath, and shall
be tormented with fire and brimstone in the sight of the holy
angels, and in the sight of the Lamb.</span></li>
<li><span>And the smoke of their torments shall ascend up for ever

Blessed are the dead, who die in the Lord. From henceforth now,
saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; for their
works follow them.</span></li>
<li><span>And I saw, and behold a white cloud; and upon the cloud
one sitting like to the Son of man, having on his head a crown of
gold, and in his hand a sharp sickle.</span></li>
<li><span>And another angel came out from the temple crying with a
loud voice to him that sat upon the cloud: Thrust in thy sickle,
and reap, because the hour is come to reap: for the harvest of the
earth is ripe.</span></li>

earth, and the earth was reaped.</span></li>

over fire; and he cried with a loud voice to him that had the sharp
sickle, saying: Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters
of the vineyard of the earth; because the grapes thereof are
ripe.</span></li>
<li><span>And the angel thrust in his sharp sickle into the earth,
and gathered the vineyard of the earth, and cast it into the great
press of the wrath of God:</span></li>

came out of the press, up to the horses' bridles, for a thousand
and six hundred furlongs.</span></li>

up the wrath of God.</span></li>

and them that had overcome the beast, and his image, and the number
of his name, standing on the sea of glass, having the harps of

God upon the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the
earth, and there fell a sore and grievous wound upon men, who had
the character of the beast; and upon them that adored the image
thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea,
and there came blood as it were of a dead man; and every living
soul died in the sea.</span></li>
<li><span>And the third poured out his vial upon the rivers and the
fountains of waters; and there was made blood.</span></li>
<li><span>And I heard the angel of the waters saying: Thou art
just, O Lord, who art, and who wast, the Holy One, because thou
hast judged these things:</span></li>
<li><span>For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and
thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are
worthy.</span></li>
<li><span>And I heard another, from the altar, saying: Yea, O Lord
God Almighty, true and just are thy judgments.</span></li>
<li><span>And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun,
and it was given unto him to afflict men with heat and
fire:</span></li>
<li><span>And men were scorched with great heat, and they
blasphemed the name of God, who hath power over these plagues,
neither did they penance to give him glory.</span></li>
<li><span>And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of
the beast; and his kingdom became dark, and they gnawed their
tongues for pain:</span></li>
<li><span>And they blasphemed the God of heaven, because of their
pains and wounds, and did not penance for their works.</span></li>
<li><span>And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon that great
river Euphrates; and dried up the water thereof, that a way might
be prepared for the kings from the rising of the sun.</span></li>
<li><span>And I saw from the mouth of the dragon, and from the
mouth of the beast, and from the mouth of the false prophet, three
unclean spirits like frogs.</span></li>
<li><span>For they are the spirits of devils working signs, and
they go forth unto the kings of the whole earth, to gather them to
battle against the great day of the Almighty God.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth,
and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his
shame.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall gather them together into a place, which in
Hebrew is called Armagedon.</span></li>
<li><span>And the seventh angel poured out his vial upon the air,
and there came a great voice out of the temple from the throne,
saying: It is done.</span></li>
<li><span>And there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and
there was a great earthquake, such an one as never had been since
men were upon the earth, such an earthquake, so great.</span></li>
<li><span>And the great city was divided into three parts; and the
cities of the Gentiles fell. And great Babylon came in remembrance
before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the indignation of
his wrath.</span></li>
<li><span>And every island fled away, and the mountains were not
found.</span></li>

<li><span>And there came one of the seven angels, who had the seven
vials, and spoke with me, saying: Come, I will shew thee the
condemnation of the great harlot, who sitteth upon many
waters,</span></li>
<li><span>With whom the kings of the earth have committed
fornication; and they who inhabit the earth, have been made drunk
with the whine of her whoredom.</span></li>
<li><span>And he took me away in spirit into the desert. And I saw
a woman sitting upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of
blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.</span></li>
<li><span>And the woman was clothed round about with purple and
scarlet, and gilt with gold, and precious stones and pearls, having
a golden cup in her hand, full of the abomination and filthiness of
her fornication.</span></li>
<li><span>And on her forehead a name was written: A mystery;
Babylon the great, the mother of the fornications, and the
abominations of the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints,
and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And I wondered, when I
had seen her, with great admiration.</span></li>
<li><span>And the angel said to me: Why dost thou wonder? I will
tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast which carrieth
her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.</span></li>
<li><span>The beast, which thou sawest, was, and is not, and shall
come up out of the bottomless pit, and go into destruction: and the
inhabitants on the earth (whose names are not written in the book
of life from the foundation of the world) shall wonder, seeing the
beast that was, and is not.</span></li>
<li><span>And here is the understanding that hath wisdom. The seven
heads are seven mountains, upon which the woman sitteth, and they
are seven kings:</span></li>
<li><span>Five are fallen, one is, and the other is not yet come:
and when he is come, he must remain a short time.</span></li>
<li><span>And the beast which was, and is not: the same also is the
eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into
destruction.</span></li>
<li><span>And the ten horns which thou sawest, are ten kings, who
have not yet received a kingdom, but shall receive power as kings
one hour after the beast.</span></li>
<li><span>These have one design: and their strength and power they
shall deliver to the beast.</span></li>
<li><span>These shall fight with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall
overcome them, because he is Lord of lords, and King of kings, and
they that are with him are called, and elect, and
faithful.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to me: The waters which thou sawest, where
the harlot sitteth, are peoples, and nations, and
tongues.</span></li>
<li><span>And the ten horns which thou sawest in the beast: these
shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and naked, and
shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her with fire.</span></li>
<li><span>For God hath given into their hearts to do that which
pleaseth him: that they give their kingdom to the beast, till the
words of God be fulfilled.</span></li>
<li><span>And the woman which thou sawest, is the great city, which
hath kingdom over the kings of the earth.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="18">Apocalypse 18</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And after these things, I saw another angel come down
from heaven, having great power: and the earth was enlightened with
his glory.</span></li>
<li><span>And he cried out with a strong voice, saying: Babylon the
great is fallen, is fallen; and is become the habitation of devils,
and the hold of every unclean spirit, and the hold of every unclean
and hateful bird:</span></li>
<li><span>Because all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath
of her fornication; and the kings of the earth have committed
fornication with her; and the merchants of the earth have been made
rich by the power of her delicacies.</span></li>
<li><span>And I heard another voice from heaven, saying: Go out
from her, my people; that you be not partakers of her sins, and
that you receive not of her plagues.</span></li>
<li><span>For her sins have reached unto heaven, and the Lord hath
remembered her iniquities.</span></li>
<li><span>Render to her as she also hath rendered to you; and
double unto her double according to her works: in the cup wherein
she hath mingled, mingle ye double unto her.</span></li>
<li><span>As much as she hath glorified herself, and lived in
delicacies, so much torment and sorrow give ye to her; because she
saith in her heart: I sit a queen, and am no widow; and sorrow I
shall not see.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and
mourning, and famine, and she shall be burnt with the fire; because
God is strong, who shall judge her.</span></li>
<li><span>And the kings of the earth, who have committed
fornication, and lived in delicacies with her, shall weep, and
bewail themselves over her, when they shall see the smoke of her
burning:</span></li>
<li><span>Standing afar off for fear of her torments, saying: Alas!
alas! that great city Babylon, that mighty city: for in one hour is
thy judgment come.</span></li>
<li><span>And the merchants of the earth shall weep, and mourn over
her: for no man shall buy their merchandise any more.</span></li>
<li><span>Merchandise of gold and silver, and precious stones; and
of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and
all thyine wood, and all manner of vessels of ivory, and all manner
of vessels of precious stone, and of brass, and of iron, and of
marble,</span></li>
<li><span>And cinnamon, and odours, and ointment, and frankincense,
and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and
sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of
men.</span></li>
<li><span>And the fruits of the desire of thy soul are departed
from thee, and all fat and goodly things are perished from thee,
and they shall find them no more at all.</span></li>
<li><span>The merchants of these things, who were made rich, shall
stand afar off from her, for fear of her torments, weeping and
mourning.</span></li>
<li><span>And saying: Alas! alas! that great city, which was
clothed with fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and was gilt with
gold, and precious stones, and pearls.</span></li>
<li><span>For in one hour are so great riches come to nought; and
every shipmaster, and all that sail into the lake, and mariners,
and as many as work in the sea, stood afar off.</span></li>
<li><span>And cried, seeing the place of her burning, saying: What
city is like to this great city?</span></li>
<li><span>And they cast dust upon their heads, and cried, weeping
and mourning, saying: Alas! alas! that great city, wherein all were
made rich, that had ships at sea, by reason of her prices: for in
one hour she is made desolate.</span></li>
<li><span>Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and
prophets; for God hath judged your judgment on her.</span></li>
<li><span>And a mighty angel took up a stone, as it were a great
millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying: With such violence as
this shall Babylon, that great city, be thrown down, and shall be
found no more at all.</span></li>
<li><span>And the voice of harpers, and of musicians, and of them
that play on the pipe, and on the trumpet, shall no more be heard
at all in thee; and no craftsman of any art whatsoever shall be
found any more at all in thee; and the sound of the mill shall be
heard no more at all in thee;</span></li>
<li><span>And the light of the lamp shall shine no more at all in
thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and the bride shall be heard
no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the
earth, for all nations have been deceived by thy
enchantments.</span></li>
<li><span>And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints,
and of all that were slain upon the earth.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="19">Apocalypse 19</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>After these things I heard as it were the voice of much
people in heaven, saying: Alleluia. Salvation, and glory, and power
is to our God.</span></li>
<li><span>For true and just are his judgments, who hath judged the
great harlot which corrupted the earth with her fornication, and
hath revenged the blood of his servants, at her hands.</span></li>
<li><span>And again they said: Alleluia. And her smoke ascendeth
for ever and ever.</span></li>
<li><span>And the four and twenty ancients, and the four living
creatures fell down and adored God that sitteth upon the throne,
saying: Amen; Alleluia.</span></li>
<li><span>And a voice came out from the throne, saying: Give praise
to our God, all ye his servants; and you that fear him, little and
great.</span></li>
<li><span>And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude,
and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of great
thunders, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord our God the Almighty hath
reigned.</span></li>
<li><span>Let us be glad and rejoice, and give glory to him; for
the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath prepared
herself.</span></li>
<li><span>And it is granted to her that she should clothe herself
with fine linen, glittering and white. For the fine linen are the
justifications of saints.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to me: Write: Blessed are they that are
called to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith to me:
These words of God are true.</span></li>
<li><span>And I fell down before his feet, to adore him. And he
saith to me: See thou do it not: I am thy fellow servant, and of
thy brethren, who have the testimony of Jesus. Adore God. For the
testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</span></li>
<li><span>And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he
that sat upon him was called faithful and true, and with justice
doth he judge and fight.</span></li>
<li><span>And his eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head
were many diadems, and he had a name written, which no man knoweth
but himself.</span></li>
<li><span>And he was clothed with a garment sprinkled with blood;
and his name is called, THE WORD OF GOD.</span></li>
<li><span>And the armies that are in heaven followed him on white
horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.</span></li>
<li><span>And out of his mouth proceedeth a sharp two edged sword;
that with it he may strike the nations. And he shall rule them with
a rod of iron; and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness of
the wrath of God the Almighty.</span></li>
<li><span>And he hath on his garment, and on his thigh written:
KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.</span></li>
<li><span>And I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried with
a loud voice, saying to all the birds that did fly through the
midst of heaven: Come, gather yourselves together to the great
supper of God:</span></li>
<li><span>That you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of
tribunes, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and
of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all freemen and bondmen,
and of little and of great.</span></li>
<li><span>And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and
their armies gathered together to make war with him that sat upon
the horse, and with his army.</span></li>
<li><span>And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet,
who wrought signs before him, wherewith he seduced them who
received the character of the beast, and who adored his image.
These two were cast alive into the pool of fire, burning with
brimstone.</span></li>
<li><span>And the rest were slain by the sword of him that sitteth
upon the horse, which proceedeth out of his mouth; and all the
birds were filled with their flesh.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="20">Apocalypse 20</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And I saw an angel coming down from heaven, having the
key of the bottomless pit, and a great chain in his
hand.</span></li>
<li><span>And he laid hold on the dragon the old serpent, which is
the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand
years.</span></li>
<li><span>And he cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up,
and set a seal upon him, that he should no more seduce the nations,
till the thousand years be finished. And after that, he must be
loosed a little time.</span></li>
<li><span>And I saw seats; and they sat upon them; and judgment was
given unto them; and the souls of them that were beheaded for the
testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and who had not adored
the beast nor his image, nor received his character on their
foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with
Christ a thousand years.</span></li>
<li><span>The rest of the dead lived not, till the thousand years
were finished. This is the first resurrection.</span></li>
<li><span>Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first
resurrection. In these the second death hath no power; but they
shall be priests of God and of Christ; and shall reign with him a
thousand years.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the thousand years shall be finished, Satan
shall be loosed out of his prison, and shall go forth, and seduce
the nations, which are over the four quarters of the earth, Gog,
and Magog, and shall gather them together to battle, the number of
whom is as the sand of the sea.</span></li>
<li><span>And they came upon the breadth of the earth, and
encompassed the camp of the saints, and the beloved
city.</span></li>
<li><span>And there came down fire from God out of heaven, and
devoured them; and the devil, who seduced them, was cast into the
pool of fire and brimstone, where both the beast</span></li>
<li><span>And the false prophet shall be tormented day and night
for ever and ever.</span></li>
<li><span>And I saw a great white throne, and one sitting upon it,
from whose face the earth and heaven fled away, and there was no
place found for them.</span></li>
<li><span>And I saw the dead, great and small, standing in the
presence of the throne, and the books were opened; and another book
was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged by
those things which were written in the books, according to their
works.</span></li>
<li><span>And the sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death
and hell gave up their dead that were in them; and they were judged
every one according to their works.</span></li>
<li><span>And hell and death were cast into the pool of fire. This
is the second death.</span></li>
<li><span>And whosoever was not found written in the book of life,
was cast into the pool of fire.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="21">Apocalypse 21</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And I saw a new heaven and a new earth. For the first
heaven and the first earth was gone, and the sea is now no
more.</span></li>
<li><span>And I John saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming
down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her
husband.</span></li>
<li><span>And I heard a great voice from the throne, saying: Behold
the tabernacle of God with men, and he will dwell with them. And
they shall be his people; and God himself with them shall be their
God.</span></li>
<li><span>And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes: and
death shall be no more, nor mourning, nor crying, nor sorrow shall
be any more, for the former things are passed away.</span></li>
<li><span>And he that sat on the throne, said: Behold, I make all
things new. And he said to me: Write, for these words are most
faithful and true.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to me: It is done. I am Alpha and Omega; the
beginning and the end. To him that thirsteth, I will give of the
fountain of the water of life, freely.</span></li>
<li><span>He that shall overcome shall possess these things, and I
will be his God; and he shall be my son.</span></li>
<li><span>But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and
murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all
liars, they shall have their portion in the pool burning with fire
and brimstone, which is the second death.</span></li>
<li><span>And there came one of the seven angels, who had the vials
full of the seven last plagues, and spoke with me, saying: Come,
and I will shew thee the bride, the wife of the Lamb.</span></li>
<li><span>And he took me up in spirit to a great and high mountain:
and he shewed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven
from God,</span></li>
<li><span>Having the glory of God, and the light thereof was like
to a precious stone, as to the jasper stone, even as
crystal.</span></li>
<li><span>And it had a wall great and high, having twelve gates,
and in the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which
are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>On the east, three gates: and on the north, three gates:
and on the south, three gates: and on the west, three
gates.</span></li>
<li><span>And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in
them, the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the
Lamb.</span></li>
<li><span>And he that spoke with me, had a measure of a reed of
gold, to measure the city and the gates thereof, and the
wall.</span></li>
<li><span>And the city lieth in a foursquare, and the length
thereof is as great as the breadth: and he measured the city with
the golden reed for twelve thousand furlongs, and the length and
the height and the breadth thereof are equal.</span></li>
<li><span>And he measured the wall thereof an hundred and
forty-four cubits, the measure of a man, which is of an
angel.</span></li>
<li><span>And the building of the wall thereof was of jasper stone:
but the city itself pure gold, like to clear glass.</span></li>
<li><span>And the foundations of the wall of the city were adorned
with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was
jasper: the second, sapphire: the third, a chalcedony: the fourth,
an emerald:</span></li>
<li><span>The fifth, sardonyx: the sixth, sardius: the seventh,
chrysolite: the eighth, beryl: the ninth, a topaz: the tenth, a
chrysoprasus: the eleventh, a jacinth: the twelfth, an
amethyst.</span></li>
<li><span>And the twelve gates are twelve pearls, one to each: and
every several gate was of one several pearl. And the street of the
city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.</span></li>
<li><span>And I saw no temple therein. For the Lord God Almighty is
the temple thereof, and the Lamb.</span></li>
<li><span>And the city hath no need of the sun, nor of the moon, to
shine in it. For the glory of God hath enlightened it, and the Lamb
is the lamp thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>And the nations shall walk in the light of it: and the
kings of the earth shall bring their glory and honour into
it.</span></li>
<li><span>And the gates thereof shall not be shut by day: for there
shall be no night there.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations
into it.</span></li>
<li><span>There shall not enter into it any thing defiled, or that
worketh abomination or maketh a lie, but they that are written in
the book of life of the Lamb.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="22">Apocalypse 22</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And he showed me a river of water of life, clear as
crystal, proceeding from the throne of God and of the
Lamb.</span></li>
<li><span>In the midst of the street thereof, and on both sides of
the river, was the tree of life, bearing twelve fruits, yielding
its fruits every month, and the leaves of the tree were for the
healing of the nations.</span></li>
<li><span>And there shall be no curse any more; but the throne of
God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and his servants shall serve
him.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall see his face: and his name shall be on
their foreheads.</span></li>
<li><span>And night shall be no more: and they shall not need the
light of the lamp, nor the light of the sun, because the Lord God
shall enlighten them, and they shall reign for ever and
ever.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to me: These words are most faithful and
true. And the Lord God of the spirits of the prophets sent his
angel to shew his servants the things which must be done
shortly.</span></li>
<li><span>And, Behold I come quickly. Blessed is he that keepeth
the words of the prophecy of this book.</span></li>
<li><span>And I, John, who have heard and seen these things. And
after I had heard and seen, I fell down to adore before the feet of
the angel, who shewed me these things.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to me: See thou do it not: for I am thy
fellow servant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them that
keep the words of the prophecy of this book. Adore God.</span></li>
<li><span>And he saith to me: Seal not the words of the prophecy of
this book: for the time is at hand.</span></li>
<li><span>He that hurteth, let him hurt still: and he that is
filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is just, let him be
justified still: and he that is holy, let him be sanctified
still.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to
render to every man according to his works.</span></li>
<li><span>I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last, the
beginning and the end.</span></li>
<li><span>Blessed are they that wash their robes in the blood of
the Lamb: that they may have a right to the tree of life, and may
enter in by the gates into the city.</span></li>
<li><span>Without are dogs, and sorcerers, and unchaste, and
murderers, and servers of idols, and every one that loveth and
maketh a lie.</span></li>
<li><span>I Jesus have sent my angel, to testify to you these
things in the churches. I am the root and stock of David, the
bright and morning star.</span></li>
<li><span>And the spirit and the bride say: Come. And he that
heareth, let him say: Come. And he that thirsteth, let him come:
and he that will, let him take the water of life,
freely.</span></li>
<li><span>For I testify to every one that heareth the words of the
prophecy of this book: If any man shall add to these things, God
shall add unto him the plagues written in this book.</span></li>
<li><span>And if any man shall take away from the words of the book
of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of
life, and out of the holy city, and from these things that are
written in this book.</span></li>
<li><span>He that giveth testimony of these things, saith, Surely I
come quickly: Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.</span></li>
<li><span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
Amen.</span></li>
