<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="1">Deuteronomy 1</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>These are the words, which Moses spoke to all Israel
beyond the Jordan, in the plain wilderness, over against the Red
Sea, between Pharan and Thophel and Laban and Haseroth, where there
is very much gold:</span></li>
<li><span>Eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir
to Cadesbarne.</span></li>
<li><span>In the fortieth year, the eleventh month, the first day
of the month, Moses spoke to the children of Israel all that the
Lord had commanded him to say to them:</span></li>
<li><span>After that he had slain Sehon king of the Amorrhites, who
dwelt in Hesebon: and Og king of Basan who abode in Astaroth, and
in Edrai,</span></li>
<li><span>4l And you answered me: We have sinned against the Lord:
we will go up and fight, as the Lord our God hath commanded. And
when you went ready armed unto the mountain,</span></li>
<li><span>Beyond the Jordan in the land of Moab. And Moses began to
expound the law, and to say:</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying: You have
stayed long enough in this mountain:</span></li>
<li><span>Turn you, and come to the mountain of the Amorrhites, and
to the other places that are next to it, the plains and the hills
and the vales towards the south, and by the sea shore, the land of
the Chanaanites, and of Libanus, as far as the great river
Euphrates.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold, said he, I have delivered it to you: go in and
possess it, concerning which the Lord swore to your fathers
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that he would give it to them, and to
their seed after them.</span></li>
<li><span>And I said to you at that time:</span></li>
<li><span>I alone am not able to bear you: for the Lord your God
hath multiplied you, and you are this day as the stars of heaven,
for multitude.</span></li>
<li><span>(The Lord God of your fathers add to this number many
thousands, and bless you as he hath spoken.)</span></li>
<li><span>I alone am not able to bear your business, and the charge
of you and your differences.</span></li>
<li><span>Let me have from among you wise and understanding men,
and such whose conversation is approved among your tribes, that I
may appoint them your rulers.</span></li>
<li><span>Then you answered me: The thing is good which thou
meanest to do.</span></li>
<li><span>And I took out of your tribes men wise and honourable,
and appointed them rulers, tribunes, and centurions, and officers
over fifties, and over tens, who might teach you all
things.</span></li>
<li><span>And I commanded them, saying: Hear them, and judge that
which is just: whether he be one of your country, or a
stranger.</span></li>
<li><span>There shall be no difference of persons, you shall hear
the little as well as the great: neither shall you respect any
man's person, because it is the judgment of God. And if any thing
seem hard to you, refer it to me, and I will hear it.</span></li>
<li><span>And I commanded you all things that you were to
do.</span></li>
<li><span>And departing from Horeb, we passed through the terrible
and vast wilderness, which you saw, by the way of the mountain of
the Amorrhite, as the Lord our God had commanded us. And when we
were come into Cadesbarne,</span></li>
<li><span>I said to you: You are come to the mountain of the
Amorrhite, which the Lord our God will give to us.</span></li>
<li><span>See the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee: go up
and possess it, as the Lord our God hath spoken to thy fathers:
fear not, nor be any way discouraged.</span></li>
<li><span>And you came all to me, and said: Let us send men who may
view the land, and bring us word what way we shall go up, and to
what cities we shall go.</span></li>
<li><span>And because the saying pleased me, I sent of you twelve
men, one of every tribe:</span></li>
<li><span>Who, when they had set forward and had gone up to the
mountains, came as far as the valley of the cluster: and having
viewed the land,</span></li>
<li><span>Taking of the fruits thereof, to shew its fertility, they
brought them to us, and said: The land is good, which the Lord our
God will give us.</span></li>
<li><span>And you would not go up, but being incredulous to the
word of the Lord our God,</span></li>
<li><span>You murmured in your tents, and said: The Lord hateth us,
and therefore he hath brought us out of the land of Egypt, that he
might deliver us into the hand of the Amorrhite, and destroy
us.</span></li>
<li><span>Whither shall we go up? the messengers have terrified our
hearts, saying: The multitude is very great, and taller than we:
the cities are great, and walled up td the sky, we have seen the
sons of the Enacims there.</span></li>
<li><span>And I said to you: Fear not, neither be ye afraid of
them:</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord God, who is your leader, himself will fight for
you, as he did in Egypt in the sight of all.</span></li>
<li><span>And in the wilderness (as thou hast seen) the Lord thy
God hath carried thee, as a man is wont to carry his little son,
all the way that you have come, until you came to this
place.</span></li>
<li><span>And yet for all this you did not believe the Lord your
God,</span></li>
<li><span>Who went before you in the way, and marked out the place,
wherein you should pitch your tents, in the night shewing you the
way by fire, and in the day by the pillar of a cloud.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the Lord had heard the voice of your words, he
was angry and swore, and said:</span></li>
<li><span>Not one of the men of this wicked generation shall see
the good land, which I promised with an oath to your
fathers:</span></li>
<li><span>Except Caleb the son of Jephone: for he shall see it, and
to him I will give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his
children, because he hath followed the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Neither is his indignation against the people to be
wondered at, since the Lord was angry with me also on your account,
and said: Neither shalt thou go in thither.</span></li>
<li><span>But Josue the son of Nun, thy minister, he shall go in
for thee: exhort and encourage him, and he shall divide the land by
lot to Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Your children, of whom you said that they should be led
away captives, and your sons who know not this day the difference
of good and evil, they shall go in: and to them I will give the
land, and they shall possess it.</span></li>
<li><span>But return you and go into the wilderness by the way of
the Red Sea.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord said to me: Say to them: Go not up, and fight
not, for I am not with you: lest you fall before your
enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>I spoke, and you hearkened not: but resisting the
commandment of the Lord, and swelling with pride, you went up into
the mountain.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Amorrhite that dwelt in the mountains coming out,
and meeting you, chased you, as bees do: and made slaughter of you
from Seir as far as Horma.</span></li>
<li><span>And when you returned and wept before the Lord, he heard
you not, neither would he yield to ;your voice.</span></li>
<li><span>So you abode in Cadesbarne a long time.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="2">Deuteronomy 2</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And departing from thence we came into the wilderness
that leadeth to the Red Sea, as the Lord had spoken to me: and we
compassed mount Seir a long time.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to me:</span></li>
<li><span>You have compassed this mountain long enough: go toward
the north:</span></li>
<li><span>And command thou the people, saying: You shall pass by
the borders of your brethren the children of Esau, who dwell in
Seir, and they will be afraid of you.</span></li>
<li><span>Take ye then good heed that you stir not against them.
For I will not give you of their land so much as the step of one
foot can tread upon, because I have given mount Seir to Esau, for a
possession.</span></li>
<li><span>You shall buy meats of them for money and shall eat: you
shall draw waters for money, and shall drink.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord thy God hath blessed thee in every work of thy
hands: the Lord thy God dwelling with thee, knoweth thy journey,
how thou hast passed through this great wilderness, for forty
years, and thou hast wanted nothing.</span></li>
<li><span>And when we had passed by our brethren the children of
Esau, that dwelt in Seir, by the way of the plain from Elath and
from Asiongaber, we came to the way that leadeth to the desert of
Moab.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to me: Fight not against the Moabites,
neither go to battle against them: for I will not give thee any of
their land, because I have given Ar to the children of Lot in
possession.</span></li>
<li><span>The Emims first were the inhabitants thereof, a people
great, and strong, and so tall, that like the race of the
Enacims,</span></li>
<li><span>They were esteemed as giants, and were like the sons of
the Enacims. But the Moabites call them Emims.</span></li>
<li><span>The Horrhites also formerly dwelt in Seir: who being
driven out and destroyed, the children of Esau dwelt there, as
Israel did in the land of his possession, which the Lord gave
him.</span></li>
<li><span>Then rising up to pass the torrent Zared, we came to
it.</span></li>
<li><span>And the time that we journeyed from Cadesbarne till we
passed over the torrent Zared, was thirty-eight years: until all
the generation of the men that were fit for war was consumed out of
the camp, as the Lord had sworn:</span></li>
<li><span>For his hand was against them, that they should perish
from the midst of the camp.</span></li>
<li><span>And after all the fighting men were dead,</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord spoke to me, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt pass this day the borders of Moab, the city
named Ar:</span></li>
<li><span>And when thou comest nigh the frontiers of the children
of Ammon, take heed thou fight not against them, nor once move to
battle: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of
Ammon, because I have given it to the children of Lot for a
possession.</span></li>
<li><span>It was accounted a land of giants: and giants formerly
dwelt in it, whom the Ammonites call Zomzommims,</span></li>
<li><span>A people great and many, and of tall stature, like the
Enacims whom the Lord destroyed before their face: and he made them
to dwell in their stead,</span></li>
<li><span>As he had done in favour of the children of Esau, that
dwell in Seir, destroying the Horrhites, and delivering their land
to them, which they possess to this day.</span></li>
<li><span>The Hevites also, that dwelt in Haserim as far as Gaza,
were expelled by the Cappadocians: who came out of Cappadocia, and
destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.</span></li>
<li><span>Arise ye, and pass the torrent Arnon: Behold I have
delivered into thy hand Sehon king of Hesebon the Amorrhite, and
begin thou to possess his land and make war against
him.</span></li>
<li><span>This day will I begin to send the dread and fear of thee
upon the nations that dwell under the whole heaven: that when they
hear thy name they may fear and tremble, and be in pain like women
in travail.</span></li>
<li><span>So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Cademoth to
Sehon the king of Hesebon with peaceable words, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>We will pass through thy land, we will go along by the
highway: we will not turn aside neither to the right hand nor to
the left.</span></li>
<li><span>Sell us meat for money, that we may eat: give us water
for money and so we will drink. We only ask that thou wilt let us
pass through,</span></li>
<li><span>As the children of Esau have done, that dwell in Seir,
and the Moabites, that abide in Ar: until we come to the Jordan,
and pass to the land which the Lord our God will give
us.</span></li>
<li><span>And Sehon the king of Hesebon would not let us pass:
because the Lord thy God had hardened his spirit, and fixed his
heart, that he might be delivered into thy hands, as now thou
seest.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to me: Behold I have begun to deliver
unto thee Sehon and his land, begin to possess it.</span></li>
<li><span>And Sehon came out to meet us with all his people to
fight at Jasa.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord our God delivered him to us: and we slew him
with his sons and all his people.</span></li>
<li><span>And we took all his cities at that time, killing the
inhabitants of them, men and women and children. We left nothing of
them:</span></li>
<li><span>Except the cattle which came to the share of them that
took them: and the spoils of the cities, which we took:</span></li>
<li><span>From Aroer, which is upon the bank of the torrent Amen, a
town that is situate in a valley, as far as Galaad. There was not a
village or city, that escaped our hands: the Lord our God delivered
all unto us:</span></li>
<li><span>Except the land of the children of Ammon, to which we
approached not: and all that border upon the torrent Jeboc, and the
cities in the mountains, and all the places which the Lord our God
forbade us.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="3">Deuteronomy 3</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Then we turned and went by the way of Basan: and Og the
king of Basan came out to meet us with his people to fight in
Edrai.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to me: Fear him not: because he is
delivered into thy hand, with all his people and his land: and thou
shalt do to him as thou hast done to Sehon king of the Amorrhites,
that dwelt in Hesebon.</span></li>
<li><span>So the Lord our God delivered into our hands, Og also the
king of Basan, and all his people: and we utterly destroyed
them,</span></li>
<li><span>Wasting all his cities at one time, there was not a town
that escaped us: sixty cities, all the country of Argob the kingdom
of Og in Basan.</span></li>
<li><span>All the cities were fenced with very high walls, and with
gates and bars, be- sides innumerable towns that had no
walls.</span></li>
<li><span>And we utterly destroyed them, as we had done to Sehon
the king of Hesebon, destroying every city, men and women and
children:</span></li>
<li><span>But the cattle and the spoils of the cities we took for
our prey.</span></li>
<li><span>And we took at that time the land out of the hand of the
two kings of the Amorrhites, that were beyond the Jordan: from the
torrent Amen unto the mount Hermon,</span></li>
<li><span>Which the Sidonians call Sarion, and the Amorrhites
Sanir:</span></li>
<li><span>All the cities that are situate in the plain, and all the
land of Galaad and Basan as far as Selcha and Edrai, cities of the
kingdom of Og in Basan.</span></li>
<li><span>For only Og king of Basan remained of the race of the
giants. His bed of iron is shewn, which is in Rabbath of the
children of Ammon, being nine cubits long, and four broad after the
measure of the cubit of a man's hand.</span></li>
<li><span>And we possessed the land at that time from Aroer, which
is upon the bank of the torrent Amen, unto the half of mount
Galaad: and I gave the cities thereof to Ruben and Gad.</span></li>
<li><span>And I delivered the other part of Galaad, and all Basan
the kingdom of Og to the half tribe of Manasses, all the country of
Argob: and all Basan is called the Land of giants.</span></li>
<li><span>Jair the son of Manasses possessed all the country of d
Argob unto the borders of Gessuri, and Machati. And he called Basan
by his own name, Havoth Jair, that is to say, the towns of Jair,
until this present day.</span></li>
<li><span>To Machir also I gave Galaad.</span></li>
<li><span>And to the tribes of Ruben and Cad I gave of the land of
Galaad as far as the torrent Amen, half the torrent, and the
confines even unto the torrent Jeboc, which is the border of the
children of Ammon:</span></li>
<li><span>And the plain of the wilderness, and the Jordan, and the
borders of Cenereth unto the sea of the desert, which is the most
salt sea, to the foot of mount Phasga eastward.</span></li>
<li><span>And I commanded you at that time, saying: The Lord your
God giveth you this land for an inheritance, go ye well appointed
before your brethren the children of Israel, all the strong men of
you,</span></li>
<li><span>Leaving your wives and children and cattle. For I know
you have much cattle, and they must remain in the cities, which I
have delivered to you.</span></li>
<li><span>Until the Lord give rest to your brethren, as he hath
given to you: and they also possess the land, which he will give
them beyond the Jordan: then shall every man return to his
possession, which I have given you.</span></li>
<li><span>I commanded Josue also at that time, saying: Thy eyes
have seen what the Lord your God hath done to these two kings: so
will he do to all the king- dome to which thou shalt
pass.</span></li>
<li><span>Fear them not: for the Lord your God will fight for
you.</span></li>
<li><span>And I besought the Lord at that time, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Lord God, thou hast begun to shew unto thy servant thy
greatness, and most mighty hand, for there is no other God either
in heaven or earth, that is able to do thy works, or to be compared
to thy strength.</span></li>
<li><span>I will pass over therefore, and will see this excellent
land beyond the Jordan, and this goodly mountain, and
Libanus.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord was angry with me on your account and heard
me not, but said to me: It is enough: speak no more to me of this
matter.</span></li>
<li><span>Go up to the top of Phasga, and cast thy eyes round about
to the west, and to the north, and to the south, and to the east,
and behold it, for thou shalt not pass this Jordan.</span></li>
<li><span>Command Josue, and encourage and strengthen him: for he
shall go before this people, and shall divide unto them the land
which thou shalt see.</span></li>
<li><span>And we abode in the valley over against the temple of
Phogor.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="4">Deuteronomy 4</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And now, O Israel, hear the commandments and judgments
which I teach thee: that doing them, thou mayst live, and entering
in mayst possess the land which the Lord the God of your fathers
will give you.</span></li>
<li><span>You shall not add to the word that I speak to you,
neither shall you take away from it: keep the commandments of the
Lord your God which I command you.</span></li>
<li><span>Your eyes have seen all that the Lord hath done against
Beelphegor, how he hath destroyed all his worshippers from among
you.</span></li>
<li><span>But you that adhere to the Lord your Cad, are all alive
until this present day.</span></li>
<li><span>You know that I have taught you statutes and justices, as
the Lord my God hath commanded me: so shall you do them in the land
which you shall possess:</span></li>
<li><span>And you shall observe, and fulfil them in practice. For
this is your wisdom, and understanding in the sight of nations,
that hearing all these precepts, they may say: Behold a wise and
understanding people, a great nation.</span></li>
<li><span>Neither is there any other nation so great, that hath
gods so nigh them, as our God is present to all our
petitions.</span></li>
<li><span>For what other nation is there so renowned that hath
ceremonies, and just judgments, and all the law, which I will set
forth this day before your eyes?</span></li>
<li><span>Keep thyself therefore, and thy soul carefully. Forget
not the words that thy eyes have seen, and let them not go out of
thy heart all the days of thy life. Thou shalt teach them to thy
sons and to thy grandsons,</span></li>
<li><span>From the day in which thou didst stand before the Lord
thy God in Horeb, when the Lord spoke to me, saying: Call together
the people unto me, that they may hear my words, and may learn to
fear me all the time that they live on the earth, and may teach
their children.</span></li>
<li><span>And you came to the foot of the mount, which burned even
unto heaven: and there was darkness, and a cloud and obscurity in
it.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to you from the midst of the fire. You
heard the voice of his words, but you saw not any form at
all.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shewed you his covenant, which he commanded you to
do, and the ten words that he wrote in two tables of
stone.</span></li>
<li><span>And he commanded me at that time that I should teach you
the ceremonies and judgments which you shall do in the land, that
you shall possess.</span></li>
<li><span>Keep therefore your souls carefully. You saw not any
similitude in the day that the Lord God spoke to you in Horeb from
the midst of the fire:</span></li>
<li><span>Lest perhaps being deceived you might make you a graven
similitude, or image of male or female,</span></li>
<li><span>The similitude of any beasts, that are upon the earth, or
of birds, that fly under heaven,</span></li>
<li><span>Or of creeping things, that move on the earth, or of
fishes, that abide in the waters under the earth:</span></li>
<li><span>Lest perhaps lifting up thy eyes to heaven, thou see the
sun and the moon, and all the stars of heaven, and being deceived
by error thou adore and serve them, which the Lord thy God created
for the service of all the nations, that are under
heaven.</span></li>
<li><span>But the Lord hath taken you and brought you out of the
iron furnace of Egypt, to make you his people of inheritance, as it
is this present day.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord was angry with me for your words, and he
swore that I should not pass over the Jordan, nor enter into the
excellent land, which he will give you.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I die in this land, I shall not pass over the
Jordan: you shall pass, and possess the goodly land.</span></li>
<li><span>Beware lest thou ever forget the covenant of the Lord thy
God, which he hath made with thee: and make to thyself a graven
likeness of those things which the Lord hath forbid to be
made:</span></li>
<li><span>Because the Lord thy God is a consuming fire, a jealous
God.</span></li>
<li><span>If you shall beget sons and grandsons, and abide in the
land, and being deceived, make to yourselves any similitude,
committing evil before the Lord your God, to provoke him to
wrath:</span></li>
<li><span>I call this day heaven and earth to witness, that you
shall quickly perish out of the land, which, when you have passed
over the Jordan, you shall possess. You shall not dwell therein
long, but the Lord will destroy you,</span></li>
<li><span>And scatter you among all nations, and you shall remain a
few among the nations, to which the Lord shall lead
you.</span></li>
<li><span>And there you shah serve gods, that were framed with
men's hands: wood and stone, that neither see, nor hear, nor eat,
nor smell.</span></li>
<li><span>And when thou shalt seek there the Lord thy God, thou
shalt find him: yet so, if thou seek him with all thy heart, and
all the affliction of thy soul.</span></li>
<li><span>After all the things aforesaid shall and thee, in the
latter time thou shalt return to the Lord thy God, and shalt hear
his voice.</span></li>
<li><span>Because the Lord thy God is a merciful God: he will not
leave thee, nor altogether destroy thee, nor forget the covenant,
by which he swore to thy fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>Ask of the days of old, that have been before thy time
from the day that God created man upon the earth, from one end of
heaven to the other end thereof, if ever there was done the like
thing, or it hath been known at any time,</span></li>
<li><span>That a people should hear the voice of God speaking out
of the midst of fire, as thou hast heard, and lived:</span></li>
<li><span>If God ever did so as to go, and take to himself a nation
out of the midst of nations by temptations, signs, and wonders, by
fight, and a strong hand, and stretched out arm, and horrible
visions according to all the things that the Lord your God did for
you in Egypt, before thy eyes.</span></li>
<li><span>That thou mightest know that the Lord he is God, and
there is no other besides him.</span></li>
<li><span>From heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might
teach thee. And upon earth he shewed thee his exceeding great fire,
and thou didst hear his words out of the midst of the
fire,</span></li>
<li><span>Because he loved thy fathers, and chose their seed after
them. And he brought thee out of Egypt, going before thee with his
great power,</span></li>
<li><span>To destroy at thy coming very great nations, and stronger
than thou art, and to bring thee in, and give thee their land for a
possession, as thou seest at this present day.</span></li>
<li><span>Know therefore this day, and think in thy heart that the
Lord he is God in heaven above, and in the earth beneath, and there
is no other.</span></li>
<li><span>Keep his precepts and commandments, which I command thee:
that it may be well with thee, and thy children after thee, and
thou mayst remain a long time upon the land, which the Lord thy God
will give thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Moses set aside three cities beyond the Jordan at
the east side,</span></li>
<li><span>That any one might flee to them who should kill his
neighbour unwillingly, and was not his enemy a day or two before,
and that he might escape to some one of these cities:</span></li>
<li><span>Bosor in the wilderness, which is situate in the plains
of the tribe of Ruben: and Ramoth in Galaad, which is in the tribe
of Gad: and Golan in Basan, which is in the tribe of
Manasses.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the law, that Moses set before the children of
Israel,</span></li>
<li><span>And these are the testimonies and ceremonies and
judgments, which he spoke to the children of Israel, when they came
out of Egypt,</span></li>
<li><span>Beyond the Jordan in the valley over against the temple
of Phogor, in the land of Sehon king of the Amorrhites, that dwelt
in Hesebon, whom Moses slew. And the children of Israel coming out
of Egypt,</span></li>
<li><span>Possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Basan, of
the two kings of the Amorrhites, who were beyond the Jordan towards
the rising of the sun:</span></li>
<li><span>From Aroer, which is situate upon the bank of the torrent
Amen, unto mount Sion, which is also called Hermon,</span></li>
<li><span>All the plain beyond the Jordan at the east side, unto
the see of the wilderness, and unto the foot of mount
Phasga.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="5">Deuteronomy 5</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And Moses called all Israel, and said to them: Hear, O
Israel, the ceremonies and judgments, which I speak in your ears
this day: learn them, and fulfil them in work.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord our God made a covenant with us in
Horeb.</span></li>
<li><span>He made not the covenant with our fathers, but with us,
who are now present and living.</span></li>
<li><span>He spoke to us face to face in the mount out of the midst
of fire.</span></li>
<li><span>I was the mediator and stood between the Lord and you at
that time, to shew you his words, for you feared the fire, and went
not up into the mountain, and he said:</span></li>
<li><span>I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land
of Egypt, out of the house of bondage</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt not have strange gods in my sight.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt not make to thyself a graven thing, nor the
likeness of any things, that are in heaven above, or that are in
the earth beneath, or that abide in the waters under the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt not adore them, and thou shalt not serve them.
For I am the Lord thy God, a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of
the fathers upon their children unto the third and fourth
generation, to them that hate me,</span></li>
<li><span>And shewing mercy unto many thousands, to them that love
me, and keep my commandments.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain:
for he shall not be unpunished that taketh his name upon a vain
thing.</span></li>
<li><span>Observe the day of the sabbath, to sanctify it, as the
Lord thy God hath commanded thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Six days shalt thou labour, and shalt do all thy
works.</span></li>
<li><span>The seventh is the day of the sabbath, that is, the rest
of the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not do any work therein, thou nor
thy son nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant nor thy maidservant,
nor thy ox, nor thy ass, nor any of thy beasts, nor the stranger
that is within thy gates: that thy manservant and thy maidservant
may rest, even as thyself.</span></li>
<li><span>Remember that thou also didst serve in Egypt, and the
Lord thy God brought thee out from thence with a strong hand, and a
stretched out arm. Therefore hath he commanded thee that thou
shouldst observe the sabbath day.</span></li>
<li><span>Honour thy father and mother, as the Lord thy God hath
commanded thee, that thou mayst live a long time, and it may be
well with thee in the land, which the Lord thy God will give
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt not kill.</span></li>
<li><span>Neither shalt thou commit adultery.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt not steal.</span></li>
<li><span>Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy
neighbour.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife: nor his house,
nor his field, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox,
nor his ass, nor any thing that is his.</span></li>
<li><span>These words the Lord spoke to all the multitude of you in
the mountain, out of the midst of the fire and the cloud, and the
darkness, with a loud voice, adding nothing more: and he wrote them
in two tables of stone, which he delivered unto me.</span></li>
<li><span>But you, after you heard the voice out of the midst of
the darkness, and saw the mountain burn, came to me, all the
princes of the tribes and the elders, and you said:</span></li>
<li><span>Behold the Lord our God hath shewn us his majesty and his
greatness, we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire,
and have proved this day that God speaking with man, man hath
lived.</span></li>
<li><span>Why shall we die therefore, and why shall this exceeding
great Are consume us: for if we hear the voice of the Lord our God
any more, we shall die.</span></li>
<li><span>What is all flesh, that it should hear the voice of the
living God, who speaketh out of the midst of the fire, as we have
heard, and be able to live?</span></li>
<li><span>Approach thou rather: and hear all things that the Lord
our God shall say to thee, and thou shalt speak to us, and we will
hear and will do them.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the Lord had heard this, he said to me: I have
heard the voice of the words of this people, which they spoke to
thee: they have spoken all things well.</span></li>
<li><span>Who shall give them to have such a mind, to fear me, and
to keep all my commandments at all times, that it may be well with
them and with their children for ever?</span></li>
<li><span>Go and say to them: Return into your tents.</span></li>
<li><span>But stand thou here with me, and I will speak to thee all
my commandments, and ceremonies and judgments: which thou shalt
teach them, that they may do them in the land, which I will give
them for a possession.</span></li>
<li><span>Keep therefore and do the things which the Lord God hath
commanded you: you shall not go aside neither to the right hand,
nor to the left.</span></li>
<li><span>But you shall walk in the way that the Lord your God hath
commanded, that you may live, and it may be well with you, and your
days may be long in the land of your possession.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="6">Deuteronomy 6</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>These are the precepts, and ceremonies, and judgments,
which the Lord your God commanded that I should teach you, and that
you should do them in the land into which you pass over to possess
it:</span></li>
<li><span>That thou mayst fear the Lord thy God, and keep all his
commandments and precepts, which I command thee, and thy sons, and
thy grandsons, all the days of thy life, that thy days may be
prolonged.</span></li>
<li><span>Hear, O Israel, and observe to do the things which the
Lord hath commanded thee, that it may be well with thee, and thou
mayst be greatly multiplied, as the Lord the God of thy fathers
hath promised thee a land flowing with milk and honey.</span></li>
<li><span>Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart,
and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole strength.</span></li>
<li><span>And these words which I command thee this day, shall be
in thy heart:</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt tell them to thy children, and thou shalt
meditate upon them sitting in thy house, and walking on thy
journey, sleeping and rising.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt bind them as a sign on thy hand, and they
shall be and shall move between thy eyes.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt write them in the entry, and on the doors
of thy house.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into
the land, for which he swore to thy fathers Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob: and shall have given thee great and goodly cities, which
thou didst not build,</span></li>
<li><span>Houses full of riches, which thou didst not set up,
cisterns which thou didst not dig, vineyards and oliveyards, which
thou didst not plant,</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt have eaten and be full:</span></li>
<li><span>Take heed diligently lest thou forget the Lord, who
brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and shalt serve him only, and
thou shalt swear by his name.</span></li>
<li><span>You shall not go after the strange gods of all the
nations, that are round about you:</span></li>
<li><span>Because the Lord thy God is a jealous God in the midst of
thee: lest at any time the wrath of the Lord thy God be kindled
against thee, and take thee away from the face of the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God, as thou temptedst
him in the place of temptation.</span></li>
<li><span>Keep the precepts of the Lord thy God, and the
testimonies and ceremonies which he hath commanded
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And do that which is pleasing and good in the sight of
the Lord, that it may be well with thee: and going in thou mayst
possess the goodly land, concerning which the Lord swore to thy
fathers,</span></li>
<li><span>That he would destroy all thy enemies before thee, as he
hath spoken.</span></li>
<li><span>And when thy son shall ask thee to morrow, saying: What
mean these testimonies, and ceremonies and judgments, which the
Lord our God hath commanded us?</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt say to him: We were bondmen of Pharao in
Egypt, and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a strong
hand.</span></li>
<li><span>And he wrought signs and wonders great and very grievous
in Egypt against Pharao, and all his house, in our
sight,</span></li>
<li><span>And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us
in and give us the land, concerning which he swore to our
fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord commanded that we should do all these
ordinances, and should fear the Lord our God, that it might be well
with us all the days of our life, as it is at this day.</span></li>

precepts before the Lord our God, as he hath commanded
us.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="7">Deuteronomy 7</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>When the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the
land, which thou art going in to possess, and shall have destroyed
many nations before thee, the Hethite, and the Gergezite, and the
Amorrhite, and the Chanaanite, and the Pherezite, and the Hevite,
and the Jebusite, seven nations much more numerous than thou art,
and stronger than thou:</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord thy God shall have delivered them to thee,
thou shalt utterly destroy them. Thou shalt make no league with
them, nor shew mercy to them:</span></li>
<li><span>Neither shalt thou make marriages with them. Thou shalt
not give thy daughter to his son, nor take his daughter for thy
son:</span></li>
<li><span>For she will turn away thy son from following me, that he
may rather serve strange gods, and the wrath of the Lord will be
kindled, and will quickly destroy thee.</span></li>
<li><span>But thus rather shall you deal with them: Destroy their
altars, and break their statues, and cut down their groves, and
burn their graven things.</span></li>
<li><span>Because thou art a holy people to the Lord thy God. The
Lord thy God hath chosen thee, to be his peculiar people of all
peoples that are upon the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>Not because you surpass all nations in number, is the
Lord joined unto you, and hath chosen you, for you are the fewest
of any people:</span></li>
<li><span>But because the Lord hath loved you, and hath kept his
oath, which he swore to your fathers: and hath brought you out with
a strong hand, and redeemed you from the house of bondage, out of
the hand of Pharao the king of Egypt.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt know that the Lord thy God, he is a strong
and faithful God, keeping his covenant and mercy to them that love
him, and to them that keep his commandments, unto a thousand
generations:</span></li>
<li><span>And repaying forthwith them that hate him, so as to
destroy them, without further delay immediately rendering to them
what they deserve.</span></li>
<li><span>11Keep therefore the precepts and ceremonies and
judgments, which I command thee this day to do.</span></li>
<li><span>If after thou hast heard these judgments, thou keep and
do them, the Lord thy God will also keep his covenant to thee, and
the mercy which he swore to thy fathers:</span></li>
<li><span>And he will love thee and multiply thee, and will bless
the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy
vintage, thy oil, and thy herds, and the flocks of thy sheep upon
the land, for which he swore to thy fathers that he would give it
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Blessed shalt thou be among all people. No one shall be
barren among you of either sex, neither of men nor
cattle.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord will take away from thee all sickness: and the
grievous infirmities of Egypt, which thou knowest, he will not
bring upon thee, but upon thy enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt consume all the people, which the Lord thy God
will deliver to thee. Thy eye shall not spare them, neither shalt
thou serve their gods, lest they be thy ruin.</span></li>
<li><span>If thou say in thy heart: These nations are more than I,
how shall I be able to destroy them?</span></li>
<li><span>Fear not, but remember what the Lord thy God did to
Pharao and to all the Egyptians,</span></li>
<li><span>The exceeding great plagues, which thy eyes saw, and the
signs and wonders, and the strong hand, and the stretched out arm,
with which the Lord thy God brought thee out: so will he do to all
the people, whom thou fearest.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover the Lord thy God will send also hornets among
them, until he destroy and consume all that have escaped thee, and
could hide themselves.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt not fear them, because the Lord thy God is in
the midst of thee, a God mighty and terrible:</span></li>
<li><span>He will consume these nations in thy sight by little and
little and by degrees. Thou wilt not be able to destroy them
altogether: lest perhaps the beasts of the earth should increase
upon thee.</span></li>
<li><span>But the Lord thy God shall deliver them in thy sight: and
shall slay them until they be utterly destroyed.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall deliver their kings into thy hands, and thou
shalt destroy their names from under Heaven: no man shall be able
to resist thee, until thou destroy them.</span></li>
<li><span>Their graven things thou shalt burn with fire: thou shalt
not covet the silver and gold of which they are made, neither shalt
thou take to thee any thing thereof, lest thou offend, because it
is an abomination to the Lord thy God.</span></li>
<li><span>Neither shalt thou bring any thing of the idol into thy
house, lest thou become an anathema, like it. Thou shalt detest it
as dung, and shalt utterly abhor it as uncleanness and filth,
because it is an anathema.</span></li>

<li><span>All the commandments, that I command thee this day, take
great care to observe: that you may live, and be multiplied, and
going in may possess the land, for which the Lord swore to your
fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt remember all the way through which the
Lord thy God hath brought thee for forty years through the desert,
to afflict thee and to prove thee, and that the things that were in
thy heart might be made known, whether thou wouldst keep his
commandments or no.</span></li>
<li><span>He afflicted thee with want, and gave thee manna for thy
food, which neither thou nor thy fathers knew: to shew that m not
in bread alone doth man live, but in every word that proceedeth
from the mouth of God.</span></li>
<li><span>Thy raiment, with which thou wast covered, hath not
decayed for age, and thy foot is not worn, lo this is the fortieth
year,</span></li>
<li><span>That thou mayst consider in thy heart, that as a man
traineth up his son, so the Lord thy God hath trained thee
up.</span></li>
<li><span>That thou shouldst keep the commandments of the Lord thy
God, and walk in his ways, and fear him.</span></li>
<li><span>For the Lord thy God will bring thee into a good land, of
brooks and of waters, and of fountains: in the plains of which and
the hills deep rivers break out:</span></li>
<li><span>A land of wheat, and barley, and vineyards, wherein fig
trees and pomegranates, and oliveyards grow: a land of oil and
honey.</span></li>
<li><span>Where without any want thou shalt eat thy bread, and
enjoy abundance of all things: where the stones are iron, and out
of its hills are dug mines of brass:</span></li>
<li><span>That when thou hast eaten, and art full, thou mayst bless
the Lord thy God for the excellent land which he hath given
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Take heed, and beware lest at any time thou forget the
Lord thy God, and neglect his commandments and judgments and
ceremonies, which I command thee this day:</span></li>
<li><span>Lest after thou hast eaten and art filled, hast built
goodly houses, and dwelt in them,</span></li>
<li><span>And shalt have herds of oxen and flocks of sheep, and
plenty of gold and of silver, and of all things,</span></li>
<li><span>Thy heart be lifted up, and thou remember not the Lord
thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the
house of bondage:</span></li>
<li><span>And was thy leader in the great and terrible wilderness,
wherein there was the serpent burning with his breath, and the
scorpion and the dipsas, and no waters at all: who brought forth
streams out of the hardest rock,</span></li>
<li><span>And fed thee in the wilderness with manna which thy
fathers knew not. And after he had afflicted and proved thee, at
the last he had mercy on thee,</span></li>
<li><span>Lest thou shouldst say in thy heart: My own might, and
the strength of my own hand have achieved all these things for
me.</span></li>
<li><span>But remember the Lord thy God, that he hath given thee
strength, that he might fulfil his covenant, concerning which he
swore to thy fathers, as this present day sheweth.</span></li>
<li><span>But if thou forget the Lord thy God, and follow strange
gods, and serve and adore them: behold now I foretell thee that
thou shalt utterly perish.</span></li>
<li><span>As the nations, which the Lord destroyed at thy entrance,
so shall you also perish, if you be disobedient to the voice of the
Lord your God.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="9">Deuteronomy 9</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Hear, O Israel: Thou shalt go over the Jordan this day;
to possess nations very great, and stronger than thyself, cities
great, and walled up to the sky,</span></li>
<li><span>A People great and tall, the sons of the Enacims, whom
thou hast seen, and heard of, against whom no man is able to
stand.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt know therefore this day that the Lord thy God
himself will pass over before thee, a devouring and consuming fire,
to destroy and extirpate and bring them to nothing before thy face
quickly, as he hath spoken to thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Say not in thy heart, when the Lord thy God shall have
destroyed them in thy sight: For my justice hath the Lord brought
me in to possess this land, whereas these nations are destroyed for
their wickedness.</span></li>
<li><span>For it is not for thy justices, and the uprightness of
thy heart that thou shalt go in to possess their lands: but because
they have done wickedly, they are destroyed at thy coming in: and
that the Lord might accomplish his word, which he promised by oath
to thy fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</span></li>
<li><span>Know therefore that the Lord thy God giveth thee not this
excellent land in possession for thy justices, for thou art a very
stiffnecked people.</span></li>
<li><span>Remember, and forget not how then provokedst the Lord thy
God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day that thou camest out
of Egypt unto this place, thou hast always strove against the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>For in Horeb also thou didst provoke him, and he was
angry, and would have destroyed thee,</span></li>
<li><span>When I went up into the mount to receive the tables of
stone, the tables of the covenant which the Lord made with you: and
I continued in the mount forty days and nights, neither eating
bread, nor drinking water.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord gave me two tables of stone written with the
finger of God, and containing all the words that he spoke to you in
the mount from the midst of the Are, when the people were assembled
together.</span></li>
<li><span>And when forty days were passed, and as many nights, the
Lord gave me the two tables of stone, the tables of the
covenant,</span></li>
<li><span>And said to me: Arise, and go down from hence quickly:
for thy people, which thou hast brought out of Egypt, have quickly
forsaken the way that thou hast shewn them, and have made to
themselves a molten idol.</span></li>
<li><span>And again the Lord said to me: I see that this people is
stiffnecked:</span></li>
<li><span>Let me alone that I may destroy them, and abolish their
name from under heaven, and set thee over a nation, that is greater
and stronger than this.</span></li>
<li><span>And when I came down from the burning mount, and held the
two tables of the covenant with both hands,</span></li>
<li><span>And saw that you had sinned against the Lord your God,
and had made to yourselves a molten calf, and had quickly forsaken
his way, which he had shewn you:</span></li>
<li><span>I cast the tables out of my hands, and broke them in your
sight.</span></li>
<li><span>And I fell down before the Lord se before, forty days and
nights neither eating bread, nor drinking water, for all your sins,
which you had committed against the Lord, and had provoked him to
wrath:</span></li>
<li><span>For I feared his indignation and anger, wherewith being
moved against you, he would have destroyed you. And the Lord heard
me this time also.</span></li>
<li><span>And he was exceeding angry against Aaron also, and would
have destroyed him, and I prayed in like manner for
him.</span></li>
<li><span>And your sin that you had committed, that is, the calf, I
took, and burned it with fire, and breaking it into pieces, until
it was as small as dust, I threw it into the torrent, which cometh
down from the mountain.</span></li>
<li><span>At the burning also, and at the place of temptation, and
at the graves of lust you provoked the Lord:</span></li>
<li><span>And when he sent you from Cadesbarne, saying: Go up, and
possess the land that I have given you, and you slighted the
commandment of the Lord your God, and did not believe him, neither
would you hearken to his voice:</span></li>
<li><span>But were always rebellious from the day that I began to
know you.</span></li>
<li><span>And I lay prostrate before the Lord forty days and
nights, in which I humbly besought him, that he would not destroy
you as he had threatened:</span></li>
<li><span>And praying, I said: 0 Lord God, destroy not thy people,
and thy inheritance, which thou hast redeemed in thy greatness,
whom thou hast brought out of Egypt with a strong hand.</span></li>
<li><span>Remember thy servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: look not
on the stubbornness of this people, nor on their wickedness and
sin:</span></li>
<li><span>Lest perhaps the inhabitants of the land, out of which
thou hast brought us, say: The Lord could not bring them into the
land that he promised them, and he hated them: therefore he brought
them out, that he might kill them in the wilderness,</span></li>
<li><span>Who are thy people and thy inheritance, whom thou hast
brought out by thy great strength, and in thy stretched out
arm.</span></li>

<li><span>At that time the Lord said to me: Hew thee two tables of
stone like the former, and come up to me into the mount: and thou
shalt make an ark of mood,</span></li>
<li><span>And I will write on the tables the words that were in
them, which thou brokest before, and thou shalt put them in the
ark.</span></li>
<li><span>And I made an ark of setim wood And when I had hewn two
tables of stone like the former, I went up into the mount, having
them in my hands.</span></li>
<li><span>And he wrote in the tables, according as he had written
before, the ten words, which the Lord spoke to you in the mount
from the midst of the fire, when the people were assembled: and he
gave them to me.</span></li>
<li><span>And returning from the mount, I came down, and put the
tables into the ark, that I had made, and they are there till this
present, as the Lord commanded me.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Israel removed their camp from Beroth
of the children of Jacan into Mosera, where Aaron died and was
buried, and Eleazar his son succeeded him in the priestly
office.</span></li>
<li><span>From thence they came to Gadgad, from which place they
departed, and camped in Jetebatha, in a land of waters and
torrents.</span></li>
<li><span>At that time he separated the tribe of Levi, to carry the
ark of the covenant of the Lord, and to stand before him in the
ministry, and to bless in his name until this present
day.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore Levi hath no part nor possession with his
brethren: because the Lord himself is his possession, as the Lord
thy God promised him.</span></li>
<li><span>And I stood in the mount, as before, forty days and
nights: and the Lord heard me this time also, and would not destroy
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to me: Go, and walk before the people, that
they may enter, and possess the land, which I swore to their
fathers that I would give them.</span></li>
<li><span>And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of
thee, but that thou fear the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways,
and love him, and serve the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and
with all thy soul:</span></li>
<li><span>And keep the commandments of the Lord, and his
ceremonies, which I command thee this day, that it may be well with
thee?</span></li>
<li><span>Behold heaven is the Lord's thy God, and the heaven of
heaven, the earth and all things that are therein.</span></li>
<li><span>And yet the Lord hath been closely joined to thy fathers,
and loved them and chose their seed after them, that is to say,
you, out of all nations, as this day it is proved.</span></li>
<li><span>Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and
stiffen your neck no more.</span></li>
<li><span>Because the Lord your God he is the God of gods, and the
Lord of lords, a great God and mighty and terrible, a who accepteth
no person nor taketh bribes.</span></li>
<li><span>He doth judgment to the fatherless and the widow, loveth

<li><span>He is thy praise, and thy God, that hath done for thee

<li><span>Therefore love the Lord thy God and observe his precepts
and ceremonies, his judgments and commandments at all
times.</span></li>
<li><span>Know this day the things that your children know not, who
saw not the chastisements of the Lord your God. his great doings
and strong hand, and stretched out arm,</span></li>
<li><span>The signs and works which he did in the midst of Egypt to
king Pharao, and to all his land,</span></li>
<li><span>And to all the host of the Egyptians, and to their horses
and chariots: how the waters of the Red Sea covered them, when they
pursued you, and how the Lord destroyed them until this present
day:</span></li>
<li><span>And what he hath done to you in the wilderness, till you
came to this place:</span></li>
<li><span>And to Dathan and Abiron the sons of Eliab, who was the
son of Ruben: whom the earth, opening her mouth swallowed up with
their households and tents, and all their substance, which they had
in the midst of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Your eyes have seen all the greet works of the Lord, that
he hath done,</span></li>
<li><span>That you may keep all his commandments, which I command
you this day, and may go in, and possess the land, to which you are
entering,</span></li>
<li><span>And may live in it a long time: which the Lord promised
by oath to your fathers, and to their seed, a land which floweth
with milk and honey.</span></li>
<li><span>For the land, which thou goest to possess, is not like
the land of Egypt, from whence thou camest out, where, when the
seed is sown, waters are brought in to water it after the manner of
gardens.</span></li>
<li><span>But it is a land of hills and plains, expecting rain from
heaven.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord thy God doth always visit it, and his eyes
are on it from the beginning of the year unto the end
thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>If then you obey my commandments, which I command you
this day, that you love the Lord your God, and serve him with all
your heart, and with all your soul:</span></li>
<li><span>He will give to your land the early rain and the latter
rain, that you may gather in your corn, and your wine, and your
oil,</span></li>
<li><span>And your hay out of the fields to feed your cattle, and
that you may eat and be filled.</span></li>
<li><span>Beware lest perhaps your heart be deceived, and you
depart from the Lord, and serve strange gods, and adore
them:</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord being angry shut up heaven, that the rain
come not down, nor the earth yield her fruit, and you perish
quickly from the excellent land, which the Lord will give
you.</span></li>
<li><span>Lay up these my words in your hearts and minds, and hang
them for a sign on your hands, and place them between your
eyes.</span></li>
<li><span>Teach your children that they meditate on them, when thou
sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest on the way, end when
thou liest down and risest up.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt write them upon the posts and the doors of thy
house:</span></li>
<li><span>That thy days may be multiplied, and the days of thy
children in the land which the Lord swore to thy fathers, that he
would give them as long as the heaven hangeth over the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>For if you keep the commandments which I command you, and
do them, to love the Lord your God, and walk in all his ways,
cleaving unto him,</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord will destroy all these nations before your face,
and you shall possess them, which are greater and stronger than
you.</span></li>
<li><span>Every place, that your foot shall tread upon, shall be
yours. From the desert, and from Libanus, from the great river
Euphrates unto the western sea shall be your borders.</span></li>
<li><span>None shall stand against you: the Lord your God shall lay
the dread and fear of you upon all the land that you shall tread
upon, as he hath spoken to you.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I set forth in your sight this day a blessing and
a curse:</span></li>
<li><span>A blessing, if you obey the commandments of the Lord your
God, which I command you this day:</span></li>
<li><span>A curse, if you obey not the commandments of the Lord
your. God, but revolt from the way which now I shew you, and walk
after strange gods which you know not.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into
the land, whither thou goest to dwell, thou shalt put the blessing
upon mount Garizim, the curse upon mount Hebal:</span></li>
<li><span>Which are beyond the Jordan, behind the way that goeth to
the setting of the sun, in the land of the Chanaanite who dwelleth
in the plain country over against Galgala, which is near the valley
that reacheth and entereth far.</span></li>
<li><span>For you shall pass over the Jordan, to possess the land,
which the Lord your God will give you, that you may have it and
possess it.</span></li>
<li><span>See therefore that you fulfil the ceremonies and
judgments, which I shall set this day before you.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="12">Deuteronomy 12</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>These are the precepts and judgments, that you must do in
the land, which the Lord the God of thy fathers will give thee, to
possess it all the days that thou shalt walk upon the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>Destroy all the places in which the nations, that you
shall possess, worshipped their gods upon high mountains, and
hills, and under every shady tree:</span></li>
<li><span>Overthrow their altars, and break down their statues,
burn their groves with fire, and break their idols in pieces:
destroy their names out of those places.</span></li>
<li><span>You shall not do so to the Lord your God:</span></li>
<li><span>But you shall come to the place, which the Lord your God
shall choose out of all your tribes, to put his name there, and to
dwell in it:</span></li>
<li><span>And you shall offer in that place your holocausts and
victims, the tithes and firstfruits of your hands and your vows and
gifts, the firstborn of your herds and your sheep.</span></li>
<li><span>And you shall eat there in the sight of the Lord your
God: and you shall rejoice in all things, whereunto you shall put
your hand, you and your houses wherein the Lord your God hath
blessed you.</span></li>
<li><span>You shall not do there the things we do here this day,
every man that which seemeth good to himself.</span></li>
<li><span>For until this present time you are not come to refit,
and to the possession, which the Lord your God will give
you.</span></li>
<li><span>You shall pass over the Jordan, and shall dwell in the
land which the Lord your God will give you, that you may have rest
from all enemies round about: and may dwell without any
fear,</span></li>
<li><span>In the place, which the Lord your God shall choose, that
his name may be therein. Thither shall you bring all the things
that I command you, holocausts, and victims, and tithes, and the
firstfruits of your hands: and whatsoever is the choicest in the
gifts which you shall vow to the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>There shall you feast before the Lord your God, you and
your sons and your daughters, your menservants and maid- servants,
and the Levite that dwelleth in your cities. For he hath no other
part and possession among you.</span></li>
<li><span>Beware lest thou offer thy holocausts in every place that
thou shalt see:</span></li>
<li><span>But in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of
thy tribes shalt thou offer sacrifices. and shalt do all that I
command thee.</span></li>
<li><span>But if thou desirest to eat, and the eating of flesh
delight thee, kill, and eat according to the blessing of the Lord
thy God, which he hath given thee, in thy cities: whether it be
unclean, that is to say, having blemish or defect: or clean, that
is to say, sound and without blemish, such as may be offered, as
the roe, and the hart, shalt thou eat it:</span></li>
<li><span>Only the blood thou shalt not eat, but thou shalt pour it
out upon the earth as water.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou mayst not eat in thy towns the tithes of thy corn,
and thy wine, and thy oil, the firstborn of thy herds and thy
cattle, nor any thing that thou vowest, and that thou wilt offer
voluntarily, and the firstfruits of thy hands:</span></li>
<li><span>But thou shalt eat them before the Lord thy God in the
place which the Lord thy God shall choose, thou and thy son and thy
daughter, and thy manservant, and maidservant, and the Levite that
dwelleth in thy cities: and thou shalt rejoice and be refreshed
before the Lord thy God in all things, whereunto thou shalt put thy
hand.</span></li>
<li><span>Take heed thou forsake not the Levite all the time that
thou livest in the land.</span></li>
<li><span>When the Lord thy God shall have enlarged thy borders, as
he hath spoken to thee, and thou wilt eat the flesh that thy soul
desireth:</span></li>
<li><span>And if the place which the Lord thy God shall choose,
that his name should be there, be far off, thou shalt kill of thy
herds and of thy docks, as I have commanded thee, and shalt eat in
thy towns, as it pleaseth thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Even as the roe and the hart is eaten, so shalt thou eat
them: both the clean and unclean shall eat of them
alike.</span></li>
<li><span>Only beware of this, that thou eat not the blood, for the
blood is for the soul: and therefore thou must not eat the soul
with the flesh:</span></li>
<li><span>But thou shalt pour it upon the earth as
water,</span></li>
<li><span>That it may be well with thee and thy children after
thee, when thou shalt do that which is pleasing in the sight of the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>But the things which thou hast sanctified and vowed to
the Lord, thou shalt take, and shalt come to the place which the
Lord shall choose:</span></li>
<li><span>And shalt offer thy oblations the flesh and the blood
upon the altar of the Lord thy God: the blood of thy victims thou
shalt pour on the altar: and the flesh thou thyself shalt
eat.</span></li>
<li><span>Observe and hear all the things that I command thee, that
it may be well with thee and thy children after thee for ever, when
thou shalt do what is good and pleasing in the sight of the Lord
thy God.</span></li>
<li><span>When the Lord thy God shall have destroyed before thy
face the nations, which then shalt go in to possess, and when thou
shalt possess them, and dwell in their land:</span></li>
<li><span>Beware lest thou imitate them, after they are destroyed
at thy coming in, and lest thou seek after their ceremonies,
saying: As these nations have worshipped their gods, so will I also
worship.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt not do in like manner to the Lord thy God. For
they have done to their gods all the abominations which the Lord
abhorreth, offering their sons and daughters, and burning them with
fire.</span></li>
<li><span>What I command thee, that only do thou to the Lord:
neither add any thing, nor diminish.</span></li>

certain, and that this abomination hath been really

that are in it, even the cattle.</span></li>

<li><span>Thou shalt take an awl, and bore through his ear in the
door of thy house, and he shall serve thee for ever: thou shalt do
in like manner to thy womanservant also.</span></li>
<li><span>Turn not away thy eyes from them when thou makest them
tree: because he hath served thee six years according to the wages
of a hireling: that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the
works that thou dost.</span></li>
<li><span>Of the firstlings, that come of thy herds and thy sheep,
thou shalt sanctify to the Lord thy God whatsoever is of the male

<li><span>In the sight of the Lord thy God shalt thou eat them
every year, in the place that the Lord shall choose, thou and thy

<li><span>But if it have a blemish, or be lame, or blind, or in any
part disfigured or feeble, it shall not be sacrificed to the Lord
thy God.</span></li>
<li><span>But thou shalt eat it within the gates of thy city: the

evil in the sight of the Lord thy God, and transgress his
covenant,</span></li>
<li><span>So as to go and serve strange gods, and adore them, the
sun and the moon. and all the host of heaven, which I have not
commanded:</span></li>
<li><span>And this is told thee, and hearing it thou hast inquired
diligently, and found it to be true, and that the abomination is
committed in Israel:</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt bring forth the man or the woman, who have
committed that most wicked thing, to the gates of thy city, and
they shall be stoned.</span></li>
<li><span>By the mouth of two or three witnesses shall he die that
is to be slain. Let no man be put to death, when only one beareth
witness against him.</span></li>
<li><span>The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to
kill him, and afterwards the hands of the rest of the people: that
thou mayst take away the evil out of the midst of thee.</span></li>
<li><span>If thou perceive that there be among you a hard and
doubtful matter in judgment between blood and blood, cause and
cause, leprosy and leprosy: and thou see that the words of the
judges within thy gates do vary: arise, and go up to the place,
which the Lord thy God shall choose.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt come to the priests of the Levitical race,
and to the judge, that shall be at that time: and thou shalt ask of
them, and they shall shew thee the truth of the
judgment.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt do whatsoever they shall say, that preside
in the place, which the Lord shall choose, and what they shall
teach thee,</span></li>
<li><span>According to his law; and thou shalt follow their
sentence: neither shalt thou decline to the right hand nor to the
left hand.</span></li>
<li><span>But he that will be proud, and refuse to obey the
commandment of the priest, who ministereth at that time to the Lord
thy God, and the decree of the judge, that man shall die, and thou
shalt take away the evil from Israel:</span></li>
<li><span>And all the people hearing it shall fear, that no one
afterwards swell with pride.</span></li>
<li><span>When thou art come into the land, which the Lord thy God
will give thee, and possessest it, and shalt say: I will set a king
over me, as all nations have that are round about:</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt set him whom the Lord thy God shall choose out
of the number of thy brethren. Thou mayst not make a man of another
nation king, that is not thy brother.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he is made king, he shall not multiply horses to
himself, nor lead back the people into Egypt, being lifted up with
the number of his horsemen, especially since the Lord hath
commanded you to return no more the same way.</span></li>
<li><span>He shall not have many wives, that may allure his mind,
nor immense sums of silver and gold.</span></li>
<li><span>But after he is raised to the throne of his kingdom, he
shall copy out to himself the Deuteronomy of this law in a volume,
taking the copy of the priests of the Levitical tribe,</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall have it with him, and shall read it all the
days of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, and
keep his words and ceremonies, that are commanded in the
law;</span></li>
<li><span>And that his heart be not lifted up with pride over his
brethren, nor decline to the right or to the left, that he and his
sons may reign a long time over Israel.</span></li>

<li><span>The priests and Levites, and all that are of the same
tribe, shall have no part nor inheritance with the rest of Israel,
because they shall eat the sacrifices of the Lord, and his
oblations,</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall receive nothing else. of the possession of
their brethren: for the Lord himself is their inheritance, as he
hath said to them.</span></li>
<li><span>This shall be the priest's due from the people, and from
them that offer victims: whether they sacrifice an ox, or a sheep,
they shall give to the priest the shoulder and the
breast:</span></li>
<li><span>The firstfruits also of corn, of wine, and of oil, and a
part of the wool from the shearing of their sheep.</span></li>
<li><span>For the Lord thy God hath chosen him of all thy tribes,
to stand and to minister to the name of the Lord, him and his sons
for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>If a Levite go out of any one of the cities throughout
all Israel, in which he dwelleth, and have a longing mind to come

<li><span>He shall minister in the name of the Lord his God, as all
his brethren the Levites do, that shall stand at that time before
the Lord.</span></li>

from his fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>When thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God
shall give thee, beware lest thou have a mind to imitate the
abominations of those nations.</span></li>
<li><span>Neither let there be found among you any one that shall
expiate his son or daughter, making them to pass through the fire:
or that consulteth soothsayers, or observeth dreams and omens,
neither let there be any wizard,</span></li>
<li><span>Nor charmer, nor any one that consulteth pythonic
spirits, or fortune tellers, or that seeketh the truth from the
dead.</span></li>
<li><span>For the Lord abhorreth all these things, and for these
abominations he will destroy them at thy coming.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt be perfect, and without spot before the Lord
thy God.</span></li>
<li><span>These nations, whose land thou shalt possess, hearken to
soothsayers and diviners: but thou art otherwise instructed by the
Lord thy God.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord thy God will raise up to thee a PROPHET of thy
nation and of thy brethren like unto me: him thou shalt
hear:</span></li>
<li><span>As thou desiredst of the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the
assembly was gathered together, and saidst: Let me not hear any
more the voice of the Lord my God, neither let me see any more this
exceeding great fire, lest I die.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to me: They have spoken all things
well.</span></li>
<li><span>m I will raise them up a prophet out of the midst of
their brethren like to thee: and I will put my words in his mouth,
and he shall speak to them all that I shall command
him.</span></li>
<li><span>And he that will not hear his words, which he shall speak
in my name, I will be the revenger.</span></li>
<li><span>But the prophet, who being corrupted with pride, shall
speak in my name things that I did not command him to say, or in
the name of strange gods, shall be slain.</span></li>
<li><span>And if in silent thought thou answer: How shall I know
the word that the Lord hath not spoken?</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt have this sign: Whatsoever that same prophet
foretelleth in the name of the Lord, and it cometh not to pass:
that thing the Lord hath not spoken, but the prophet hath forged it
by the pride of his mind: and therefore thou shalt not fear
him.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>When the Lord thy God hath destroyed the nations, whose
land he will deliver to thee, and thou shalt possess it, and shalt
dwell in the cities and houses thereof :</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt separate to thee three cities in the midst of
the land, which the Lord will give thee in possession,</span></li>
<li><span>Paving diligently the way: and thou shalt divide the
whole province of thy land equally into three parts: that he who is
forced to flee for manslaughter, may have near at hand whither to
escape.</span></li>
<li><span>This shall be the law of the slayer that fleeth, whose
life is to be saved: He that killeth his neighbour ignorantly, and
who is proved to have had no hatred against him yesterday and the
day before:</span></li>
<li><span>But to have gone with him to the wood to hew wood, and in
cutting down the tree the axe slipped out of his hand, and the iron
slipping from the handle struck his friend, and killed him: he
shall flee to one of the cities aforesaid, and live:</span></li>
<li><span>Lest perhaps the next kinsman of him whose blood was
shed, pushed on by his grief should pursue, and apprehend him. if
the way be too long, and take away the life of him who is not
guilty of death, because he is proved to have had no hatred before
against him that was slain.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore I command thee, that thou separate three cities
at equal distance one from another.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the Lord thy God shall have enlarged thy
borders, as he swore to thy fathers, and shall give thee all the
land that he promised them,</span></li>
<li><span>(Yet so, if thou keep his commandments, and do the things
which I command thee this day, that thou love the Lord thy God, and
walk in his ways at all times) thou shalt add to thee other three
cities, and shalt double the number of the three cities
aforesaid:</span></li>
<li><span>That innocent blood may not be shed in the midst of the
land which the Lord thy God will give thee to possess, lest thou be
guilty of blood.</span></li>
<li><span>But if any man hating his neighbour, lie in wait for his
life, and rise and strike him, and he die, and he flee to one of
the cities aforesaid,</span></li>
<li><span>The ancients of his city shall send, and take him out of
the place of refuge, and shall deliver him into the hand of the
kinsman of him whose blood was shed, and he shall die.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt not pity him, and thou shalt take away the
guilt of innocent blood out of Israel, that it may be well with
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt not take nor remove thy neighbour's landmark,
which thy predecessors have set in thy possession. which the Lord
thy God will give thee in the land that thou shalt receive to
possess.</span></li>
<li><span>One witness shall not rise up against any man, whatsoever
the sin or wickedness be: but in the mouth of two or three
witnesses every word shall stand.</span></li>
<li><span>If a lying witness stand against a man, accusing him of
transgression,</span></li>
<li><span>Both of them, between whom the controversy is, shall
stand before the Lord in the sight of the priests and the judges
that shall be in those days.</span></li>
<li><span>And when after most diligent inquisition, they shall find
that the false witness hath told a lie against his
brother:</span></li>
<li><span>They shall render to him as he meant to do to his
brother, and thou shalt take away the evil out of the midst of
thee:</span></li>
<li><span>That others hearing may fear, and may not dare to do such
things.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt not pity him, but shalt require life for life,
eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for
foot.</span></li>

<li><span>If thou go out to war against thy enemies, and see
horsemen and chariots, and the numbers of the enemy's army greater
than thine, thou shalt not fear them: because the Lord thy God is
with thee, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the battle is now at hand, the priest shall
stand before the army, and shall speak to the people in this
manner:</span></li>
<li><span>Hear, O Israel, you join battle this day against your
enemies, let not your heart be dismayed, be not afraid, do not give
back, fear ye them not:</span></li>
<li><span>Because the Lord your God is in the midst of you, and
will fight for you against your enemies, to deliver you from
danger.</span></li>
<li><span>And the captains shall proclaim through every band in the
hearing of the army: What man is there, that hath built a new
house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his
house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate
it.</span></li>
<li><span>What man is there, that hath planted a vineyard, and hath
not as yet made it to be common, whereof all men may eat? let him
go, and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another
man execute his office.</span></li>
<li><span>What man is there, that hath espoused a wife, and not
taken her? let him go, and return to his house, lest he die in the
war, and another man take her.</span></li>
<li><span>After these things are declared they shall add the rest,
and shall speak to the people: What man is there that is fearful,
and faint hearted? let him go, and return to his house, lest he
make the hearts of his brethren to fear, as he himself is possessed
with fear.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the captains of the army shall hold their peace,
and have made an end of speaking, every man shall prepare their
bands to fight.</span></li>
<li><span>If at any time thou come to fight against a city, thou
shalt first offer it peace.</span></li>
<li><span>If they receive it, and open the gates to thee, all the
people that are therein, shall be saved, and shall serve thee
paying tribute.</span></li>
<li><span>But if they will not make peace, and shall begin war
against thee, thou shalt besiege it.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the Lord thy God shall deliver it into thy
bands, thou shalt slay all that are therein of the male sex, with
the edge of the sword,</span></li>
<li><span>Excepting women and children, cattle and other things,
that are in the city. And thou shalt divide all the prey to the
army, and thou shalt eat the spoils of thy enemies, which the Lord
thy God shall give thee.</span></li>
<li><span>So shalt thou do to all cities that are at a great
distance from thee, and are not of these cities which thou shalt
receive in possession.</span></li>
<li><span>But of those cities that shall be given thee, thou shalt
suffer none at all to live:</span></li>
<li><span>But shalt kill them with the edge of the sword, to wit,
the Hethite, and the Amorrhite, and the Chanaanite, the Pherezite,
and the Hevite, and the Jebusite, as the Lord thy God hath
commanded thee:</span></li>
<li><span>Lest they teach you to do all the abominations which they
have done to their gods: and you should sin against the Lord your
God.</span></li>
<li><span>When thou hast besieged a city a long time, and hath
compassed it with bulwarks to take it, thou shalt not cut down the
trees that may be eaten of, neither shalt thou spoil the country
round about with axes: for it is a tree, and not a man, neither can
it increase the number of them that fight against thee.</span></li>
<li><span>But if there be any trees that are not fruitful, but
wild, and fit for other uses, cut them down, and make engines,
until thou take the city, which fighteth against thee.</span></li>

who is guilty of the murder,</span></li>
<li><span>Thy ancients and judges shall go out, and shall measure
from the place where the body lieth the distance of every city
round about:</span></li>
<li><span>And the ancients of that city which they shall perceive
to be nearer than the rest, shall take a heifer of the herd, that
hath not drawn in the yoke, nor ploughed the ground,</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall bring her into a rough and stony valley,
that never was ploughed, nor sown: and there they shall strike off
the head of the heifer:</span></li>

Lord thy God hath chosen to minister to him, and to bless in his

slain, and shall wash their hands over the heifer that was killed

shall remain in thy house, and mourn for her father and mother one
month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and shalt sleep
with her, and she shall be thy wife.</span></li>
<li><span>Rut if afterwards she please thee not, thou shalt let her
go free, but thou mayst not sell her for money nor oppress her by
might because thou hast humbled her.</span></li>

hated, and they have had children by him, and the son of the hated
be the firstborn,</span></li>

may not make the son of the beloved the firstborn, and prefer him
before the son of the hated.</span></li>
<li><span>But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the
firstborn, and shall give him a double portion of all he hath: for
this is the first of his children, and to him are due the first
birthrights.</span></li>
<li><span>If a man have a stubborn and unruly son, who will not
hear the commandments of his father or mother, and being corrected,
slighteth obedience:</span></li>
<li><span>They shall take him and bring him to the ancients of his
city, and to the gate of judgment,</span></li>
<li><span>And shall say to them: This our son is rebellious and
stubborn, he slighteth hearing our admonitions, he giveth himself
to revelling, and to debauchery and banquetings:</span></li>
<li><span>The people of the city shall stone him: and he shall die,
that you may take away the evil out of the midst of you, and all
Israel hearing it may be afraid.</span></li>
<li><span>When a man hath committed a crime for which he is to be
punished with death, and being condemned to die is hanged on a
gibbet:</span></li>
<li><span>His body shall not remain upon the tree, but shall be
buried the same day: for he is accursed of God that hangeth on a

<li><span>If a man take a wife, and have her, and she find not
favour in his eyes, for some uncleanness: he shall write a bill of
divorce, and shall give it in her hand, and send her out of his
house.</span></li>
<li><span>And when she is departed, and marrieth another
husband,</span></li>
<li><span>And he also hateth her, and hath given her a bill of
divorce, and hath sent her out of his house or is dead:</span></li>
<li><span>The former husband cannot take her again to wife: because
she is defiled, and is become abominable before the Lord: lest thou
cause thy land to sin, which the Lord thy God shall give thee to
possess.</span></li>
<li><span>When a man hath lately taken a wife, he shall not go out
to war, neither shall any public business be enjoined him, but he
shall be free at home without fault, that for one year he may
rejoice with his wife.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt not take the nether, nor the upper millstone
to pledge: for he hath pledged his life to thee.</span></li>
<li><span>If ally man be found soliciting his brother of the
children of Israel, and selling him shall take a price, he shall be
put to death, and thou shalt take away the evil from the midst of
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Observe diligently that thou incur not the stroke of the
leprosy, but thou shalt do whatsoever the priests of the Levitical
race shall teach thee, according to what I have commanded them, and
fulfil thou it carefully.</span></li>
<li><span>Remember what the Lord your God did to Mary, in the way
when you came out of Egypt.</span></li>
<li><span>When thou shalt demand of thy neighbour any thing that he
oweth thee, thou shalt not go into his house to take away a pledge
:</span></li>
<li><span>But then shalt stand without, and he shall bring out to
thee what he hath.</span></li>
<li><span>But if he be poor, the pledge shall not lodge with thee
that night,</span></li>
<li><span>But thou shalt restore it to him presently before the
going down of the sun: that he may sleep in his own raiment and
bless thee, and thou mayst have justice before the Lord thy
God.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt not refuse the hire of the needy, and the
poor, whether he be thy brother, or a stranger that dwelleth with
thee in the land, and is within thy gates:</span></li>
<li><span>But thou shalt pay him the price of his labour the same
day, before the going down of the sun, because he is poor, and with
it maintaineth his life: lest he cry against thee to the Lord, and
it be reputed to thee for a sin.</span></li>
<li><span>The fathers shall not be put to death for the children,
nor the children for the fathers, but every one shall die for his
own sin.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger nor
of the fatherless, neither shalt thou take away the widow's raiment
for a pledge.</span></li>
<li><span>Remember that thou wast a slave in Egypt, and the Lord
thy God delivered thee from thence. Therefore I command thee to do
this thing.</span></li>
<li><span>When thou hast reaped the corn in thy field, and hast
forgot and left a sheaf, thou shalt not return to take it away: but
thou shalt suffer the stranger, and the fatherless and the widow to
tabs it away: that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the works
of thy hands.</span></li>
<li><span>If thou have gathered the fruit of thy olive trees, thou
shalt not return to gather whatsoever remaineth on the trees: but
shalt leave it for the stranger, for the fatherless, and the
widow.</span></li>
<li><span>If thou make the vintage of thy vineyard, thou shalt not
gather the clusters that remain, but they shall be for the
stranger, the fatherless, and the widow.</span></li>
<li><span>Remember that thou also wast a bondman in Egypt, and
therefore I command thee to do this thing.</span></li>

<li><span>If there be a controversy between men, and they call upon
the judges: they shall give the prize of justice to him whom they
perceive to be just: and him whom they find to be wicked, they
shall condemn of wickedness.</span></li>
<li><span>And if they see that the offender be worthy of stripes:
they shall lay him down, and shall cause him to be beaten before
them. According to the measure of the sin shall the measure also of
the stripes be:</span></li>
<li><span>Yet so, that they exceed not the number of forty: lest
thy brother depart shamefully torn before thy eyes.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out thy corn
on the floor.</span></li>
<li><span>When brethren dwell together, and one of them dieth
without children, the wife of the deceased shall not marry to
another: but his brother shall take her, and raise up seed for his
brother:</span></li>
<li><span>And the first son he shall have of her he shall call by
his name, that his name be not abolished out of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>But if he will not take his brother's wife, who by law
belongeth to him, the woman shall go to the gate of the city, and
call upon the ancients, and say: My husband's brother refuseth to
raise up his brother's name in Israel: and will not take me to
wife.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall cause him to be sent for forthwith, and
shall ask him. If he answer: I will not take her to
wife:</span></li>
<li><span>The woman shall come to him before the ancients, and
shall take off his shoe from his foot, and spit in his face, and
say: So shall it be done to the man that will not build up his
brother's house:</span></li>
<li><span>And his name shall be called in Israel, the house of the
unshod.</span></li>
<li><span>If two men have words together, and one begin to fight
against the other, and the other's wife willing to deliver her
husband out of the hand of the stronger, shall put forth her hand,
and take him by the secrets,</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt cut off her hand, neither shalt thou be moved
with any pity in her regard.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt not have divers weights in thy bag, a greater
and a less:</span></li>
<li><span>Neither shall there be in thy house a greater bushel and
a less.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt have a just and a true weight, and thy bushel
shall be equal and true: that thou mayest live a long time upon the
land which the Lord thy God shall give thee.</span></li>
<li><span>For the Lord thy God abhorreth him that doth these
things, and he hateth all injustice.</span></li>
<li><span>Remember what Amalec did to thee in the way when thou
camest out of Egypt:</span></li>
<li><span>How he met thee: and slew the hindmost of the army, who
sat down, being weary, when thou wast spent with hunger and labour,
and he feared not God.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore when the Lord thy God shall give thee rest, and
shall have subdued all the nations round about in the land which he
hath promised thee: thou shalt blot out his name from under heaven.
See thou forget it not.</span></li>

<li><span>And when thou art come into the land which the Lord thy
God will give thee to possess, and hast conquered it, and dwellest
in it:</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt take the first of all thy fruits, and put
then? in a basket, and shalt go to the place which the Lord thy God
shall choose, that his name may be invocated there:</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt go to the priest that shall be in those
days, and say to him: I profess this day before the Lord thy God,
that I am come into the land, for which he swore to our fathers,
that he would give it us.</span></li>
<li><span>And the priest taking the basket at thy hand, shall set
it before the altar of the Lord thy God:</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt speak thus in the sight of the Lord thy
God: The Syrian pursued my father, who went down into Egypt, and
sojourned there in a very small number, and grew into a nation
great and strong and of an infinite multitude.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Egyptians afflicted us, and persecuted us, laying
on us most grievous burdens :</span></li>
<li><span>And we cried to the Lord God of our fathers: who heard
us, and looked down upon our af</span></li>
<li><span>8iction, and labour, and distress:</span></li>
<li><span>And brought us out of Egypt with a strong hand, and a
stretched out arm, with great terror, with signs and
wonders:</span></li>
<li><span>And brought us into this place, and gave us this land
flowing with milk and honey.</span></li>
<li><span>And therefore now I offer the firstfruits of the land
which the Lord hath given me. And thou shalt leave them in the
sight of the ford thy God, adoring the Lord thy God.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt feast in all the good things which the
Lord thy God hath given thee, and thy house, thou and the Levite,
and the stranger that is with thee.</span></li>
<li><span>When thou hast made an end of tithing all thy fruits, in
the third year of tithes thou shalt give it to the Levite, and to
the stranger, and to the fatherless, and to the widow, that they
may eat within thy gates, and be filled:</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt speak thus in the sight of the Lord thy
God: I have taken that which was sanctified out of my house, and I
have given it to the Levite, and to the stranger, and to the
fatherless, and to the widow, as thou hast commanded me: I have not
transgressed thy commandments nor forgotten thy
precepts.</span></li>
<li><span>I have not eaten of them is my mourning, nor separated
them for any uncleanness, nor spent any thing of them in funerals.
I have obeyed the voice of the Lord my God, and have done all
things as thou hast commanded me.</span></li>
<li><span>Look from thy sanctuary, and thy high habitation of
heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and the land which thou hast
given us, as thou didst swear to our fathers, a land flowing with
milk and honey.</span></li>
<li><span>This day the Lord thy God hath commanded thee to do these
commandments and judgments: and to keep and fulfil them with all
thy heart, and with all thy soul.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast chosen the Lord this day to be thy God, and to
walk in his ways and keep his ceremonies, and precepts, end
judgments, and obey his command.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord hath chosen thee this day, to be his
peculiar people, as he hath spoken to thee, and to keep all his
commandments:</span></li>
<li><span>And to make thee higher than all nations which he hath
created, to his own praise, and name, and glory: that thou mayst be
a holy people of the Lord thy God, as he hath spoken.</span></li>

<li><span>And Moses with the ancients of Israel commanded the
people, saying: Keep every commandment that I command you this
day.</span></li>
<li><span>And when you are passed over the Jordan into the land
which the Lord thy God will give thee, thou shalt set up great
stones, and shalt plaster them over with plaster,</span></li>
<li><span>That thou mayst write on them all the words of this law,
when thou art passed over the Jordan: that thou mayst enter into
the land which the Lord thy God will give thee, a land flowing with
milk and honey, as he swore to thy fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore when you are passed over the Jordan, set up the
stones which I command you this day, in mount Hebal, and thou shalt
plaster them with plaster:</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt build there an altar to the Lord thy God,
of stones which iron hath not touched,</span></li>
<li><span>And of stones not fashioned nor polished: and thou shalt
offer upon it holocausts to the Lord thy God:</span></li>
<li><span>And shalt immolate peace victims, and eat there, and
feast before the Lord thy God.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of
this law plainly and clearly,</span></li>

Israel: Attend, and hear, O Israel: This day thou art made the
people of the Lord thy God.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt hear his voice, and do the commandments and
justices which I command thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses commanded the people in that day,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>These shall stand upon mount Garizim to bless the people,
when you are passed the Jordan: Simeon, Levi, Juda, Issachar,
Joseph, and Benjamin.</span></li>
<li><span>And over against them shall stand on mount Hebal to
curse: Ruben, Gad, and Aser, and Zabulon, Dan, and
Nephtali.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Levites shall pronounce, and say to all the men
of Israel with a loud voice:</span></li>
<li><span>Cursed be the man that maketh a graven and molten thing,
the abomination of the Lord, the work of the hands of artificers,
and shall put it in a secret place: and all the people shall answer
and say: Amen.</span></li>

and all the people shall say: Amen.</span></li>
<li><span>Cursed be he that removeth his neighbour's landmarks: and
all the people shall say: Amen.</span></li>

way: and all the people shall say: Amen.</span></li>

stranger, of the fatherless and the widow: and all the people shall
say: Amen.</span></li>

<li><span>Now if thou wilt hear the voice of the Lord thy God, to
do and keep all his commandments, which I command thee this day,

<li><span>Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed in the
field.</span></li>
<li><span>Blessed shall be the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of
thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the droves of thy herds,
and the folds of thy sheep.</span></li>

<li><span>Blessed shalt thou be coming in and going
out.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord shall cause thy enemies, that rise up against
thee, to fall down before thy face: one way shall they come out
against thee, and seven ways shall they flee before
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord will send forth a blessing upon thy storehouses,

fever and with cold, with burning and with heat, and with corrupted
air and with blasting, and pursue thee till thou

<li><span>The Lord strike thee with madness and blindness and fury
of mind.</span></li>
<li><span>And mayst thou grope at midday as the blind is wont to
grope in the dark, and not make straight thy ways. And mayst thou
at all times suffer wrong, and be oppressed with violence, and
mayst thou have no one to deliver thee.</span></li>

thou build a house, and not dwell therein. Mayest thou plant a
vineyard and not gather the vintage thereof.</span></li>

little: because the locusts shall consume all.</span></li>

thee, in hunger, and thirst, and nakedness, and in want of all
things: and he shall put an iron yoke upon thy neck, till he
consume thee.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord will bring upon thee a nation from afar, and
from the uttermost ends of the earth, like an eagle that flyeth
swiftly, whose tongue thou canst not understand,</span></li>
<li><span>A most insolent nation, that will shew no regard to the
ancients, nor have pity on the infant,</span></li>
<li><span>And will devour the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruits
of thy land: until thou be destroyed, and will leave thee no wheat,
nor wine, nor oil, nor herds of oxen, nor flocks of sheep: until he
destroy thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And consume thee in all thy cities, end thy strong and
high walls be brought down, wherein thou trustedst in all thy land.
Thou shalt be besieged within thy gates in all thy land which the
Lord thy God will give thee:</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt eat the fruit of thy womb, and the flesh
of thy sons and of thy daughters, which the Lord thy God shall give
thee, in the distress and extremity wherewith thy enemy shall
oppress thee.</span></li>
<li><span>The man that is nice among you, and very delicate, shall
envy his own brother, and his wife, that lieth in his
bosom,</span></li>
<li><span>So that he will not give them of the flesh of his
children, which he shall eat: because he hath nothing else in the
siege and the want, wherewith thy enemies shall distress thee
within all thy gates.</span></li>
<li><span>The tender and delicate woman, that could not go upon the
ground, nor set down her foot for over much niceness and
tenderness, will envy her husband who lieth in her bosom, the flesh
of her son, and of her daughter,</span></li>
<li><span>And the filth of the afterbirths, that come forth from
between her thighs, and the children that are born the same hour.
For they shall eat them secretly for the want of all things, in the
siege and distress, wherewith thy enemy shall oppress thee within
thy gates.</span></li>
<li><span>If thou wilt not keep, and fulfil all the words of this
law, that are written in this volume, and fear his glorious and
terrible name: that is, The Lord thy God:</span></li>

thy seed, plagues great and lasting, infirmities grievous and
perpetual.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall bring back on thee all the afflictions of
Egypt, which thou wast afraid of, and they shall stick fast to
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover the Lord will bring upon thee all the diseases,
and plagues, that are not written in the volume of this law till he
consume thee:</span></li>
<li><span>And you shall remain few in number, who before were as
the stars of heaven for multitude, because thou heardst not the
voice of the Lord thy God.</span></li>
<li><span>And as the Lord rejoiced upon you before doing good to
you, and multiplying you: so he shall rejoice destroying and
bringing you to nought, so that you shall be taken away from the
land which thou shalt go in to possess.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord shall scatter thee among all people, from the
farthest parts of the earth to the ends thereof: and there thou
shalt serve strange gods, which both thou art ignorant of and thy
fathers, wood and stone.</span></li>
<li><span>Neither shalt thou be quiet, even in those nations, nor
shall there be any rest for the sole of thy foot. For the Lord will
give thee a fearful heart, and languishing eyes, and a soul
consumed with pensiveness:</span></li>
<li><span>And thy life shall be as it were hanging before thee.
Thou shalt fear night and day, neither shalt thou trust thy
life.</span></li>
<li><span>In the morning thou shalt say: Who will grant me evening?
and at evening: Who will grant me morning? for the fearfulness of
thy heart, wherewith thou shalt be terrified, and for those things
which thou shalt see with thy eyes.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord shall bring thee again with ships into Egypt, by
the way whereof he said to thee that thou shouldst see it no more.
There shalt thou be set to sale to thy enemies for bondmen and
bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.</span></li>

<li><span>That he may raise thee up a people to himself, and he may
be thy God as he hath spoken to thee, and as he swore to thy
fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</span></li>
<li><span>Neither with you only do I make this covenant, and
confirm these oaths,</span></li>
<li><span>But with all that are present and that are
absent.</span></li>
<li><span>For you know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt, and how
we have passed through the midst of nations, and passing through
them,</span></li>
<li><span>You have seen their abominations and filth, that is to
say, their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which they
worshipped.</span></li>
<li><span>Lest perhaps there should be among you a man or a woman,
a family or a tribe, whose heart is turned away this day from the
Lord our God, to go and serve the gods of those nations: and there
should be among you a root bringing forth gall and
bitterness.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he shall hear the words of this oath, he should
bless himself in his heart saying: I shall have peace, and will
walk on in the naughtiness of my heart: and the drunken may consume
the thirsty,</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord should not forgive him: but his wrath and
jealousy against that man should be exceedingly enkindled at that
time, and all the curses that are written in this volume should
light upon him: and the Lord should blot out his name from under
heaven,</span></li>
<li><span>And utterly destroy him out of all the tribes of Israel,
according to the curses that are contained in the book of this law
and covenant:</span></li>
<li><span>And the following generation shall say, and the children
that shall be born hereafter, and the strangers that shall come
from afar, seeing the plagues of that land and the evils wherewith
the Lord hath afflicted it,</span></li>
<li><span>Burning it with brimstone, and the heat of salt, so that
it cannot be sown any more, nor any green thing grow therein, after
the example of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrha, Adama and
Seboim, which the Lord destroyed in his wrath and
indignation:</span></li>
<li><span>And all the nations shall say: Why hath the Lord done
thus to this land? what meaneth this exceeding great heat of his
wrath?</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall answer: Because they forsook the covenant
of the Lord, which he made with their fathers, when he brought them
out of the land of Egypt:</span></li>
<li><span>And they have served strange gods, and adored them, whom
they knew not, and for whom they had not been assigned:</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore the wrath of the Lord was kindled against this
land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this
volume :</span></li>
<li><span>And he hath cast them out of their land, in anger and in
wrath, and in very great indignation, and hath thrown them into a
strange land, as it is seen this day.</span></li>
<li><span>Secret things to the Lord our God: things that are
manifest, to us and to our children for ever, that we may do all
the words of this law.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="30">Deuteronomy 30</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Now when all these things shall be come upon thee, the
blessing or the curse, which I have set forth before thee, and thou
shalt be touched with repentance of thy heart among all the
nations, into which the Lord thy God shall have scattered
thee,</span></li>
<li><span>And shalt return to him, and obey his commandments, as I
command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thy heart,
and with all thy soul:</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord thy God will bring back again thy captivity, and
will have mercy on thee, and gather thee again out of all the
nations, into which he scattered thee before.</span></li>
<li><span>If thou be driven as far as the poles of heaven, the Lord
thy God will fetch thee back from thence,</span></li>
<li><span>And will take thee to himself, and bring thee into the
land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it: and
blessing thee, he will make thee more numerous than were thy
fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart
of thy seed: that then mayst love the Lord thy God with all thy
heart and with all thy soul, that thou mayst live.</span></li>
<li><span>And he will turn all these curses upon thy enemies, and
upon them that hate and persecute thee.</span></li>
<li><span>But thou shalt return, and hear the voice of the Lord thy
God, and shalt do all the commandments which I command thee this
day:</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord thy God will make thee abound in all the
works of thy hands, in the fruit of thy womb, and in the fruit of
thy cattle, in the fruitfulness of thy land, and in the plenty of
all things. For the Lord will return to rejoice over thee in all
good things, as he rejoiced in thy fathers:</span></li>
<li><span>Yet so if thou hear the voice of the Lord thy God, and
keep his precepts and ceremonies, which are written in this law:
and return to the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy
soul.</span></li>
<li><span>This commandment, that I command thee this day is not
above thee, nor far off from thee:</span></li>
<li><span>Nor is it in heaven, that thou shouldst say: Which of us
can go up to heaven to bring it unto us, and we may hear and fulfil
it in work?</span></li>
<li><span>Nor is it beyond the sea: that thou mayst excuse thyself,
and say: Which of us can cross the sea, and bring it unto us: that
we may hear, and do that which is commanded?</span></li>
<li><span>But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth and in
thy heart, that thou mayst do it.</span></li>
<li><span>Consider that I have set before thee this day life and
good, and on the other hand death and evil:</span></li>
<li><span>That thou mayst love the Lord thy God, and walk in his
ways, and keep his commandments and ceremonies and judgments, and
thou mayst live, and he may multiply thee, and bless thee in the
land, which thou shalt go in to possess.</span></li>
<li><span>But if thy heart be turned away, so that thou wilt not
hear, and being deceived with error thou adore strange gods, and
serve them:</span></li>
<li><span>I foretell thee this day that thou shalt perish, and
shalt remain but a short time in the land, to which thou shalt pass
over the Jordan, and shalt go in to possess it.</span></li>
<li><span>I call heaven and earth to witness this day, that I have
set before you life and death, blessing and cursing. Choose
therefore life, that both thou and thy seed may live:</span></li>
<li><span>And that thou mayst love the Lord thy God, and obey his
voice, and adhere to him (for he is thy life, and the length of thy
days,) that thou mayst dwell in the land, for which the Lord swore
to thy fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that he would give it
them.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="31">Deuteronomy 31</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And Moses went, and spoke all these words to all
Israel,</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to them: I am this day a hundred and twenty
years old, I can no longer go out and come in, especially as the
Lord also hath said to me: O Thou shalt not pass over this
Jordan.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord thy God then will pass over before thee: he will
destroy all these nations in thy sight, and thou shalt possess
them: and this Josue shall go over before thee, as the Lord hath
spoken.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord shall do to them as he did to Sehon and Og
the kings of the Amorrhites, and to their land, and shall destroy
them.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore when the Lord shall have delivered these also
to you, you shall do in like manner to them as I have commanded
you,</span></li>
<li><span>Do manfully and be of good heart: fear not, nor be ye
dismayed at their sight: for the Lord thy God he himself is thy
leader, and will not leave thee nor forsake thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses called Josue, and said to him before all
Israel: Take courage, and be valiant: for thou shalt bring this
people into the land which the Lord swore he would give to their
fathers, and thou shalt divide it by lot.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord who is your leader, he himself will be with
thee: he will not leave thee, nor forsake thee: fear not, neither
be dismayed.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests
the sons of Levi, who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord,
and to all the ancients of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And he commanded them, saying: After seven years, in the
year of remission, in the feast of tabernacles,</span></li>
<li><span>When all Israel come together, to appear in the sight of
the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord shall choose, thou
shalt read the words of this law before all Israel, in their
hearing,</span></li>
<li><span>And the people being all assembled together, both men and
women, children and strangers, that are within thy gates: that
hearing they may learn, and fear the Lord your God, and keep, and
fulfil all the words of this law:</span></li>
<li><span>That their children also, who now are ignorant, may hear,
and fear the Lord their God, all the days that they lire in the
land whither you are going over the Jordan to possess
it.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Behold the days of thy death
are nigh: call Josue, and stand ye in the tabernacle of the
testimony, that I may give him a charge. So Moses and Josue went
and stood in the tabernacle of the testimony:</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord appeared there in the pillar of a cloud,
which stood in the en try of the tabernacle.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Behold thou shalt sleep with
thy fathers, and this people rising up will go a fornicating after
strange gods in the land, to which it goeth in to dwell: there will
they forsake me, and will make void the covenant, which I have made
with them,</span></li>
<li><span>And my wrath shall be kindled against them in that day:
and I will forsake them, and will hide my face from them, and they
shall be devoured: all evils and afflictions shall find them, so
that they shall say in that day: In truth it is because God is not
with me, that these evils have found me.</span></li>
<li><span>But I will hide, and cover my face in that day, for all
the evils which they have done, because they have followed strange
gods..</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore write you this canticle, and teach the
children of Israel: that they may know it by heart, and sing it by
mouth, and this song may be unto me for a testimony among the
children of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>For I will bring them into the land, for which I swore to
their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey. And when they have
eaten, and are full and fat, they will turn away after strange
gods, and will serve them: and will despise me, and make void my
covenant.</span></li>
<li><span>And after many evils and afflictions shall have come upon
them, this canticle shall answer them for a testimony, which no
oblivion shall take away out of the mouth of their seed. For I know
their thoughts, and what they are about to de this day, before that
I bring them into the land which I have promised them.</span></li>
<li><span>Moses therefore wrote the canticle and taught it to the
children of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord commanded Josue the son of Nun, and said:
Take courage, and be valiant: for thou shalt bring the children of
Israel into the land which I have promised, and I will be with
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore after Moses had wrote the words of this law in
a volume, and finished it:</span></li>
<li><span>He commanded the Levites, who carried the ark of the
covenant of the Lord. saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Take this book, and put it in the side of the ark of the
covenant of the Lord your God: that it may be there for a testimony
against thee.</span></li>
<li><span>For I know thy obstinacy, and thy most stiff neck, While
I am yet living, and going in with you, you have always been
rebellious against the Lord: how much more when I shall be
dead?</span></li>
<li><span>Gather unto me all the ancients of your tribes, and your
doctors, and I will speak these words in their hearing, and will
call heaven and earth to witness against them.</span></li>
<li><span>For I know that, after my death, you will do wickedly,
and will quickly turn aside from the way that I have commanded you:
and evils shall come upon you in the latter times, when you shall
do evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him by the works of
your hands.</span></li>
<li><span>Moses therefore spoke, in the hearing of the whole
assembly of Israel, the words of this canticle, and finished it
even to the end,</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="32">Deuteronomy 32</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Hear, O ye heavens, the things I speak, let the earth
give ear to the words of my mouth.</span></li>
<li><span>Let my doctrine gather as the rain, let my speech distil
as the dew, as a shower upon the herb, and as drops upon the
grass.</span></li>
<li><span>Because I will invoke the name of the Lord: give ye
magnificence to our God.</span></li>
<li><span>The works of God are perfect, and all his ways are
judgments: God is faithful and without any iniquity, he is just and
right.</span></li>
<li><span>They have sinned against him, and are nose of his
children in their filth: they are a wicked and perverse
generation.</span></li>
<li><span>Is this the return thou makest to the Lord, O foolish and
senseless people? Is not he thy father, that hath possessed thee,
and made thee, and created thee?</span></li>
<li><span>Remember the days of old, think upon every generation:
ask thy father, and he will declare to thee: thy elders and they
will tell thee.</span></li>
<li><span>When the Most High divided the nations: when he separated
the sons of Adam, he appointed the bounds of people according to
the number of the children of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>But the Lord's portion is his people: Jacob the lot of
his inheritance.</span></li>
<li><span>He found him in a desert land, in a place of horror, and
of vast wilderness: he led him about, and taught him: and he kept
him as the apple of his eye.</span></li>
<li><span>As the eagle enticing her young to fly, and hovering over
them, he spread his wings, and hath taken him and carried him on
his shoulders.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord alone was his leader: and there was no strange
god with him.</span></li>
<li><span>He set him upon high land: that he might eat the fruits
of the fields, that he might suck honey out of the rock, and oil
out of the hardest stone,</span></li>
<li><span>Butter of the herd, and milk of the sheep with the fat of
lambs, and of the rams of the breed of Basan: and goats with the
marrow of wheat, and might drink the purest blood of the
grape.</span></li>
<li><span>The beloved grew fat, and kicked: he grew fat, and thick
and gross, he forsook God who made him, and departed from God his
saviour.</span></li>
<li><span>They provoked him by strange gods, and stirred him up to
anger, with their abominations.</span></li>
<li><span>They sacrificed to devils and not to God: to gods whom
they knew not: that were newly come up, whom their fathers
worshipped not.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast forsaken the God that beget thee, and hast
forgotten the Lord that created thee.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord saw, and was moved to wrath: because his own
sons and daughters provoked him.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said: I will hide my face from them, and will
consider what their last end shall be: for it is a perverse
generation, and unfaithful children.</span></li>
<li><span>They have provoked me with that which was no god, and
have angered me with their vanities: and I will provoke them with
that which is no people, and will vex them with a foolish
nation.</span></li>
<li><span>A fire is kindled in my wrath, and shall burn even to the
lowest hell: and shall devour the earth with her increase, and
shall burn the foundations of the mountains.</span></li>
<li><span>I will heap evils upon them, and will spend my arrows
among them.</span></li>
<li><span>They shall be consumed with famine, and birds shall
devour them with a most bitter bite: I will send the teeth of
beasts upon them, with the fury of creatures that trail upon the
ground, and of serpents.</span></li>
<li><span>Without, the sword shall lay them waste, and terror
within, both the young man and the virgin, the sucking child with
the man in years.</span></li>
<li><span>I said: Where are they? I will make the memory of them to
cease from among men.</span></li>
<li><span>But for the wrath of the enemies I have deferred it: lest
perhaps their enemies might be proud, and should say: Our mighty
hand, and not the Lord, hath done all these things.</span></li>
<li><span>They are a nation without counsel, and without
wisdom.</span></li>
<li><span>O that they would be wise and would understand, and would
provide for their last end.</span></li>
<li><span>How should one pursue after a thousand, and two chase ten
thousand? Was it not, because their God had sold them, and the Lord
had shut them up?</span></li>
<li><span>For our God is not as their gods: our enemies themselves
are judges.</span></li>
<li><span>Their vines are of the vineyard of Sodom, and of the
suburbs of Gomorrha: their grapes are grapes of gall, and their
clusters most bitter.</span></li>
<li><span>Their wine is the gall of dragons, and the venom of asps,
which is incurable.</span></li>
<li><span>Are not these things stored up with me, and sealed up in
my treasures?</span></li>
<li><span>Revenge is mine, and I will repay them in due time, that
their foot may slide: the day of destruction is at hand, and the
time makes haste to come.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord will judge his people, and will have mercy on
his servants : he shall see that their hand is weakened, and that
they who were shut up have also failed, and they that remained are
consumed.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall say: Where are their gods, in whom they
trusted?</span></li>
<li><span>Of whose victims they ate the fat, and drank the wine of
their drink offerings: let them arise and help you, and protect you
in your distress.</span></li>
<li><span>See ye that I alone am, and there is no other God besides
me: I will kill and I will make to live: I will strike, and I will
heal, and there is none that can deliver out of my
hand.</span></li>
<li><span>I will lift up my hand to heaven, and I will say: I live
for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>If I shall whet my sword as the lightning, and my hand
take hold on judgment: I will render vengeance to my enemies, and
repay them that hate me.</span></li>
<li><span>I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword
shall devour flesh, of the blood of the slain and of the captivity,
of the bare head of the enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>Praise his people, ye nations, for he will revenge the
blood of his servants: and will render vengeance to their enemies,
and he will be merciful to the land of his people.</span></li>
<li><span>So Moses came and spoke all the words of this canticle in
the ears of the people, and Josue the son of Nun.</span></li>
<li><span>And he ended all these words, speaking to all
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to them : Set your hearts on all the words,
which I testify to you this day: which you shall command your
children to observe and to do, and to fulfil all that is written in
this law:</span></li>
<li><span>For they are not commanded you in vain, but that every
one should live in them, and that doing them you may continue a
long time in the land whither you are going over the Jordan to
possess it.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses the same day,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Go up into this mountain Abarim, (that is to say, of
passages,) unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab over
against Jericho: and see the land of Chanaan, which I will deliver
to the children of Israel to possess, and die thou in the
mountain.</span></li>
<li><span>When thou art gone up into it thou shalt be gathered to
thy people, as Aaron thy brother died in mount Her, and was
gathered to his people:</span></li>
<li><span>Because you trespassed against me in the midst of the
children of Israel, at the waters of contradiction in Cades of the
desert of Sin: and you did not sanctify me among the children of
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt see the land before thee, which I will give to
the children of Israel, but thou shalt not enter into
it.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="33">Deuteronomy 33</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>This is the blessing, wherewith the man of God Moses
blessed the children of Israel, before his death.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said: The Lord came from Sinai, and from Seir he
rose up to us: he hath appeared from mount Pharan, and with him
thousands of saints. In his right hand a fiery law.</span></li>
<li><span>He hath loved the people, all the saints are in his hand:
and they that approach to his feet, shall receive of his
doctrine.</span></li>
<li><span>Moses commanded us a law, the inheritance of the
multitude of Jacob.</span></li>
<li><span>He shall be king with the most right, the princes of the
people being assembled with the tribes of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Let Ruben live, and not die, and be he small in
number.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the blessing of Juda. Hear, O Lord, the voice of
Juda, and bring him in unto his people : his hands shall fight for
him, and he shall be his helper against his enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>To Levi also he said: Thy perfection, and thy doctrine be
to thy holy man, whom thou hast proved in the temptation, and
judged at the waters of contradiction :</span></li>
<li><span>Who hath said to his father, and to his mother: I do not
know you; and to his brethren: I know you not: and their own
children they have not known. These have kept thy word, and
observed thy covenant,</span></li>
<li><span>Thy judgments, O Jacob, and thy law, O Israel: they shall
put incense in thy wrath and holocaust upon thy altar.</span></li>
<li><span>Bless, O Lord, his strength, and receive the works of his
hands. Strike the backs of his enemies, and let not them that hate
him rise.</span></li>
<li><span>And to Benjamin he said: The best beloved of the Lord
shall dwell confidently in him: as in a bride chamber shall he
abide all the day long, and between his shoulders shall be
rest.</span></li>
<li><span>To Joseph also he said: Of the blessing of the Lord be
his land, of the fruits of heaven, and of the dew, and of the deep
that lieth beneath.</span></li>
<li><span>Of the fruits brought forth by the sun and by the
moon.</span></li>
<li><span>Of the tops of the ancient mountains, of the fruits of
the everlasting hills:</span></li>
<li><span>And of the fruits of the earth, and of the fulness
thereof. The blessing of him that appeared in the bush, come upon
the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the Nazarite among his
brethren.</span></li>
<li><span>His beauty as of the firstling of a bullock, his horns as
the horns of a rhinoceros: with them shall he push the nations even
to the ends of the earth These are the multitudes of Ephraim and
these the thousands of Manasses.</span></li>
<li><span>And to Zabulon he said: Rejoice, O Zabulon, in thy going
out; and Issachar in thy tabernacles.</span></li>
<li><span>They shall call the people to the mountain: there shall
they sacrifice the victims of justice. Who shall suck as milk the
abundance of the sea, and the hidden treasures of the
sands.</span></li>
<li><span>And to Gad he said: Blessed be Gad in his breadth: he
hath rested as a lion, and hath seized upon the arm and the top of
the head.</span></li>
<li><span>And he saw his pre-eminence, that in his portion the
teacher was laid up: who was with the princes of the people, and
did the justices of the Lord, and his judgment with
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>To Dan also he said: Dan is a young lion, he shall flow
plentifully from Basan.</span></li>
<li><span>And to Nephtali he said: Nephtali shall enjoy abundance,
and shall be full of the blessings of the Lord: he shall possess
the sea and the south.</span></li>
<li><span>To Aser also he said: Let Aser be blessed with children,
let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in
oil.</span></li>
<li><span>His shoe shall be iron and brass. As the days of thy
youth, so also shall thy old age be.</span></li>
<li><span>There is no other God like the God of the rightest: he
that is mounted upon the heaven is thy helper. By his magnificence
the clouds run hither and thither.</span></li>
<li><span>His dwelling is above, and underneath are the everlasting
arms: he shall cast out the enemy from before thee, and shall say:
Be thou brought to nought.</span></li>
<li><span>Israel shall dwell in safety, and alone. The eye of Jacob
in a land of corn and wine, and the heavens shall be misty with
dew.</span></li>
<li><span>Blessed are thou, Israel: who is like to thee, O people,
that art saved by the Lord? the shield of thy help, and the sword
of thy glory: thy enemies shall deny thee, and thou shalt tread
upon their necks.</span></li>

<li><span>Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab upon mount
Nebo, to the top of Phasga over against Jericho: and the Lord
shewed him all the land of Galaad as far as Dan.</span></li>
<li><span>And all Nephtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasses,
and all the land of Juda unto the furthermost sea,</span></li>
<li><span>And the south part, and the breadth of the plain of
Jericho the city of palm trees as far as Segor.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to him: This is the land, for which I
swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying: I will give it to thy
seed. Thou hast seen it with thy eyes, and shalt not pass over to

<li><span>And Moses the servant of the Lord died there, in the land
of Moab, by the commandment of the Lord:</span></li>
<li><span>And he buried him in the valley of the land of Moab over
against Phogor: and no man hath known of his sepulchre until this

<li><span>Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died:
his eye was not dim, neither were his teeth moved.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Israel mourned for him in the plains
of Moab thirty days: and the days of their mourning in which they
mourned for Moses were ended.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josue the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of
wisdom, because Moses had laid his hands upon him. And the children
of Israel obeyed him, and did as the Lord commanded
Moses.</span></li>
<li><span>And there arose no more a prophet in Israel like unto
Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face,</span></li>

in the land of Egypt to Pharao, and to all his servants, and to his
whole land,</span></li>

did before all Israel.</span></li>
