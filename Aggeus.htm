<ol>
<li><span>In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth
month, in the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came by
the hand of Aggeus the prophet, to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel,
governor of Juda, and to Jesus the son of Josedec the high priest,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts, saying: This people saith:
The time is not yet come for building the house of the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And the word of the Lord came by the hand of Aggeus the
prophet, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Is it time for you to dwell in ceiled houses, and this
house lie desolate?</span></li>
<li><span>And now thus saith the Lord of hosts: Set your hearts to
consider your ways.</span></li>
<li><span>You have sowed much, and brought in little: you have
eaten, but have not had enough: you have drunk, but have not been
filled with drink: you have clothed yourselves, but have not been
warmed: and he that hath earned wages, put them into a bag with
holes.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Set Your hearts upon your
ways:</span></li>
<li><span>Go up to the mountain, bring timber, and build the house:
and it shall be acceptable to me, and I shall be glorified, saith
the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>You have looked for more, and behold it became less, and
you brought it home, and I blowed it away: why, saith the Lord of
hosts? because my house is desolate, and you make haste every man
to his own house.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore the heavens over you were stayed from giving
dew, and the earth was hindered from yielding her
fruits:</span></li>
<li><span>And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the
mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the wine, and upon the oil,
and upon all that the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon
beasts, and upon all the labour of the hands.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and Jesus the son of
Josedec the high priest, and all the remnant of the people
hearkened to the voice of the Lord their God, and to the words of
Aggeus the prophet, as the Lord their God sent him to them: and the
people feared before the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And Aggeus the messenger of the Lord, as one of the
messengers of the Lord, spoke, saying to the people: I am with you,
saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zorobabel the son
of Salathiel governor of Juda, and the spirit of Jesus the son of
Josedec the high priest, and the spirit of all the rest of the
people: and they went in, and did the work in the house of the Lord
of hosts their God.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>In the four and twentieth day of the month, in the sixth
month, in the second year of Darius the king, they
began.</span></li>
<li><span>And in the seventh month, the word of the Lord came by
the hand of Aggeus the prophet, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Speak to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel the governor of
Juda, and to Jesus the son of Josedec the high priest, and to the
rest of the people, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Who is left among you, that saw this house in its first
glory? and how do you see it now? is it not in comparison to that
as nothing in your eyes?</span></li>
<li><span>Yet now take courage, O Zorobabel, saith the Lord, and
take courage, O Jesus the son of Josedec the high priest, and take
courage, all ye people of the land, saith the Lord of hosts: and
perform (for I am with you, saith the Lord of hosts)</span></li>
<li><span>The word that I covenanted with you when you came out of
the land of Egypt: and my spirit shall be in the midst of you: fear
not.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord of hosts: Yet one little while,
and I will move the heaven and the earth, and the sea, and the dry
land.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will move all nations: AND THE DESIRED OF ALL
NATIONS SHALL COME: and I will fill this house with glory: saith
the Lord of hosts.</span></li>
<li><span>The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord
of hosts.</span></li>
<li><span>Great shall be the glory of this last house more than of
the first, saith the Lord of hosts: and in this place I will give
peace, saith the Lord of hosts.</span></li>
<li><span>In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the
second year of Darius the king, the word of the Lord came to Aggeus
the prophet, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Ask the priests the law,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>If a man carry sanctified flesh in the skirt of his
garment, and touch with his skirt, bread, or pottage, or wine, or
oil, or any meat: shall it be sanctified? And the priests answered,
and said: No.</span></li>
<li><span>And Aggeus said: If one that is unclean by occasion of a
soul touch any of all these things, shall it be defiled? And the
priests answered, and said: It shall be defiled.</span></li>
<li><span>And Aggeus answered, and said: So is this people, and so
is this nation before my face, saith the Lord, and so is all the
work of their hands: and all that they have offered there, shall be
defiled.</span></li>
<li><span>And now consider in your hearts, from this day and
upward, before there was a stone laid upon a stone in the temple of
the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>When you went to a heap of twenty bushels, and they
became ten: and you went into the press, to press out fifty
vessels, and they became twenty.</span></li>
<li><span>I struck you with a blasting wind, and all the works of
your hand with the mildew and with hail, yet there was none among
you that returned to me, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Set your hearts from this day, and henceforward, from the
four and twentieth day of the ninth month: from the day that the
foundations of the temple of the Lord were laid, and lay it up in
your hearts.</span></li>
<li><span>Is the seed as yet sprung up? or hath the vine, and the
fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree as yet
flourished? from this day I will bless you.</span></li>
<li><span>And the word of the Lord came a second time to Aggeus in
the four and twentieth day of the month, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Speak to Zorobabel the governor of Juda, saying: I will
move both heaven and earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and will
destroy the strength of the kingdom of the Gentiles: and I will
overthrow the chariot, and him that rideth therein: and the horses
and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his
brother.</span></li>
<li><span>In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, I will take thee, O
Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, my servant, saith the Lord, and
will make thee as a signet, for I have chosen thee, saith the Lord
of hosts.</span></li>
