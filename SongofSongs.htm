Thy name is as oil poured out: therefore young maidens have loved thee.<li>Draw me: we will run after thee to the odour of thy ointments. The king hath brought me into his storerooms: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, remembering thy breasts more than wine: the righteous love thee.<li>I am black but beautiful, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Cedar, as the curtains of Solomon.<li>Do not consider me that I am brown, because the sun hath altered my colour: the sons of my mother have fought against me, they have made me the keeper in the vineyards: my vineyard I have not kept.<li>Shew me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou liest in the midday, lest I begin to wander after the flocks of thy companions.<li>If thou know not thyself, O fairest among women, go forth, and follow after the steps of the flocks, and feed thy kids beside the tents of the shepherds.<li>To my company of horsemen, in Pharao's chariots, have I likened thee, O my love.<li>Thy cheeks are beautiful as the turtledove's, thy neck as jewels.<li>We will make thee chains of gold, inlaid with silver.<li>While the king was at his repose, my spikenard sent forth the odour thereof.<li>A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me, he shall abide between my breasts.<li>A cluster of cypress my love is to me, in the vineyards of Engaddi.<li>Behold thou art fair, O my love, behold thou art fair, thy eyes are as those of doves.<li>Behold thou art fair, my beloved, and comely. Our bed is flourishing.<li>The beams of our houses are of cedar, our rafters of cypress trees.</ol><h2><a name=2>Canticle of Canticles 2</a></h2><ol><li>I am the flower of the field, and the lily of the valleys.<li>As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.<li>As the apple tree among the trees of the woods, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow, whom I desired: and his fruit was sweet to my palate.<li>He brought me into the cellar of wine, he set in order charity in me.<li>Stay me up with flowers, compass me about with apples: because I languish with love.<li>His left hand is under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me.<li>I adjure you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and the harts of the, fields, that you stir not up, nor make the beloved to awake, till she please.<li>The voice of my beloved, behold he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping over the hills.<li>My beloved is like a roe, or a young hart. Behold he standeth behind our wall, looking through the windows, looking through the lattices.<li>Behold my beloved speaketh to me: Arise, make haste, my love, my dove, my beautiful one, and come.<li>For winter is now past, the rain is over and gone.<li>The flowers have appeared in our land, the time of pruning is come: the voice of the turtle is heard in our land:<li>The fig tree hath put forth her green figs: the vines in flower yield their sweet smell. Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come:<li>My dove in the clefts of the rock, in the hollow places of the wall, shew me thy face, let thy voice sound in my ears: for thy voice is sweet, and thy face comely.<li>Catch us the little foxes that destroy the vines: for our vineyard hath flourished.<li>My beloved to me, and I to him who feedeth among the lilies,<li>Till the day break, and the shadows retire.
