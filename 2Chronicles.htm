<ol>
<li><span>And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his
kingdom, and the Lord his God was with him, and magnified him to a
high degree.</span></li>
<li><span>And Solomon gave orders to all Israel, to the captains of
thousands, and of hundreds, and to the rulers, and to the judges of
all Israel, and the heads of the families:</span></li>
<li><span>And he went with all the multitude to the high place of
Gabaon, where was the tabernacle of the covenant of the Lord, which
Moses the servant of God made, in the wilderness.</span></li>
<li><span>For David had brought the ark of God from Cariathiarim to
the place, which he had prepared for it, and where he had pitched a
tabernacle for it, that is, in Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And the altar of brass, which Beseleel the son of Uri the
son of Hur had made, was there before the tabernacle of the Lord:
and Solomon and all the assembly sought it:</span></li>
<li><span>And Solomon went up thither to the brazen altar, before
the tabernacle of the covenant of the Lord, and offered up on it a
thousand victims.</span></li>
<li><span>And behold that night God appeared to him, saying: Ask
what thou wilt that I should give thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And Solomon said to God: Thou hast shewn great kindness
to my father David: and hast made me king in his stead.</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore, O Lord God, let thy word be fulfilled,
which thou hast promised to David my father: for thou hast made me
king over thy great people, which is as innumerable as the dust of
the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>Give me wisdom and knowledge that I may come in and go
out before thy people: for who can worthily judge this thy people,
which is so great?</span></li>
<li><span>And God said to Solomon: Because this choice hath pleased
thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, and wealth, and glory,
nor the lives of them that hate thee, nor many days of life: but
hast asked wisdom and knowledge, to be able to judge my people,
over which I have made thee king,</span></li>
<li><span>Wisdom and knowledge are granted to thee: and I will give
thee riches, and wealth, and glory, so that none of the kings
before thee, nor after thee, shall be like thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Solomon came from the high place of Gabaon to
Jerusalem before the tabernacle of the covenant, and reigned over
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And he gathered to himself chariots and horsemen, and he
had a thousand four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen:
and he placed them in the cities of the chariots, and with the king
in Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as
stones, and cedar trees as sycamores, which grow in the plains in
great multitude.</span></li>
<li><span>And there were horses brought him from Egypt, and from
Coa by the king's merchants, who went, and bought at a
price,</span></li>
<li><span>A chariot of four horses for six hundred pieces of
silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty: in like manner market
was made in all the kingdoms of the Hethites, and of the kings of
Syria.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>And Solomon determined to build a house to the name of
the Lord, and a palace for himself.</span></li>
<li><span>And he numbered out seventy thousand men to bear burdens,
and eighty thousand to hew stones in the mountains, and three
thousand six hundred to over- see them.</span></li>
<li><span>He sent also to Hiram king of Tyre, saying: As thou didst
with David my father, and didst send him cedars, to build him a
house, in which he dwelt:</span></li>
<li><span>So do with me that I may build a house to the name of the
Lord my God, to dedicate it to burn incense before him, and to
perfume with aromatical spices, and for the continual setting forth
of bread, and for the holocausts, morning and evening, and on the
sabbaths, and on the new moons, and the solemnities of the Lord our
God for ever, which are commanded for Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>For the house which I desire to build, is great: for our
God is great above all gods.</span></li>
<li><span>Who then can be able to build him a worthy house? if
heaven, and the heavens of heavens cannot contain him: who am I
that I should be able to build him a house? but to this end only,
that incense may be burnt before him.</span></li>
<li><span>Send me therefore a skilful man, that knoweth how to work
in gold, and in silver, in brass, and in iron, in purple, in
scarlet and in blue, and that hath skill in engraving, with the
artificers, which I have with me in Judea and Jerusalem, whom David
my father provided.</span></li>
<li><span>Send me also cedars, and fir trees, and pine trees from
Libanus: for I know that thy servants are skilful in cutting timber
in Libanus, and my servants shall be with thy servants,</span></li>
<li><span>To provide me timber in abundance. For the house which I
desire to build, is to be exceeding great, and
glorious.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will give thy servants the workmen that are to cut
down the trees, for their food twenty thousand cores of wheat, and
as many cores of barley, and twenty thousand measures of wine, and
twenty thousand measures of oil.</span></li>
<li><span>And Hiram king of Tyre sent a letter to Solomon, saying:
Because the Lord hath loved his people, therefore he hath made thee
king over them.</span></li>
<li><span>And he added, saying: Blessed be the Lord the God of
Israel, who made heaven and earth, who hath given to king David a
wise and knowing son, endued with understanding and prudence, to
build a house to the Lord, and a palace for himself.</span></li>
<li><span>I therefore have sent thee my father Hiram, a wise and
most skilful man,</span></li>
<li><span>The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, whose father
was a Tyrian, who knoweth how to work in gold, and in silver, in
brass, and in iron, and in marble, and in timber, in purple also,
and violet, and silk and scarlet: and who knoweth to grave all sort
of graving, and to devise ingeniously all that there may be need of
in the work with thy artificers, and with the artificers of my lord
David thy father.</span></li>
<li><span>The wheat therefore, and the barley and the oil, and the
wine, which thou, my lord, hast promised, send to thy
servants.</span></li>
<li><span>And we will cut down as many trees out of Libanus, as
thou shalt want, and will convey them in floats by sea to Joppe:
and it will be thy part to bring them thence to
Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And Solomon numbered all the proselytes in the land of
Israel, after the numbering which David his father had made, and
they were found a hundred and fifty-three thousand and six
hundred.</span></li>
<li><span>And he set seventy thousand of them to carry burdens on
their shoulders, and eighty thousand to hew stones in the
mountains: and three thousand and six hundred to be overseers of
the work of the people.</span></li>

<li><span>And Solomon began to build the house of the Lord in
Jerusalem, in mount Moria, which had been shewn to David his
father, in the place which David had prepared in the thrashingfloor
of Ornan the Jebusite.</span></li>
<li><span>And he began to build in the second month, in the fourth
year of his reign.</span></li>
<li><span>Now these are the foundations, which Solomon laid, to
build the house of God, the length by the first measure sixty
cubits, the breadth twenty cubits.</span></li>
<li><span>And the porch in the front, which was extended in length
according to the measure of the breadth of the house, twenty
cubits: and the height was a hundred and twenty cubits: and he
overlaid it within with pure gold.</span></li>
<li><span>And the greater house he ceiled with deal boards, and
overlaid them with plates of fine gold throughout: and he graved in
them palm trees, and like little chains interlaced with one
another.</span></li>
<li><span>He paved also the floor of the temple with most precious
marble, of great beauty.</span></li>
<li><span>And the gold of the plates with which he overlaid the
house, and the beams thereof, and the posts, and the walls, and the
doors was of the finest: and he graved cherubims on the
walls.</span></li>
<li><span>He made also the house of the holy of holies: the length
of it according to the breadth of the temple, twenty cubits, and
the breadth of it in like manner twenty cubits: and he overlaid it
with plates of gold, amounting to about six hundred
talents.</span></li>
<li><span>He made also nails of gold, and the weight of every nail
was fifty sicles: the upper chambers also he overlaid with
gold.</span></li>
<li><span>He made also in the house of the holy of holies two
cherubims of image work: and he overlaid them with
gold.</span></li>
<li><span>The wings of the cherubims were extended twenty cubits,
so that one wing was five cubits long, and reached to the wall of
the house: and the other was also five cubits long, and reached to
the wing of the other cherub.</span></li>
<li><span>In like manner the wing of the other cherub, was five
cubits long, and reached to the wall: and his other wing was five
cubits long, and touched the wing of the other cherub.</span></li>
<li><span>So the wings of the two cherubims were spread forth, and
were extended twenty cubits: and they stood upright on their feet,
and their faces were turned toward the house without.</span></li>
<li><span>He made also a veil of violet, purple, scarlet, and silk:
and wrought in it cherubims.</span></li>
<li><span>He made also before the doors of the temple two pillars,
which were five and thirty cubits high: and their chapiters were
five cubits.</span></li>
<li><span>He made also as it were little chains in the oracle, and
he put them on the heads of the pillars: and a hundred
pomegranates, which he put between the little chains.</span></li>
<li><span>These pillars he put at the entrance of the temple, one
on the right hand, and the other on the left: that which was on the
right hand, he called Jachin: and that on the left hand,
Boot.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="4">2 Paralipomenon 4</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>He made also an altar of brass twenty cubits long, and
twenty cubits broad, and ten cubits high.</span></li>
<li><span>1omon made in the house of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Also a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round
in compass: it was five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits
compassed it round about.</span></li>
<li><span>And under it there was the likeness of oxen, and certain
engravings on the outside of ten cubits compassed the belly of the
sea, as it were with two rows.</span></li>
<li><span>And the oxen were cast: and the sea itself was set upon
the twelve oxen, three of which looked toward the north, and other
three toward the west: and other three toward the south, and the
other three that remained toward the east, and the sea stood upon
them: and the hinder parts of the oxen were in- ward under the
sea.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the thickness of it was a handbreadth, and the brim
of it was like the brim of a cup, or of a crisped lily: and it held
three thousand measures.</span></li>
<li><span>He made also ten lavers: and he see five on the right
hand, and five on the left, to wash in them all such things as they
mere to offer for holocausts: but the sea was for the priests to
wash in.</span></li>
<li><span>And he made ten golden candlesticks, according to the
form which they were commanded to be made by: and he set them in
the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the
left.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover also ten tables: and he set them in the temple,
five on the right side, and five on the left. Also a hundred bowls
of gold.</span></li>
<li><span>He made also the court of the priests, and a great hall,
and doors in the hall, which he covered with brass.</span></li>
<li><span>And he set the sea on the right side over against the
east toward the south.</span></li>
<li><span>And Hiram made caldrons, and fleshhooks, and bowls: and
finished all the king's work in the house of God:</span></li>
<li><span>That is to say, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the
chapiters, and the network, to cover the chapiters over the
pommels.</span></li>
<li><span>And four hundred pomegranates, and two wreaths of
network, so that two rows of pomegranates were joined to each
wreath, to cover the pommels, and the chapiters of the
pillars.</span></li>
<li><span>He made also bases, and lavers, which he set upon the
bases:</span></li>
<li><span>One sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;</span></li>
<li><span>And the caldrons, and fleshhooks, and bowls. All the
vessels did Hiram his father make for Solomon in the house of the
Lord of the finest brass.</span></li>
<li><span>In the country near the Jordan did the king cast them, in
a clay ground between Sochot and Saredatha.</span></li>
<li><span>And the multitude of vessels was innumerable, so that the
weight of the brass was not known.</span></li>
<li><span>And Solomon made all the vessels for the house of God,
and the golden altar, and the tables, upon which were the leaves of
proposition,</span></li>
<li><span>The candlesticks also of most pure gold with their lamps
to give light before the oracle, according to the
manner.</span></li>
<li><span>And certain flowers, and lamps, and golden tongs: all
were made of the finest gold.</span></li>
<li><span>The vessels also for the perfumes, and the censers, and
the bowls, and the mortars, of pure gold. And he graved the doors
of the inner temple, that is, for the holy of holies: and the doors
of the temple without were of gold. And thus all the work was
finished which So</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="5">2 Paralipomenon 5</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Then Solomon brought in all the things that David his
father had vowed, the silver, and the gold, and all the vessels he
put among the treasures of the house of God.</span></li>
<li><span>And after this he gathered together the ancients of
Israel, and all the princes of the tribes, and the heads of the
families, of the children of Israel to Jerusalem, to bring the ark
of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, which is
Sion.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the men of Israel came to the king in the solemn
day of the seventh month.</span></li>
<li><span>And when all the ancients of Israel were come, the
Levites took up the ark,</span></li>
<li><span>And brought it in, together with all the furniture of the
tabernacle. And the priests with the Levites carried the vessels of
the sanctuary, which were in the tabernacle.</span></li>
<li><span>And king Solomon and all the assembly of Israel, and all
that were gathered together before the ark, sacrificed rams, and
oxen without number: so great was the multitude of the
victims.</span></li>
<li><span>And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the
Lord into its place, that is, to the oracle of the temple, into the
holy of holies under the wings of the cherubims:</span></li>
<li><span>So that the cherubims spread their wings over the place,
in which the ark was set, and covered the ark itself and its
staves.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the ends of the staves wherewith the ark was carried,
because they were some thing longer, were seen before the oracle:
but if a man were a little outward, he could not see them. So the
ark has been there unto this day.</span></li>
<li><span>And there was nothing else in the ark but the two tables
which Moses put there at Horeb when the Lord gave the law to the
children of Israel, at their coming out of Egypt.</span></li>
<li><span>Now when the priests were come out of the sanctuary, (for
all the priests that could be found there, mere sanctified: and as
yet at that time the courses and orders of the ministries were not
divided among them,)</span></li>
<li><span>Both the Levites and the singing men, that is, both they
that were under Asaph, and they that were under Heman, and they
that were under Idithun, with their sons, and their brethren,
clothed with fine linen, sounded with cymbals, and psalteries, and
harps, standing on the east side of the altar, and with them a
hundred and twenty priests, sounding with trumpets.</span></li>
<li><span>So when they all sounded together, both with trumpets,
and voice, and cymbals, and organs, and with divers kind of musical
instruments, and lifted up their voice on high : the sound was
heard afar off, so that when they began to praise the Lord, and to
say: Give glory to the Lord for he is good, for his mercy endureth
for ever: the house of God was filled with a cloud.</span></li>
<li><span>Nor could the priests stand and minister by reason of the
cloud. For the glory of the Lord had filled the house of
God.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="6">2 Paralipomenon 6</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Then Solomon said: The Lord promised that he would dwell
in a cloud.</span></li>
<li><span>But I have built a house to his name, that he might dwell
there for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king turned his face, and blessed all the
multitude of Israel (for all the multitude stood attentive) and he
said:</span></li>
<li><span>Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, who hath
accomplished in deed that which he spoke to David my father,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>From the day that I brought my people out of the land of
Egypt, I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel, for a house
to be built in it to my name: neither chose I any other man, to be
the ruler of my people Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>But I chose Jerusalem, that my name might be there: and I
chose David to set him over my people Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And whereas David my father had a mind to build a house
to the name of the Lord the God of Israel,</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord said to him: Forasmuch as it was thy will to
build a house to my name, thou hast done well indeed in having such
a will:</span></li>
<li><span>But thou shalt not build the house, but thy son, who
shall come out of thy loins, he shall build a house to my
name.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord therefore hath accomplished his word which he
spoke: and I am risen up in the place of David my father, and sit
upon the throne of Israel, as the Lord promised : and have built a
house to the name of the Lord God of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And I have put in it the ark, wherein is the covenant of
the Lord, which he made with the children of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And he stood before the altar of the I Lord, in presence
of all the multitude of Israel, and stretched forth his
hands.</span></li>
<li><span>For Solomon had made a brazen scaffold, and had set it in
the midst of the temple, which was five cubits long, and five
cubits broad, and three cubits high: and he stood upon it: then
kneeling down in the presence of all the multitude of Israel, and
lifting up his hands towards heaven,</span></li>
<li><span>He said: O Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee
in heaven nor in earth: who keepest covenant and mercy with thy
servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts:</span></li>
<li><span>Who hast performed to thy servant David my father all
that thou hast promised him: and hast accomplished in fact, what
thou hast spoken with thy mouth, as also the present time
proveth.</span></li>
<li><span>Now then, O Lord God of Israel, fulfil to thy servant
David my father, whatsoever thou hast promised him, saying: There
shall not fail thee a man in my sight, to sit upon the throne of
Israel: yet so that thy children take heed to their ways, and walk
in my law, as thou hast walked before me.</span></li>
<li><span>And now, Lord God of Israel, let thy word be established
which thou hast spoken to thy servant David.</span></li>
<li><span>Is it credible then that God should dwell with men on the
earth? If heaven and the heavens of heavens do not contain thee,
how much less this house, which I have built?</span></li>
<li><span>But to this end only it is made, that thou mayest regard
the prayer of thy servant and his supplication, O Lord my God: and
mayest hear the prayers which thy servant poureth out before
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>That thou mayest open thy eyes upon this house day and
night, upon the place wherein thou hast promised that thy name
should be called upon,</span></li>
<li><span>And that thou wouldst hear the prayer which thy servant
prayeth in it: hearken then to the prayers of thy servant, and of
thy people Israel. Whosoever shall pray in this place, hear thou
from thy dwelling place, that is, from heaven, and shew
mercy.</span></li>
<li><span>If any man sin against his neighbour, and come to swear
against him, and bind himself with a curse before the altar in this
house:</span></li>
<li><span>Then hear thou from heaven, and do justice to thy
servants, so as to requite the wicked by making his wickedness fall
upon his own head, and to revenge the just, rewarding him according
to his justice.</span></li>
<li><span>If thy people Israel be overcome by their enemies, (for
they will sin against thee,) and being converted shall do penance,
and call upon thy name, and pray to thee in this place,</span></li>
<li><span>Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy
people Israel, and bring them back into the land, which thou gavest
to them, and their fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>If the heavens be shut up, and there fall no rain by
reason of the sine of the people, and they shall pray to thee in
this place, and confess to thy name, and be converted from their
sins, when thou dost afflict them,</span></li>
<li><span>Then hear thou from heaven, O Lord, and forgive the sine
of thy servants and of thy people Israel, and teach them the good
way, in which they may walk: and give rain to thy land which thou
hast given to thy people to possess.</span></li>
<li><span>If a famine arise in the land, or a pestilence or
blasting, or mildew, or locusts, or caterpillars: or if their
enemies waste the country, and besiege the cities, whatsoever
scourge or infirmity shall be upon them:</span></li>
<li><span>Then if any of thy people Israel, knowing his own scourge
and infirmity shall pray, and shall spread forth his hands in this
house,</span></li>
<li><span>Hear thou from heaven, from thy high dwelling place, and
forgive, and render to every one according to his ways, which thou
knowest him to have in his heart: (for thou only knowest the hearts
of the children of men:)</span></li>
<li><span>That they may fear thee, and walk in thy ways all the
days that they live upon the face of the land, which thou hast
given to our fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>If the stranger also, who is not of thy people Israel,
come from a far country, for the sake of thy great name, and thy
strong hand, and thy stretched out arm, and adore in this
place:</span></li>
<li><span>Hear thou from heaven thy firm dwelling place, and do all
that which that stranger shall call upon thee for: that all the
people of the earth may know thy name, and may fear thee, as thy
people Israel, and may know, that thy name is invoked upon this
house, which I have built.</span></li>
<li><span>If thy people go out to war against their enemies, by the
way that thou shalt send them, and adore thee towards the way of
this city, which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built
to thy name:</span></li>
<li><span>Then hear thou from heaven their prayers, and their
supplications, and revenge them.</span></li>
<li><span>And if they sin against thee (for there is no man that
sinneth not) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them up to
their enemies, and they lead them away captive to a land either
afar off, or near at hand,</span></li>
<li><span>And if they be converted in their heart in the land to
which they were led / captive, and do penance, and pray to thee in
the land of their captivity, saying: We have sinned, we have done
wickedly, we have dealt unjustly:</span></li>
<li><span>And return to thee with all their heart, and with all
their soul, in the land of their captivity, to which they were led
away, and adore thee towards the way of their own land which thou
gavest their fathers, and of the city, which thou hast chosen, and
the house which I have built to thy name:</span></li>
<li><span>Then hear thou from heaven, that is, from thy firm
dwelling place, their prayers, and do judgment, and forgive thy
people, although they have sinned:</span></li>
<li><span>For thou art my God: let thy eyes, I beseech thee, be
open, and let thy ears be attentive to the prayer, that is made in
this place.</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore arise, O Lord God, into thy resting place,
thou and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O Lord God, put
on salvation, and thy saints rejoice in good things.</span></li>
<li><span>O Lord God, turn not away the face of thy anointed:
remember the mercies of David thy servant.</span></li>

<li><span>And when Solomon had made an end of his prayer, Are came
down from heaven, and consumed the holocausts and the victims: and
the majesty of the Lord tilled the house.</span></li>
<li><span>Neither could the priests enter into the temple of the
Lord, because the majesty of the Lord had filled the temple of the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover all the children of Israel saw the fire coming
down, and the glory of the Lord upon the house: and falling down
with their faces to the ground, upon the stone pavement, they
adored and praised the Lord: because he is good, because his mercy
endureth for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king and all the people sacrificed victims before
the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two
thousand oxen, and one hundred and twenty thousand rams: and the
king and all the people dedicated the house of God.</span></li>
<li><span>And the priests stood in their offices: and the Levites
with the instruments of music of the Lord, which king David made to
praise the Lord: because his mercy endureth for ever, singing the
hymns of David by their ministry: and the priests sounded with
trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.</span></li>
<li><span>Solomon also sanctified the middle of the court before
the temple of the Lord: for he offered there the holocausts, and
the fat of the peace offerings: because the brazen altar, which he
had made, could not hold the holocausts and the sacrifices and the
fat:</span></li>
<li><span>And Solomon kept the solemnity at that time seven days,
and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the
entrance of Emath to the torrent of Egypt.</span></li>
<li><span>And he made on the eighth day a solemn assembly, because
he had kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and had
celebrated the solemnity seven days.</span></li>
<li><span>So on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he
sent away the people to their dwellings, joyful and glad for the
good that the Lord had done to David, and to Solomon, and to all
Israel his people.</span></li>
<li><span>And Solomon finished the house of the Lord, and the
king's house, and all that he had designed in his heart to do, in
the house of the Lord, and in his own house, and he
prospered.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord appeared to him by night, and said : I have
heard thy prayer, and I have chosen this place to myself for a
house of sacrifice.</span></li>
<li><span>If I shut up heaven, and there fall no rain, or if I give
orders, and command the locust to devour the land, or if I send
pestilence among my people:</span></li>
<li><span>And my people, upon whom my name is called, being
converted, shall make supplication to me, and seek out my face, and
do penance for their most wicked ways: then will I hear from
heaven, and will forgive their sine and will heal their
land.</span></li>
<li><span>My eyes also shall be open, and my ears attentive to the
prayer of him that shall pray in this place.</span></li>
<li><span>For I have chosen, and have sanctified this place, that
my name may be there for ever, and my eyes and my heart may remain
there perpetually.</span></li>
<li><span>And as for thee, if thou walk before me, as David thy
father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee,
and keep my justices and my judgments :</span></li>
<li><span>I will raise up the throne of thy kingdom, as I promised
to David thy father, saying: There shall not fail thee a man of thy
stock to be ruler in Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>But if you turn away, and forsake my justices, and my
commandments which I have set before you, and shall go and serve
strange gods, and adore them,</span></li>
<li><span>I will pluck you up by the root out of my land which I
have given you: and this house which I have sanctified to my name,
I will cast away from before my face, and will make it a byword,
and an example among all nations.</span></li>
<li><span>And this house shall be for a proverb to all that pass
by, and they shall be astonished and say: Why hath the Lord done
thus to this land, and to this house?</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall answer: Because they forsook the Lord the
God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt,
and laid hold on strange gods, and adored them, and worshipped
them: therefore all these evils are come upon them.</span></li>

<li><span>And at the end of twenty years after Solomon had built
the house of the Lord and his own house:</span></li>
<li><span>He built the cities which Hiram had given to Solomon, and
caused the children of Israel to dwell there.</span></li>
<li><span>He went also into Emath Suba, and possessed
it.</span></li>
<li><span>And he built Palmira in the desert, and he built other
strong cities in Emath.</span></li>
<li><span>And he built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon the
nether, walled cities with Rates and bars and locks.</span></li>
<li><span>Balaath also and all the strong cities that were
Solomon's, and all the cities of the chariots, and the cities of
the horsemen. All that Solomon had a mind, and designed, he built
in Jerusalem and in Libanus, and in all the land of his
dominion.</span></li>
<li><span>All the people that were left of the Hethites, and the
Amorrhites, and the Pherezites, and the Hevites, and the Jebusites,
that were not of the stock of Israel:</span></li>
<li><span>Of their children, and of the posterity, whom the
children of Israel had not slain, Solomon made to be the
tributaries, unto this day.</span></li>
<li><span>But of the children of Israel he set none to serve in the
king's works: for they were men of war, and chief captains, and
rulers of his chariots and horsemen.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the chief captains of king Solomon's army were
two hundred and fifty, who taught the people.</span></li>
<li><span>And he removed the daughter of Pharao from the city of
David, to the house which he had built for her. For the king said:
My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, for
it is sanctified: because the ark of the Lord came into
it.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Solomon offered holocausts to the Lord upon the
altar of the Lord which he had built before the porch,</span></li>
<li><span>That every day an offering might be made on it according
to the ordinance of Moses, in the sabbaths, and on the new moons,
and on the festival days three times a year, that is to say, in the
feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the
feast of tabernacles.</span></li>
<li><span>And he appointed according to the order of David his
father the offices of the priests in their ministries: and the
Levites in their order to give praise, and minister before the
priests according to the duty of every day: and the porters in
their divisions by gate and gate: for so David the man of God had
commanded.</span></li>
<li><span>And the priests and Levites departed not from the king's
commandments, as to any thing that he had commanded, and as to the
keeping of the treasures.</span></li>
<li><span>Solomon had all charges prepared, from the day that he
founded the house of the Lord, until the day wherein he finished
it.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Solomon went to Asiongaber, and to Ailath, on the
coast of the Red Sea, which is in the land of Edom.</span></li>
<li><span>And Hiram sent him ships by the hands of his servants,
and skilful mariners, and they went with Solomon's servants to
Ophir, and they took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold,
and brought it to king Solomon.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="9">2 Paralipomenon 9</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And when the queen of Saba heard of the fame of Solomon,
she came to try him with hard questions at Jerusalem, with great
riches, and camels, which carried spices, and abundance of gold,
and precious stones. And when she was come to Solomon, she proposed
to him all that was in her heart.</span></li>
<li><span>And Solomon explained to her all that she proposed: and
there was not any thing that he did not make clear unto
her.</span></li>
<li><span>And when she had seen these things, to wit, the wisdom of
Solomon, and the house which he had built,</span></li>
<li><span>And the meats of his table, and the dwelling places of
his servants, and the attendance of his officers, and their
apparel, his cupbearers also, and their garments, and the victims
which he offered in the house of the Lord: there was no more spirit
in her, she was so astonished.</span></li>
<li><span>And she add to the king: The word is true which I heard
in my country of thy virtues and wisdom.</span></li>
<li><span>I did not believe them that told it, until I came, and my
eyes had seen, and I had proved that scarce one half of thy wisdom
had been told me: thou hast exceeded the same with thy
virtues.</span></li>
<li><span>Happy are thy men, and happy are thy servants, who stand
always before thee, and hear thy wisdom.</span></li>
<li><span>Blessed be the Lord thy God, who hath been pleased to set
thee on his throne, king of the Lord thy God. Because God loveth
Israel, and will preserve them for ever: therefore hath he made
thee king over them, to do judgment and justice.</span></li>
<li><span>And she gave to the king a hundred and twenty talents of
gold, and spices in great abundance, and most precious stones:
there were no such spices as these which the queen of Saba gave to
king Solomon.</span></li>
<li><span>And the servants also of Hiram, with the servants of
Solomon, brought gold from Ophir, and thyine trees, and most
precious stones:</span></li>
<li><span>And the king made of the thyine trees stairs in the house
of the Lord, and in the king's house, and harps and psalteries for
the singing men: never were there seen such trees in the land of
Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>And king Solomon gave to the queen of Saba all that she
desired, and that she asked, and many more things than she brought
to him: so she returned, and went to her own country with her
servants.</span></li>
<li><span>And the weight of the gold, that was brought to Solomon
every year, was six hundred and sixty-six talents of
gold:</span></li>
<li><span>Beside the sum which the deputies of divers nations, and
the merchants were accustomed to bring, and all the kings of
Arabia, and the lords of the lands, who I brought gold and silver
to Solomon.</span></li>
<li><span>And king Solomon made two hundred golden spears, of the
sum of six hundred pieces of gold, which went to every
spear:</span></li>
<li><span>And three hundred golden shields of three hundred pieces
of gold, which went to the covering of every shield: and the king
put them in the armoury, which was compassed with a
wood.</span></li>
<li><span>The king also made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid
it with pure gold.</span></li>
<li><span>And six steps to go up to the throne, and a footstool of
gold, and two arms one on either side, and two lions standing by
the arms:</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover twelve other little lions standing upon the
steps on both sides: there was not such a throne in any
kingdom.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the vessels of the king's table were of gold, and
the vessels of the house of the forest of Libanus were of the
purest gold. For no account was made of silver in those
days.</span></li>
<li><span>For the king's ships went to Tharsis with the servants of
Hiram, once in three years: and they brought thence gold and
silver, and ivory, and apes, and peacocks.</span></li>
<li><span>And Solomon was magnified above all the kings of the
earth for riches and glory.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the kings of the earth desired to see the face of
Solomon, that they might hear the wisdom which God had given in his
heart.</span></li>
<li><span>And every year they brought him presents, vessels of
silver and of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, and
horses, and mules.</span></li>
<li><span>And Solomon had forty thousand horses in the stables, and
twelve thousand chariots, and horsemen, and he placed them in the
cities of the chariots, and where the king was in
Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And he exercised authority over all the kings from the
river Euphrates to the land of the Philistines, and to the borders
of Egypt.</span></li>
<li><span>And he made silver as plentiful in Jerusalem as stones:
and cedars as common as the sycamores, which grow in the
plains.</span></li>
<li><span>And horses were brought to him out of Egypt, and out of
all countries.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the rest of the acts of Solomon first and last are
written in the words of Nathan the prophet, and in the boobs of
Ahias the Silonite, and in the vision of Addo the seer, against
Jeroboam the son of Nabat.</span></li>
<li><span>And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty
years.</span></li>
<li><span>And he slept d with his fathers: and they buried him in
the city of David: and Roboam his son reigned in his
stead</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="10">2 Paralipomenon 10</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And Roboam went to Sichem: for thither all Israel were
assembled, to make him king.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Jeroboam the son of Nabat, who was in Egypt,
(for he was fled thither from Solomon,) heard it, forthwith he
returned.</span></li>
<li><span>And they sent for him, and he came with all Israel, and
they spoke to Roboam, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thy father oppressed us with a most grievous yoke, do
thou govern us with a lighter hand than thy father, who laid upon
us a heavy servitude, and ease some thing of the burden, that we
may serve thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to them: Come to me again after three days.
And when the people were gone,</span></li>
<li><span>He took counsel with the ancients, who had stood before
his father Solomon, while he yet lived, saying: What counsel give
you to me, that I may answer the people?</span></li>
<li><span>And they said to him: If thou please this people, and
soothe them with kind words, they will be thy servants for
ever.</span></li>
<li><span>But he forsook the counsel of the ancients, end began to
treat with the young men, that had been brought up with him, and
were in his train.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to them: What seemeth good to you? or what
shall I answer this people, who have said to me: Ease the yoke
which thy father laid upon us?</span></li>
<li><span>But they answered as young men, and brought up with him
in pleasures, and said: Thus shalt thou speak to the people, that
said to thee: Thy father made our yoke heavy, do thou ease it: thus
shalt thou answer them: My little finger is thicker than the loins
of my father.</span></li>
<li><span>My father laid upon you a heavy yoke, and I will add more
weight to it: my father beat you with scourges, but I will beat you
with scorpions.</span></li>
<li><span>So Jeroboam, and all the people came to Roboam the third
day, as he commanded them.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king answered roughly, leaving the counsel of the
ancients.</span></li>
<li><span>And he spoke according to the advice of the young men :
My father laid upon you a heavy yoke, which I will make heavier: my
father beat you with scourges, but I will beat you with
scorpions.</span></li>
<li><span>And he condescended not to the people's requests: for it
was the will of God, that his word might be fulfilled which he had
spoken by the hand of Ahias the Silonite to Jeroboam the son of
Nabat.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the people upon the king's speaking roughly, said
thus unto him: We have no part in David, nor inheritance in the son
of Isai. Return to thy dwellings, O Israel, and do thou, O David,
feed thy own house. And Israel went away to their
dwellings.</span></li>
<li><span>But Roboam reigned over the children of Israel that dwelt
in the cities of Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>And king Roboam sent Aduram, who was over the tributes,
and the children of Israel stoned him, and he died: and king Roboam
made haste to gee up into his chariot, and fled into
Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And Israel revolted from the house of David unto this
day.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="11">2 Paralipomenon 11</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And Roboam came to Jerusalem, and called together all the
house of Juda and of Benjamin, a hundred and fourscore thousand
chosen men and warriors, to fight against Israel, and to bring back
his kingdom to him.</span></li>
<li><span>And the word of the Lord came to Semeias the man of God,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Speak to Roboam the son of Solomon the king of Juda, and
to all Israel, in Juda and Benjamin:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: You shall not go up, nor fight
against your brethren: let every man return to his own house, for
by my will this thing has been done. And when they heard the word
of the Lord, they returned, and did not go against
Jeroboam,</span></li>
<li><span>And Roboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built walled cities in
Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>And he built Bethlehem, and Etam, and Thecue,</span></li>
<li><span>And Bethsur, and Socho, and Odollam,</span></li>
<li><span>And Geth, and Maresa, and Ziph,</span></li>
<li><span>And Aduram, and Lachis, and Azecha,</span></li>
<li><span>Saraa also, and Aialon, and Hebron, which are in Juda and
Benjamin, well fenced cities.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he had enclosed them with walls, he put in them
governors and storehouses of provisions, that is, of oil and of
wine.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover in every city he made an armoury of shields and
spears, and he fortified them with great diligence, and he reigned
over Juda, and Benjamin,</span></li>
<li><span>And the priests and Levites, that were in all Israel,
came to him out of all their seats,</span></li>
<li><span>Leaving their suburbs, and their possessions, and passing
over to Juda, and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons had cast
them off, from executing the priestly office to the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And he made to himself priests for the high places, and
for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover out of all the tribes of Israel, whosoever gave
their heart to seek the Lord the God of Israel, came into Jerusalem
to sacrifice their victims be- fore the Lord the God of their
fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>And they strengthened the kingdom of Juda, and
established Roboam the son of Solomon for three years: for they
walked in the ways of David and of Solomon, only three
years.</span></li>
<li><span>And Roboam took to wife Mahalath, the daughter of
Jerimoth the son of David: and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the
son of Isai.</span></li>
<li><span>And they bore him sons Jehus, and Somorias, and
Zoom.</span></li>
<li><span>And after her he married Maacha the daughter of Absalom,
who bore him Abia and Ethai, and Ziza, and Salomith.</span></li>
<li><span>And Roboam loved Maacha the daughter of Absalom above all
his wives, and concubines: for he had married eighteen wives, and
threescore concubines: and he beget eight and twenty sons, and
threescore daughters.</span></li>
<li><span>But he put at the head of them Abia the son of Maacha to
be the chief ruler over all his brethren: for he meant to make him
king,</span></li>
<li><span>Because he was wiser and mightier than all his sons, and
in all the countries of Juda, and of Benjamin, and in all the
walled cities: and he gave them provisions in abundance, and he
sought many wives.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="12">2 Paralipomenon 12</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And when the kingdom of Roboam was strengthened and
fortified, he forsook the law of the Lord, and all Israel with
him.</span></li>
<li><span>And in the fifth year of the reign of Roboam, Sesac king
of Egypt came up against Jerusalem (because they had sinned against
the Lord)</span></li>
<li><span>With twelve hundred chariots and threescore thousand
horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out
of Egypt, to wit, Libyans, and Troglodites, and
Ethiopians.</span></li>
<li><span>And he took the strongest cities in Juda, and came to
Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And Semeias the prophet came to Roboam, and to the
princes of Juda, that were gathered together in Jerusalem, fleeing
from Sesac, and he said to them : Thus saith the Lord: You have
left me, and I have left you in the hand of Sesac.</span></li>
<li><span>And the princes of Israel, and the king, being in a
consternation, said: The Lord is just.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the Lord saw that they were humbled, the word of
the Lord came to Semeias, saying: Because they are humbled, I will
not destroy them, and I will give them a little help, and my wrath
shall not fall upon Jerusalem by the hand of Sesac.</span></li>
<li><span>But yet they shall serve him, that they may know the
difference between my service, and the service of a kingdom of the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>So Sesac king of Egypt departed from Jerusalem, taking
away the treasures of the house of the Lord, and of the king's
house, and he took all with him, and the golden shields that
Solomon had made,</span></li>
<li><span>Instead of which the king made brazen ones, and delivered
them to the captains of the shieldbearers, who guarded the entrance
of the palace.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the king entered into the house of the Lord, the
shieldbearers came and took them, and brought them back again to
their armoury.</span></li>
<li><span>But yet because they were humbled, the wrath of the Lord
turned away from them, and they were not utterly destroyed: for
even in Juda there were found good works.</span></li>
<li><span>King Roboam therefore was strengthened in Jerusalem, and
reigned: he was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and
he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord
chose out of all the tribes of Israel, to establish his name there:
and the name of his mother was Naama an Ammonitess.</span></li>
<li><span>But he did evil, and did not prepare his heart to seek
the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the acts of Roboam first and last are written in the
books of Semeias the prophet, and of Addo the seer, and diligently
recorded: and there was war between Roboam and Jeroboam all their
days.</span></li>
<li><span>And Roboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the
city of David. And Abia his son reigned in his stead.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="13">2 Paralipomenon 13</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>In the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam, Abia reigned
over Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>Three years he reigned in Jerusalem, and his mother's
name was Michaia, the daughter of Uriel of Gabaa: and there was war
between Abia and Jeroboam.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Abia had begun battle, and had with him four
hundred thou- sand most valiant and chosen men, Jeroboam put his
army in array against him, eight hundred thousand men, who were
also chosen and most valiant for war.</span></li>
<li><span>And Abia stood upon mount Semeron, which was in Ephraim,
and said: Hear me, O Jeroboam, and all Israel:</span></li>
<li><span>Do you not know that the Lord God of Israel gave to David
the kingdom over Israel for ever, to him and to his sons by a
covenant of salt?</span></li>
<li><span>And Jeroboam the son of Nabat, the servant of Solomon the
son of David, rose up: m and rebelled against his lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And there were gathered to him vain men, and children of
Belial: and they prevailed against Roboam the son of Solomon: for
Roboam was unexperienced, and of a fearful heart, and could not
resist them.</span></li>
<li><span>And now you say that you are able to withstand the
kingdom of the Lord, which he possesseth by the sons of David, and
you have a great multitude of people, and golden calves, which
Jeroboam hath made you for gods.</span></li>
<li><span>And you have cast out the priests of the Lord, the sons
of Aaron, and the Levites: and you have made you priests, like all
the nations of the earth: whosoever cometh and consecrateth his
hand with a bullock of the herd, and with seven rams, is made a
priest of those who are no gods.</span></li>
<li><span>But the Lord is our God, whom we forsake not, and the
priests who minister to the Lord are the sons of Aaron, and the
Levites are in their order.</span></li>
<li><span>And they offer holocausts to the Lord, every day, morning
and evening, and incense made according to the ordinance of the
law, and the leaves are set forth on a most clean table, and there
is with us the golden candlestick, and the lamps thereof, to be
lighted always in the evening: for we keep the precepts of the Lord
our God, whom you have forsaken.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore God is the leader in our army, and his priests
who sound with trumpets, and resound against you: O children of
Israel, fight not against the Lord the God of your fathers, for it
is not good for you.</span></li>
<li><span>While he spoke these things, Jeroboam caused an
ambushment to come about behind him. And while he stood facing the
enemies, he encompassed Juda. who perceived it not, with his
army.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Juda looked back, they saw the battle coming
upon them both before and behind, and they cried to the Lord: and
the priests began to sound with the trumpets.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the men of Juda shouted: and behold when they
shouted, God terrified Jeroboam, and all Israel that stood against
Abia and Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Israel fled before Juda, and the Lord
delivered them into their hand.</span></li>
<li><span>And Abia and his people slew them with a great slaughter,
and there fell wounded of Israel five hundred thousand valiant
men.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Israel were brought down, at that
time, and the children of Juda were exceedingly strengthened,
because they had trusted in the Lord the God of their
fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>And Abia pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from
him, Bethel and her daughters, and Jesana with her daughters,
Ephron also and her daughters.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jeroboam was not able to resist any more, in the days
of Abia: and the Lord struck him, and he died.</span></li>
<li><span>But Abia, being strengthened in his kingdom, took
fourteen wives: and begot two and twenty sons, and sixteen
daughters.</span></li>
<li><span>And the rest of the acts of Abia, and of his ways and
works, are written diligently in the book of Addo the
prophet.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="14">2 Paralipomenon 14</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And Abia slept with his fathers, and they buried him in
the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead: in his
days the land was quiet ten years.</span></li>
<li><span>And Asa did that which was good and pleasing in the sight
of his God, and he destroyed the altars of foreign worship, and the
high places.</span></li>
<li><span>And broke the statues, and cut down the
groves.</span></li>
<li><span>And he commanded Juda to seek the Lord the God of their
fathers, and to do the law, and all the commandments.</span></li>
<li><span>And he took away out of all the cities of Juda the
altars, and temples, and reigned in peace.</span></li>
<li><span>He built also strong cities in Juda, for he was quiet,
and there had no wars risen in his time, the Lord giving
peace.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to Juda: Let us build these cities, and
compass them with walls, and fortify them with towers, and gates,
and bars, while all is quiet from wars, because we have sought the
Lord the God of our fathers, and he hath given us peace round
about. So they built, and there was no hinderance in
building.</span></li>
<li><span>And Asa had in his army of men that bore shields and
spears of Juda three hundred thousand, and of Benjamin that bore
shields and drew bows, two hundred and eighty thousand, all these
were most valiant men.</span></li>
<li><span>And Zara the Ethiopian came out against them with his
army of ten hundred thousand men, and with three hundred chariots:
and he came as far as Maresa.</span></li>
<li><span>And Asa went out to meet him, and set his army in array
for battle in the vale of Sephata, which is near
Maresa:</span></li>
<li><span>And he called upon the Lord God, and said: O Lord, there
is no difference with thee, whether thou help with few, or with
many: help us, O Lord our God: for with confidence in thee, and in
thy name, we are come against this multitude. O Lord thou art our
God, let not man prevail against thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord terrified the Ethiopians before Asa and
Juda: and the Ethiopians fled.</span></li>
<li><span>And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them to
Gerara: and the Ethiopians fell even to utter destruction, for the
Lord slew them, and his army fought against them, and they were
destroyed. And they took abundance of spoils,</span></li>
<li><span>And they took all the cities round about Gerara: for a
great fear was come upon all men: and they pillaged the cities, and
carried off much booty.</span></li>
<li><span>And they destroyed the sheepcotes, and took an infinite
number of cattle, and of camels: and returned to
Jerusalem.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>And the spirit of God came upon Azarias the son of
Oded,</span></li>
<li><span>And he went out to meet Asa, and said to him: Hear ye me,
Asa, and all Juda and Benjamin: The Lord is with you, because you
have been with him. If you seek him, you shall find: but if you
forsake him, he will forsake you.</span></li>
<li><span>And many days shall pass in Israel without the true God,
and without a priest a teacher, and without the law.</span></li>
<li><span>And when in their distress they shall return to the Lord
the God of Israel, and shall seek him, they shall find
him.</span></li>
<li><span>At that time there shall be no peace to him that goeth
out and cometh in, but terrors on every side among all the
inhabitants of the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>For nation shall fight against nation, and city against
city, for the Lord will trouble them with all distress.</span></li>
<li><span>Do you therefore take courage, and let not your hands he
weakened: for there shall be a reward for your work.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Asa had heard the words, and the prophecy of
Azarias the son of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and took away
the idols out of all the land of Juda, and out of Benjamin, and out
of the cities of mount Ephraim, which he had taken, and he
dedicated the altar of the Lord, which was before the porch of the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And he gathered together all Juda and Benjamin, and the
strangers with them of Ephraim, and Manasses, and Simeon: for many
were come over to him out of Israel, seeing that the Lord his God
was with him.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they were come to Jerusalem in the third month,
in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa,</span></li>
<li><span>They sacrificed to the Lord in that day of the spoils,
and of the prey, that they had brought, seven hundred oxen, and
seven thousand rams.</span></li>
<li><span>And he went in to confirm as usual the covenant, that
they should seek the Lord the God of their fathers with all their
heart, and with all their soul.</span></li>
<li><span>And if any one, said he, seek not the Lord the God of
Israel, let him die, whether little or great, man or
woman.</span></li>
<li><span>And they swore to the Lord with a loud voice with joyful
shouting, and with sound of trumpet, and sound of
comets,</span></li>
<li><span>All that mere in Juda with a curse: for with all their
heart they swore, and with all their will they sought him, and they
found him, and the Lord gave them rest round about.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover Maacha the mother of king Asa he deposed from
the royal authority, because she had made in a grove an idol of
Priapus: and he entirely destroyed it, and breaking it into pieces,
burnt it at the torrent Cedron.</span></li>
<li><span>But high places were left in Israel: nevertheless the
heart of Asa was perfect all his days.</span></li>
<li><span>And the things which his father had vowed, and he himself
had vowed, he brought into the house of the Lord, gold and silver,
and vessels of divers uses.</span></li>
<li><span>And there was no war unto the five and thirtieth year of
the kingdom of Asa.</span></li>

<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="16">2 Paralipomenon 16</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And in the six and thirtieth year of his kingdom, Baasa
the king of Israel came up against Juda, and built a wall about
Rama, that no one might safely go out or come in of the kingdom of
Asa.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures
of the house of the Lord, and of the king's treasures, and sent to
Benadad king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>There is a league between me and thee, as there was
between my father and thy father, wherefore I have sent thee silver
and gold, that thou mayst break thy league with Baasa king of
Israel, and make him depart from me.</span></li>
<li><span>And then Benadad heard this, he sent the captains of his
armies against the cities of Israel: and they took Ahion, and Dan,
and Abelmaim, and all the walled cities of Nephtali.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Baasa heard of it, he left off the building of
Rama, and interrupted his work.</span></li>
<li><span>Then king Asa took all Juda, and they carried away from
Rama the stones, and the timber that Baasa had prepared for the
building: and he built with them Gabaa, and Maspha.</span></li>
<li><span>At that time Hanani the prophet came to Asa king of Juda,
and said to him: Because thou hast had confidence in the king of
Syria, and not in the Lord thy God, therefore hath the army of the
king of Syria escaped out of thy hand.</span></li>
<li><span>Were not the Ethiopians, and the Libyans much more
numerous in chariots, and horsemen, and an exceeding great
multitude: yet because thou trustedst in the Lord, he delivered
them into thy hand?</span></li>
<li><span>For the eyes of the Lord behold all the earth, and give
strength to those who with a perfect heart trust in him. Wherefore
thou hast done foolishly, and for this cause from this time wars
shall arise against thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And Asa was angry with the seer, and commanded him to be
put in prison: for he was greatly enraged because of this thing:
and he put to death many of the people at that time.</span></li>
<li><span>But the works of Asa the first and last are written in
the book of the kings of Juda and Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And Asa fell sick in the nine and thirtieth year of his
reign, of a most violent pain in his feet, and yet in his illness
he did not seek the Lord, but rather trusted in the skill of
physicians.</span></li>
<li><span>And he slept with his fathers: and he died in the one and
fortieth year of his reign.</span></li>
<li><span>And they buried him in his own sepulchre, which he had
made for himself in the city of David: and they laid him on his bed
full of spices and odoriferous ointments, which were made by the
art of the perfumers, and they burnt them over him with very great
pomp.</span></li>

<li><span>And Josaphat his son reigned in his stead, and grew
strong against Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And he placed numbers of soldiers in all the fortified
cities of Juda. And he put garrisons in the land of Juda, and in
the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord was with Josaphat, because he walked in the
first ways of David his father: and trusted not in
Baalim,</span></li>
<li><span>But in the God of his father, and walk in his
commandments, and not according to the sins of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord established the kingdom in his hand, and all
Juda brought presents to Josaphat: and he acquired immense riches,
and much glory.</span></li>
<li><span>And when his heart had taken courage for the ways of the
Lord, he took away also the high places and the groves out of
Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>And in the third year of his reign, he sent of his
princes Benhail, and Abdias, and Zacharias, and Nathanael, and
Micheas, to teach in the cities of Juda:</span></li>
<li><span>And with them the Levites, Semeias, end Nathanias, and
Zabadias, and Asael, and Semiramoth, and Jonathan, and Adonias, and
Tobias, and Thobadonias Levites, and with them Elisama, and Joram
priests.</span></li>
<li><span>And they taught the people in Juda, having with them the
book of the law of the Lord: and they went about all the cities of
Juda, and instructed the people.</span></li>
<li><span>And the fear of the Lord came upon all the kingdoms of
the lands that were round about Juda, and they durst not make war
against Josaphat.</span></li>
<li><span>The Philistines also brought presents to Josaphat, and
tribute in silver, and the Arabians brought him cattle, seven
thousand seven hundred rams, and as many he goats.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josaphat grew, and became exceeding great: and he
built in Juda houses like towers, and walled cities.</span></li>
<li><span>And he prepared many works in the cities of Juda: and he
had warriors, and valiant men in Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>Of whom this is the number of the houses and families of
every one: in Juda captains of the army, Ednas the chief, and with
him three hundred thousand most valiant men.</span></li>
<li><span>After him Johanan the captain, and with him two hundred
and eighty thousand.</span></li>
<li><span>And after him was Amasias the son of Zechri, consecrated
to the Lord, and with him were two hundred thousand valiant
men.</span></li>
<li><span>After him was Eliada valiant in battle, and with him two
hundred thousand armed with bow and shield.</span></li>
<li><span>After him also was Jozabad, and with him a hundred and
eighty thousand ready for war.</span></li>
<li><span>All these were at the hand of the king, beside others,
whom he had put in the walled cities, in all Juda.</span></li>

<li><span>Now Josaphat was rich and very glorious, and was joined
by affinity to Achab.</span></li>
<li><span>And he went down to him after some years to Samaria: and
Achab at his coming killed sheep and oxen in abundance for him and
the people that came with him: and he persuaded him to go up to
Ramoth Galaad.</span></li>
<li><span>And Achab king of Israel said to Josaphat king of Juda:
Come with me to Ramoth Galaad. And he answered him: Thou art as I
am, and my people as thy people, and we will be with thee in the
war.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josaphat said to the king of Israel: Inquire, I
beseech thee, at present the word of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>So the king of Israel gathered together of the prophets
four hundred men, and he said to them: Shall we go to Ramoth Galaad
to fight, or shall we forbear ? But they said: Go up, and God will
deliver it into the king's hand.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josaphat said: Is there not here a prophet of the
Lord, that we may inquire also of him?</span></li>
<li><span>And the king of Israel said to Josaphat: There is one
man, of whom we may ask the will of the Lord: but I hate him, for
he never prophesieth good to me, but always evil: and it is Micheas
the son of Jemla. And Josaphat said: Speak not thus, O
king.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king of Israel called one of the eunuchs, and
said to him : Call quickly Micheas the son of Jemla.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the king of Israel, and Josaphat king of Juda, both
sat on their thrones, clothed in royal robes, and they sat in the
open court by the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets prophesied
before them.</span></li>
<li><span>And Sedecias the son of Chanaana made him horns of iron,
and said: Thus saith the Lord: With these shalt thou push Syria,
till thou destroy it.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the prophets prophesied in like manner, and said:
Go up to Ramoth Galaad, and thou shalt prosper, and the Lord will
deliver them into the king's hand.</span></li>
<li><span>And the messenger that went to call Micheas, said to him:
Behold the words of all the prophets with one mouth declare good to
the king: I beseech thee therefore let not thy word disagree with
them, and speak thou also good success.</span></li>
<li><span>And Micheas answered him: As the Lord liveth, whatsoever
my God shall say to me, that will I speak.</span></li>
<li><span>So he came to the king: and the king said to him:
Micheas, shall we go to Ramoth Galaad to fight, or forbear? And he
answered him: Go up, for all shall succeed prosperously, and the
enemies shall be delivered into your hands.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said: I adjure thee again and again to say
nothing but the truth to me, in the name of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Then he said: I saw all Israel scattered in the
mountains, like sheep without a shepherd : and the Lord said: These
have no masters: let every man return to his own house in
peace.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king of Israel said to Josaphat: Did I not tell
thee that this man would not prophesy me any good, but
evil?</span></li>
<li><span>Then he said: Hear ye therefore the word of the Lord: I
saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the army of heaven
standing by him on the right hand and on the left.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said: Who shall deceive Achab king of
Israel, that he may go up and fall in Ramoth Galaad? And when one
spoke in this manner, and another otherwise:</span></li>
<li><span>There came forth a spirit, and stood before the Lord, and
said: I will deceive him. And the Lord said to him: By what means
wilt thou deceive him?</span></li>
<li><span>And he answered: I will go out, and be a lying spirit in
the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said: Thou shalt
deceive, and shalt prevail: go out, and do so.</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore behold the Lord hath put a spirit of lying
in the mouth of all thy prophets, and the Lord hath spoken evil
against thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And Sedecias the son of Chanaana came, and struck Micheas
on the cheek and said: Which way went the spirit of the Lord from
me, to speak to thee?</span></li>
<li><span>And Micheas said :Thou thyself shalt see in that day,
when thou shalt go in from chamber to chamber, to hide
thyself.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king of Israel commanded, saying: Take Micheas,
and carry him to Amen the governor of the city, and to Joas the son
of Amelech,</span></li>
<li><span>And say: Thus saith the king: Put this fellow in prison,
and give him bread and water in a small quantity till I return in
peace.</span></li>
<li><span>And Micheas said: If thou return in peace, the Lord hath
not spoken by me. And he said: Hear, all ye people.</span></li>
<li><span>So the king of Israel and Josaphat king of Juda went up
to Ramoth Galaad.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king of Israel said to Josaphat: I will change my
dress, and so I will go to the battle, but put thou on thy own
garments. And the king of Israel having changed his dress, went to
the battle.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his
cavalry, saying: Fight ye not with small, or great, but with the
king of Israel only.</span></li>
<li><span>So when the captains of the cavalry saw Josaphat, they
said: This is the king of Israel. And they surrounded him to attack
him: but he cried to the Lord, and he helped him, and turned them
away from him.</span></li>
<li><span>For when the captains of the cavalry saw, that he was not
the king of Israel, they left him.</span></li>
<li><span>And it happened that one of the people shot an arrow at a
venture, and struck the king of Israel between the neck and the
shoulders, and he said to his chariot man: Turn thy hand, and carry
me out of the battle, for I am wounded.</span></li>
<li><span>And the fight was ended that day: but the king of Israel
stood in his chariot against the Syrians until the evening, and
died at the sunset.</span></li>

<li><span>And Josaphat king of Juda returned to his house in peace
to Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer met him, and said to
him: Thou helpest the ungodly, and thou art joined in friendship
with them that hate the Lord, and therefore thou didst deserve
indeed the wrath of the Lord:</span></li>
<li><span>But good works are found in thee, because thou hast taken
away the groves out of the land of Juda, and hast prepared thy
heart to seek the Lord the God of thy fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again to
the people from Bersabee to mount Ephraim, and brought them back to
the Lord the God of their fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>And he set judges of the land in all the fenced cities of
Juda, in every place.</span></li>
<li><span>And charging the judges, he said: Take heed what you do:
for you exercise not the judgment of man, but of the Lord: and
whatsoever you judge, it shall redound to you.</span></li>
<li><span>Let the fear of the Lord be with you, and do all things
with diligence: for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, a
nor respect of persons, nor desire of gifts.</span></li>
<li><span>In Jerusalem also Josaphat appointed Levites, and priests
and chiefs of the families of Israel, to judge the judgment and the
cause of the Lord for the inhabitants thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>And he charged them, saying: Thus shall you do in the
fear of the Lord faithfully, and with a perfect heart.</span></li>
<li><span>Every cause that shall come to you of your brethren, that
dwell in their cities, between kindred and kindred, wheresoever
there is question concerning the law, the commandment, the
ceremonies, the justifications: shew it them, that they may not sin
against the Lord, and that wrath may not come upon you and your
brethren: and so doing you shall not sin.</span></li>
<li><span>And Amarias the priest your high priest shell be chief in
the things which regard God: and Zabadias the son of Ismahel, who
is ruler in the house of Juda, shall be over those matters which
belong to the king's office : and you have before you the Levites
for masters, take courage and do diligently, and the Lord will be
with you in good things.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>After this the children of Moab, and the children of
Ammon, and with them of the Ammonites, were gathered together to
fight against Josaphat.</span></li>
<li><span>And there came messengers, and told Josaphat, saying:
There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea,
and out of Syria, and behold they are in Asasonthamar, which is
Engaddi.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josaphat being seized with fear betook himself wholly
to pray to the Lord, and he proclaimed a fast for all
Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>And Juda gathered themselves together to pray to the
Lord: and all came out of their cities to make supplication to
him.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josaphat stood in the midst of the assembly of Juda,
and Jerusalem, in the house of the Lord before the new
court,</span></li>
<li><span>And said: O Lord God of our fathers, thou art God in
heaven, and rulest over all the kingdoms and nations, in thy hand
is strength and power, and no one can resist thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Didst not thou our God kill all the inhabitants of this
land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham
thy friend for ever?</span></li>
<li><span>And they dwelt in it, and built in it a sanctuary to thy
name, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>If evils fall upon us, the sword of judgment, or
pestilence, or famine, we will stand in thy presence before this
house, in which thy name is called upon: and we will cry to thee in
our afflictions, and thou wilt hear, and save us.</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore behold the children of Ammon, and of Moab,
and mount Seir, through whose lands thou didst not allow Israel to
pass, when they came out of Egypt, but they turned aside from them,
and slew them not,</span></li>
<li><span>Do the contrary, and endeavour to cast us out of the
possession which thou hast delivered to us.</span></li>
<li><span>O our God, wilt thou not then judge them? as for us we
have not strength enough, to be able to resist this multitude,
which cometh violently upon us. But as we know not what to do, we
can only turn our eyes to thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And all Juda stood before the Lord with their little
ones, and their wives, and their children.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jahaziel the son of Zacharias, the son of Banaias,
the son of Jehiel, the son of Mathanias, a Levite of the sons of
Asaph, was there, upon whom the spirit of the Lord came in the
midst of the multitude,</span></li>
<li><span>And he said: Attend ye, all Juda, and you that dwell in
Jerusalem, and thou king Josaphat: Thus saith the Lord to you: Fear
ye not, and be not dismayed at this multitude: for the battle is
not yours, but God's.</span></li>
<li><span>To morrow you shall go down against them: for they will
come up by the ascent named Sis, and you shall find them at the
head of the torrent, which is over against the wilderness of
Jeruel.</span></li>
<li><span>It shall not be you that shall fight, but only stand with
confidence, and you shall see the help of the Lord over you, O
Juda, and Jerusalem: fear ye not, nor be you dismayed: to morrow
you shall go out against them, and the Lord will be with
you.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Josaphat, and Juda, and all the inhabitants of
Jerusalem fell hat on the ground before the Lord, and adored
him.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Levites of the sons of Caath, and of the sons of
Core praised the Lord the God of Israel with a loud voice, on
high.</span></li>
<li><span>And they rose early in the morning, and went out through
the desert of Thecua: and as they were marching, Josaphat standing
in the midst of them, said: Hear me, ye men of Juda, and all the
inhabitants of Jerusalem: believe in the Lord your God, and you
shall be secure: believe his prophets, and all things shall succeed
well.</span></li>
<li><span>And he gave counsel to the people, and appointed the
singing men of the Lord, to praise him by their companies, and to
go before the army, and with one voice to say: Give glory to the
Lord, for his mercy endureth for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they began to sing praises, the Lord turned
their ambushments upon themselves, that is to say, of the children
of Ammon, and of Moab, and of mount Seir, who were come out to
fight against Juda, and they were slain.</span></li>
<li><span>For the children of Ammon, and of Moab, rose up against
the inhabitants of mount Seir, to kill and destroy them: and when
they had made an end of them, they turned also against one another,
and destroyed one another.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Juda came to the watch tower, that looketh
toward the desert, they saw afar off all the country, for a great
space, full of dead bodies, and that no one was left that could
escape death.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Josaphat came, and all the people with him to take
away the spoils of the dead, and they found among the dead bodies,
stuff of various kinds, and garments, and most precious vessels:
and they took them for themselves, insomuch that they could not
carry all, nor in three days take away the spoils, the booty was so
great.</span></li>
<li><span>And on the fourth day they were assembled in the valley
of Blessing: for there they blessed the Lord, and therefore they
called that place the valley of Blessing until this
day.</span></li>
<li><span>And every man of Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
returned, and Josaphat at their head, into Jerusalem with great
joy, because the Lord had made them rejoice over their
enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>And they came into Jerusalem with psalteries, and harps,
and trumpets into the house of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And the fear of the Lord fell upon all the kingdoms of
the lands when they heard that the Lord had fought against the
enemies of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And the kingdom of Josaphat was quiet, and God gave him
peace round about.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josaphat reigned over Juda, and he was five and
thirty years old when he began to reign: and he reigned five and
twenty years in Jerusalem: and the name of his mother was Azuba the
daughter of Selahi.</span></li>
<li><span>And he walked in the way of his father Asa, and departed
not from it, doing the things that were pleasing before the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>But yet he took not away the high places, and the people
had not yet turned their heart to the Lord the God of their
fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>But the rest of the acts of Josaphat, first and last, are
written in the words of Jehu the son of Hanani, which he digested
into the books of the kings of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>After these things Josaphat king of Juda made friendship
with Ochozias king of Israel, whose works were very
wicked.</span></li>
<li><span>And he was partner with him in making ships, to go to
Tharsis: and they made the ships in Asiongaber.</span></li>
<li><span>And Eliezer the son of Dodau of Maresa prophesied to
Josaphat, saying: Because thou hast made a league with Ochozias,
the Lord hath destroyed thy works, and the ships are broken, and
they could not go to Tharsis.</span></li>

<li><span>And Josaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with
them in the city of David: and Joram his son reigned in his
stead.</span></li>
<li><span>And he had brethren the sons of Josaphat, Azarias, and
Jahiel, and Zacharias, and Azaria, and Michael, and Saphatias, all
these were the sons of Josaphat king of Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of
gold, and pensions, with strong cities in Juda: but the kingdom he
gave to Joram, because he was the eldest.</span></li>
<li><span>So Joram rose up over the kingdom of his father: and when
he had established himself, he slew all his brethren with the
sword, and some of the princes of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Joram was two and thirty years old when he began to
reign: and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, as the
house of Achab had done: for his wife was a daughter of Achab, and
he did evil in the sight of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>But the Lord would not destroy the house of David:
because of the covenant which he had made with him: and because he
had promised to give a lamp to him, and to his sons for
ever.</span></li>
<li><span>In those days Edom revolted, from being subject to Juda,
and made themselves a king.</span></li>
<li><span>And Joram went over with his princes, and all his cavalry
with him, and rose in the night, and defeated the Edomites who had
surrounded him, and all the captains of his cavalry.</span></li>
<li><span>However Edom revolted, from being under the dominion of
Juda unto this day: at that time Lobna also revolted, from being
under his hand. For he had forsaken the Lord the God of his
fathers:</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover he built also high places in the cities of Juda,
and he made the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and
Juda to transgress.</span></li>
<li><span>And there was a letter brought him from Elias the
prophet, in which it was written: Thus saith the Lord the God of
David thy father: Because thou hast not walked in the ways of
Josaphat thy father nor in the ways of Asa king of
Juda,</span></li>
<li><span>But hast walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and
hast made Juda and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit
fornication, imitating the fornication of the house of Achab,
moreover also thou hast killed thy brethren, the house of thy
father, better men than thyself,</span></li>
<li><span>Behold the Lord will strike thee with a great plague,
with all thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy
substance.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt be sick of a very grievous disease of thy
bowels, till thy vital parts come out by little and little every
day.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord stirred up against Joram the spirit of the
Philistines, and of the Arabians, who border on the
Ethiopians.</span></li>
<li><span>And they came up into the land of Juda, and wasted it,
and they carried away all the substance that was found in the
king's house, his sons also, and his wives: so that there was no
son left him but Joachaz, who was the youngest.</span></li>
<li><span>And besides all this the Lord struck him with an
incurable disease in his bowels.</span></li>
<li><span>And as day came after day, and time rolled on, two whole
years passed: then after being wasted with a long consumption, so
as to void his very bowels, his disease ended with his life. And he
died of a most wretched illness, and the people did not make a
funeral for him according to the manner of burning, as they had
done for his ancestors.</span></li>
<li><span>He was two and thirty years old when he began his reign,
and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. And he walked not rightly,
and they buried him in the city of David: but not in the sepulchres
of the kings.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ochozias his
youngest son king in his place: for the rovers of the Arabians, who
had broke in upon the camp, had killed all that were his elder
brothers. So Ochozias the son of Joram king of Juda
reigned.</span></li>
<li><span>Ochozias was forty-two years old when he began to reign,
and he reigned one year in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother
was Athalia the daughter of Amri.</span></li>
<li><span>He also walked in the ways of the house of Achab: for his
mother pushed him on to do wickedly.</span></li>
<li><span>So he did evil in the sight of the Lord, as the house of
Achab did: for they were his counsellors after the death of his
father, to his destruction.</span></li>
<li><span>And he walked after their counsels. And he went with
Joram the son of Achab king of Israel, to fight against Hazael king
of Syria, at Ramoth Galaad : and the Syrians wounded
Joram.</span></li>
<li><span>And he returned to be healed in Jezrahel: for he received
many wounds in the foresaid battle. And Ochozias the son of Joram
king of Juda, went down to visit Joram the son of Achab in Jezrahel
where he lay sick.</span></li>
<li><span>For it was the will of God against Ochozias that he
should come to Joram: and when he was come should go out also
against Jehu the son of Namsi, whom the Lord had anointed to
destroy the house of Achab.</span></li>
<li><span>So when Jehu was rooting out the house of Achab, he found
the princes of Juda, and the sons of the brethren of Ochozias, who
served him, and he slew them.</span></li>
<li><span>And he sought for Ochozias himself, and took him lying
hid in Samaria: and when he was brought to him, he killed him, and
they buried him: because he was the son of Josaphat, who had sought
the Lord with all his heart. And there was no more hope that any
one should reign of the race of Ochozias.</span></li>
<li><span>For Athalia his mother, seeing that her son was dead,
rose up, and killed all the royal family of the house of
Joram.</span></li>
<li><span>But Josabeth the king's daughter took Joas the son of
Ochozias, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain.
And she hid him with his nurse in a bedchamber: now Josabeth that
hid him, was daughter of king Joram, wife of Joiada the high
priest, and sister of Ochozias, and therefore Athalia did not kill
him.</span></li>
<li><span>And he was with them hid in the house of God six years,
during which Athalia reigned over the land.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="23">2 Paralipomenon 23</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And in the seventh year Joiada being encouraged, took the
captains of hundreds, to wit, Azarias the son of Jeroham, and
Ismahel the son of Johanan, and Azarias the son of Obed, and
Maasias the son of Adaias, and Elisaphat the son of Zechri: and
made a covenant with them.</span></li>
<li><span>And they went about Juda, and gathered together the
Levites out of all the cities of Juda, and the chiefs of the
families of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the multitude made a covenant with the king in
the house of God: and Joiada said to them: Behold the king's son
shall reign, as the Lord hath said of the sons of
David.</span></li>
<li><span>And this is the thing that you shall do:</span></li>
<li><span>A third part of you that come to the sabbath, of the
priests, and of the Levites, and of the porters, shall be at the
gates: and a third part at the king's house: and a third at the
gate that is called the Foundation: but let all the rest of the
people be in the courts of the house of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And let no one come into the house of the Lord, but the
priests, and they that minister of the Levites: let them only come
in, because they are sanctified : and let all the rest of the
people keep the watches of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And let the Levites be round about the king, every man
with his arms; (and if any other come into the temple, let him be
slain;) and let them be with the king, both coming in, and going
out.</span></li>
<li><span>So the Levites, and all Juda did according to all that
Joiada the high priest bad commanded: and they took every one his
men that were under him, and that came in by the course of the
sabbath, with those who had fulfilled the sabbath, and were to go
out. For Joiada the high priest permitted not the companies to
depart, which were accustomed to succeed one another every
week.</span></li>
<li><span>And Joiada the priest gave to the captains the spears,
and the shields, and targets of king David, which he had dedicated
in the house of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And he set all the people with swords in their hands from
the right side of the temple, to the left side of the temple,
before the altar, and the temple, round about the king.</span></li>
<li><span>And they brought out the king's son, and put the crown
upon him, and the testimony, and gave him the law to hold in his
hand, and they made him king: and Joiada the high priest and his
sons anointed him: and they prayed for him, and said: God save the
king.</span></li>
<li><span>Now when Athalia heard the noise of the people running
and praising the king, she came in to the people, into the temple
of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And when she saw the king standing upon the step in the
entrance, and the princes, and the companies about him, and all the
people of the land rejoicing, and sounding with trumpets, and
playing on instruments of divers kinds, and the voice of those that
praised, she rent her garments, and said: Treason,
treason.</span></li>
<li><span>And Joiada the high priest going out to the captains, and
the chiefs of the army, said to them: Take her forth without the
precinct of the temple, and when she is without let her be killed
with the sword. For the priest commanded that she should not be
killed in the house of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And they laid hold on her by the neck: and when she was
come within the horse gate of the palace, they killed her
there.</span></li>
<li><span>And Joiada made a covenant between himself and all the
people, and the king, that they should be the people of the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the people went into the house of Baal, and
destroyed it: and they broke down his altars and his idols: and
they slew Mathan the priest of Baal before the altars.</span></li>
<li><span>And Joiada appointed overseers in the house of the Lord,
under the hands of the priests, and the Levites, whom David had
distributed in the house of the Lord: to offer holocausts to the
Lord, as it is written in the law of Moses, with joy and singing,
according to the disposition of David.</span></li>
<li><span>He appointed also porters in the gates of the house of
the Lord, that none who was unclean in any thing should enter
in.</span></li>
<li><span>And he took the captains of hundreds, and the most
valiant men, and the chiefs of the people, and all the people of
the land, and they brought down the king from the house of the
Lord, and brought him through the upper gate into the king's house,
and set him on the royal throne.</span></li>
<li><span>21And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city
was quiet: but Athalia was slain with the sword.</span></li>

<li><span>Joas was seven years old when he began to reign: and he
reigned forty years in Jerusalem : the name of his mother was Sebia
of Bersabee.</span></li>
<li><span>And he did that which is good before the Lord all the
days of Joiada the priest.</span></li>
<li><span>And Joiada took for him two wives, by whom he had sons
and daughters.</span></li>
<li><span>After this Joas had a mind to repair the house of the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And he assembled the priests, and the Levites, and said
to them: Go out to the cities of Juda, and gather of all Israel
money to repair the temple of your God, from year to year: and do
this with speed: but the Levites were negligent.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king called Joiada the chief, and said to him:
Why hast thou not taken care to oblige the Levites to bring in out
of Juda and Jerusalem the money that was appointed by Moses the
servant of the Lord for all the multitude of Israel to bring into
the tabernacle of the testimony?</span></li>
<li><span>For that wicked woman Athalia, and her children have
destroyed the house of God, and adorned the temple of Baal with all
the things that had been dedicated in the temple of the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king commanded, and they made a chest: and set it
by the gate of the house of the Lord on the outside.</span></li>
<li><span>And they made a proclamation in Juda and Jerusalem, that
every man should bring to the Lord the money which Moses the
servant of God appointed for all Israel, in the desert.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the princes, and all the people rejoiced: and
going In they contributed and cast so much into the chest of the
Lord, that it was filled.</span></li>
<li><span>And when it was time to bring the chest before the king
by the hands of the Levites, (for they saw there was much money,)
the king's scribe, and he whom the high priest had appointed went
in: and they poured out the money that was in the chest: and they
carried back the chest to its place: and thus they did from day to
day, and there was gathered an immense sum of money.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king and Joiada gave it to those who were over
the works of the house of the Lord: but they hired with it
stonecutters, and artificers of every kind of work to repair the
house of the Lord: and such as wrought in iron and brass, to uphold
what began to be falling.</span></li>
<li><span>And the workmen were diligent, and the breach of the
walls was closed up by their hands, and they set up the house of
the Lord in its former state, and made it stand firm.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they had finished all the works, they brought
the rest of the money before the king and Joiada: and with it were
made vessels for the temple for the ministry, and for holocausts
and bowls, and other vessels of gold and silver : and holocausts
were offered in the house of the Lord continually all the days of
Joiada.</span></li>
<li><span>But Joiada grew old and was full of days, and died when
he was a hundred and thirty years old.</span></li>
<li><span>And they buried him in the city of David among the kings,
because he had done good to Israel, and to his house.</span></li>
<li><span>And after the death of Joiada, the princes of Juda went
in, and worshipped the king: and he was soothed by their services
and hearkened to them.</span></li>
<li><span>And they forsook the temple of the Lord the God of their
fathers, and served groves and idols, and wrath came upon Juda and
Jerusalem for this sin.</span></li>
<li><span>And he sent prophets to them to bring them back to the
Lord, and they would not give ear when they testified against
them.</span></li>
<li><span>The spirit of God then came upon Zacharias the son of
Joiada the priest, and he stood in the sight of the people, and
said to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Why transgress you the
commandment of the Lord which will not be for your good, and have
forsaken the Lord, to make him forsake you?</span></li>
<li><span>And they gathered themselves together against him, and
stoned him at the king's commandment in the court of the house of
the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And king Joas did not remember the kindness that Joiada
his father had done to him, but killed his son. And when he died,
he said: The Lord see, and require it.</span></li>
<li><span>And when a year was come about, the army of Syria came up
against him: and they came to Juda and Jerusalem, end killed all
the princes of the people, and they sent all the spoils to the king
of Damascus.</span></li>
<li><span>And whereas there came a very small number of the
Syrians, the Lord delivered into their hands an infinite multitude,
because they had forsaken the Lord the God of their fathers: and on
Joas they executed shameful judgments.</span></li>
<li><span>And departing they left him in diseases: and his servants
rose up him, for revenge of the blood of the son of Joiada the
priest, and they slew him in his bed, and he died: and they buried
him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the
kings.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the men that conspired against him were Zabad the son
of Semmaath an Ammonitess, and Jozabad the son of Semarith a
Moabitess.</span></li>
<li><span>And concerning his sons, and the sum of money which was
gathered under him, and the repairing the house of God; they are
written more diligently in the book of kings: and Amasias his son
reigned in his stead.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="25">2 Paralipomenon 25</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Amasias was five and twenty years old when he began to
reign, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem, the name
of his mother was Joadan of Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And he did what was good in the sight of the Lord: but
yet not with a perfect heart.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he saw himself strengthened in his kingdom, he
put to death the servants that had slain the king his
father.</span></li>
<li><span>But he slew not their children, as it is written in the
book of the law of Moses, where the Lord commanded, saying: The
fathers shall not be slain for the children, nor the children for
their fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.</span></li>
<li><span>Amasias therefore gathered Juda together, and appointed
them by families, and captains of thousands and of hundreds in all
Juda, and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and
upwards, and found three hundred thousand young men that could go
out to battle, and could hold the spear and shield.</span></li>
<li><span>He hired also of Israel a hundred thousand valiant men,
for a hundred talents of silver.</span></li>
<li><span>But a man of God came to him, and said: O king, let not
the army of Israel go out with thee, for the Lord is not with
Israel, and all the children of Ephraim:</span></li>
<li><span>And if thou think that battles consist in the strength of
the army, God will make thee to be overcome by the enemies: for it
belongeth to God both to help, and to put to flight.</span></li>
<li><span>And Amasias said to the man of God: What will then become
of the hundred talents which I have given to the soldiers of
Israeli and the man of God answered him: The Lord is rich enough to
be able to give thee much more than this.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Amasias separated the army, that came to him out of
Ephraim, to go home again: but they being much enraged against
Juda, returned to their own country.</span></li>
<li><span>And Amasias taking courage led forth his people, and went
to the vale of saltpits, and slew of the children of Seir ten
thousand.</span></li>
<li><span>And other ten thousand men the sons of Juda took, and
brought to the steep of a certain rock, and cast them down headlong
from the top, and they all were broken to pieces.</span></li>
<li><span>But that army which Amasias had sent back, that they
should not go with him to battle, spread themselves among the
cities of Juda, from Samaria to Beth-horon, and having killed three
thousand took away much spoil.</span></li>
<li><span>But Amasias after he had slain the Edomites, set up the
gods of the children of Seir, which he had brought thence, to be
his gods, and adored them, and burnt incense to them.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore the Lord being angry against Amasias, sent a
prophet to him, to say to him: Why hast thou adored gods that have
not delivered their own people out of thy hand?</span></li>
<li><span>And when he spoke these things, he answered him: Art thou
the king's counsellor? be quiet, lest I kill thee. And the prophet
departing, said: I know that God is minded to kill thee, because
thou hast done this evil, and moreover hast not hearkened to my
counsel.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Amasias king of Juda taking very bad counsel, sent
to Joas the son of Joachaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying:
Come, let us see one another.</span></li>
<li><span>But he sent back the messengers, saying: The thistle that
is in Libanus, sent to the cedar in Libanus, saying: Give thy
daughter to my son to wife: and behold the beasts that were in the
wood of Libanus passed by, and trod down the thistle.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast said: I have overthrown Edom, and therefore thy
heart is lifted up with pride : stay at home, why dost thou provoke
evil against thee, that both thou shouldst fall and Juda with
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Amasias would not hearken to him, because it was the
Lord's will that he should be delivered into the hands of enemies,
because of the gods of Edom.</span></li>
<li><span>So Joas king of Israel went up, and they presented
themselves to be seen by one another: and Amasias king of Juda was
in Bethsames of Juda:</span></li>
<li><span>And Juda fell before Israel and they fled to their
dwellings.</span></li>
<li><span>And Joas king of Israel took Amasias king of Juda, the
son of Joas, the son Joachaz, in Bethsames, and brought him to
Jerusalem: and broke down the walls thereof from the gate of
Ephraim, to the gate of the corner, four hundred
cubits.</span></li>
<li><span>And he took all the gold, and silver, and all the
vessels, that he found in the house of God, and with Obededom, and
in the treasures of the king's house, moreover also the sons of the
hostages, he brought back to Samaria.</span></li>
<li><span>And Amasias the son of Joas king of Juda lived, after the
death of Joas the son of Joachaz king of Israel, fifteen
years.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the rest of the acts of Amasias, the first and last,
are written in the book of the kings of Juda and
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And after he revolted from the Lord, they made a
conspiracy against him in Jerusalem. And he fled into Lachis, and
they sent, and killed him there.</span></li>
<li><span>And they brought him back upon horses, and buried him
with his fathers in the city of David.</span></li>

<li><span>And all the people of Juda took his son Ozias, who was
sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of Amasias his
father.</span></li>
<li><span>He built Ailath, and restored it to the dominion of Juda,
after that the king slept with his fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>Ozias was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and
he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother
was Jechelia of Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord,
according to all that Amasias his father had done.</span></li>
<li><span>And he sought the Lord in the days of Zacharias that
understood and saw God: and as long as he sought the Lord, he
directed him in all things.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover he went forth and fought against the
Philistines, and broke down the wall of Geth, and the wall of
Jabnia, and the wall of Azotus: and he built towns in Azotus, and
among the Philistines.</span></li>
<li><span>And God helped him against the Philistines, and against
the Arabians, that dwelt in Gurbaal, and against the
Ammonites.</span></li>
<li><span>And the ammonites gave gifts to Ozias: and his name was
spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt for his frequent
victories.</span></li>
<li><span>And Ozias built towers in Jerusalem over the gate of the
corner, and over the gate of the valley, and the rest, in the same
side of the wall, and fortified them.</span></li>
<li><span>And he built towers in the wilderness, and dug many
cisterns, for he had much cattle both in the plains, and in the
waste of the desert: he had also vineyards and dressers of vines in
the mountains, and in Carmel: for he was a man that loved
husbandry.</span></li>
<li><span>And the army of his fighting men, that went out to war,
was under the hand of Jehiel the scribe, and Maasias the doctor,
end under the hand of Henanias, who was one of the king's
captains.</span></li>
<li><span>And the whole number of the chiefs by the families of
valiant men were two thousand six hundred.</span></li>
<li><span>And the whole army under them three hundred and seven
thousand five hundred: who were fit for war, and fought for the
king against the enemy.</span></li>
<li><span>And Ozias prepared for them, that is, for the whole army,
shields, and spears, and helmets, and coats of mail, and bows, and
slings to cast stones.</span></li>
<li><span>And he made in Jerusalem engines of diverse kinds, which
he placed in the towers, and in the corners of the walls, to shoot
arrows, and great stones: and his name went forth far abroad, for
the Lord helped him, and had strengthened him.</span></li>
<li><span>But when he was made strong, his heart was lifted up to
his destruction, and he neglected the Lord his God: and going into
the temple of the Lord, he had a mind to burn incense upon the
altar of incense.</span></li>
<li><span>And immediately Azarias the priest going in after him,
and with him fourscore priests of the Lord, most valiant
men,</span></li>
<li><span>Withstood the king and said: It doth not belong to thee,
Ozias, to burn incense to the Lord, but to the priests, that is, to
the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated for this ministry: go out of
the sanctuary, do not despise: for this thing shall not be
accounted to thy glory by the Lord God.</span></li>
<li><span>And Ozias was angry, and holding in his hand the censer
to burn incense, threatened the priests. And presently there rose a
leprosy in his forehead before the priests, in the house of the
Lord at the altar of incense.</span></li>
<li><span>And Azarias the high priest, and all the rest of the
priests looked upon him, and saw the leprosy in his forehead, and
they made haste to thrust him out. Yea himself also being
frightened, hasted to go out, because he had quickly felt the
stroke of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And Ozias the king was a leper unto the day of his death,
and he dwelt in a house apart being full of the leprosy, for which
he had been cast out of the house of the Lord. And Joatham his son
governed the king's house, and judged the people of the
land.</span></li>
<li><span>But the rest of the acts of Ozias first and last were
written by Isaias the son of Amos, the prophet.</span></li>
<li><span>And Ozias slept with his fathers, and they buried him in
the field of the royal sepulchres, because he was a leper: and
Joatham his son reigned in his stead.</span></li>

<li><span>Joatham was five and twenty years old when he began to
reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: the name of his
mother was Jerusa the daughter of Sadoc.</span></li>
<li><span>And he did that which was right before the Lord,
according to all that Ozias his father had done, only that he
entered not into the temple of the Lord, and the people still
transgressed.</span></li>
<li><span>He built the high gate of the house of the Lord, and on
the wall of Ophel he built much.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Juda, and
castles and towers in the forests.</span></li>
<li><span>Ho fought against the king of the children of Ammon, and
overcame them, and the children of Ammon gave him at that time a
hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and
as many measures of barley: so much did the children of Ammon give
him in the second and third year.</span></li>
<li><span>And Joatham was strengthened, be- cause he had his way
directed before the Lord his God.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the rest of the acts of Joatham, and all his wars,
and his works, are written in the book of the kings of Israel and
Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign,

<li><span>But walked in the ways of the kings of Israel; moreover
also he cast statues for Baalim.</span></li>
<li><span>It was he that burnt incense in the valley of Benennom,
and consecrated his sons in the fire according to the manner of the
nations, which the Lord slew at the coming of the children of
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>He sacrificed also, and burnt incense in the high places,
and on the hills, and under every green tree.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord his God delivered him into the hands of the
king of Syria, who defeated him, and took a great booty out of his
kingdom, and carried it to Damascus: he was also delivered into the
hands of the king of Israel, who overthrew him with a great
slaughter.</span></li>
<li><span>For Phacee the son of Romelia slew of Juda a hundred and
twenty thousand in one day, all valiant men: because they had
forsaken the Lord the God of their fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>At the same time Zechri a powerful man of Ephraim, slew
Maasias the king's son, and Ezricam the governor of his house, and
Elcana who was next to the king.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Israel carried away of their brethren
two hundred thousand women, boys, and girls, and an immense booty:
and they brought it to Samaria.</span></li>
<li><span>At that time there was a prophet of the Lord there, whose
name was Oded: and he went out to meet the army that came to
Samaria, and said to them: Be- hold the Lord the God of your
fathers being angry with Juda, hath delivered them into your hands,
and you have butchered them cruelly, so that your cruelty hath
reached up to heaven.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover you have a mind to keep under the children of
Juda and Jerusalem for your bondmen and bondwomen, which ought not
to be done : for you have sinned in this against the Lord your
God.</span></li>
<li><span>But hear ye my counsel, and release the captives that you
have brought of your brethren, because a great indignation of the
Lord hangeth over you.</span></li>
<li><span>Then some of the chief men of the sons of Ephraim,
Azarias the son of Johanan, Barachias the son of Mosollamoth,
Ezechias the son of Sellum, and Amasa the son of Adali, stood up
against them that came from the war.</span></li>
<li><span>And they said to them: You shall not bring in the
captives hither, lest we sin against the Lord. Why will you add to
our sins, and heap up upon our former offences? for the sin is
great, and the fierce anger of the Lord hangeth over
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>So the soldiers left the spoils, and all that they had
taken, before the princes and all the multitude.</span></li>
<li><span>And the men, whom we mentioned above, rose up and took
the captives, and with the spoils clothed all them that were naked:
and when they had clothed and shed them, and refreshed them with
meat and drink, and anointed them because of their labour, and had
taken care of them, they set such of them as could not walk, and
were feeble, upon beasts, and brought them to Jericho the city of
palm trees to their brethren, and they returned to
Samaria.</span></li>
<li><span>At that time king Achaz sent to the king of the Assyrians
asking help.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Edomites came and slew many of Juda, and took a
great booty.</span></li>
<li><span>The Philistines also spread themselves among the cities
of the plains, and to the south of Juda: and they took Bethsames,
and Aialon, and Gaderoth, and Socho, and Thamnan, and Gamzo, with
their villages, and they dwelt in them.</span></li>
<li><span>For the Lord had humbled Juda because of Achaz the king
of Juda, for he had stripped it of help, and had contemned the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And he brought, against him Thelgathphalnasar king of the
Assyrians, who also afflicted him, and plundered him without any
resistance.</span></li>
<li><span>And Achaz stripped the house of the Lord, and the house
of the kings, and of the princes, and gave gifts to the king of the
Assyrians, and yet it availed him nothing.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover also in the time of his distress he increased
contempt against the Lord: king Achaz himself by
himself,</span></li>
<li><span>Sacrificed victims to the gods of Damascus that struck
him, and he said: The gods of the kings of Syria help them, and I
will appease them with victims, and they will help me; whereas on
the contrary they were the ruin of him, and of all
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Achaz having taken away all the vessels of the house
of God, and broken them, shut up the doors of the temple of God,
and made himself altars in all the corners of
Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And in all the cities of Juda he built altars to burn
frankincense, and he provoked the Lord the God of his fathers to
wrath.</span></li>
<li><span>But the rest of his acts, and all his works first and
last are written in the book of the kings of Juda and
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And Achaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in
the city of Jerusalem: for they received him not into the
sepulchres of the kings of Israel. And Ezechias his son reigned in
his stead.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="29">2 Paralipomenon 29</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Now Ezechias began to reign, when he was five and twenty
years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem: the
name of his mother was Abia, the daughter of Zacharias.</span></li>
<li><span>And he did that which was pleasing in the sight of the
Lord, according to all that David his father had done.</span></li>
<li><span>In the first year and month of his reign he opened the
doors of the house of the Lord, and repaired them.</span></li>
<li><span>And he brought the priests and the Levites, and assembled
them in the east street.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to them: Hear me, ye Levites, and be
sanctified, purify the house of the Lord the God of your fathers,
and take away all filth out of the sanctuary.</span></li>
<li><span>Our fathers have sinned and done evil in the sight of the
Lord God, forsaking him: they have turned away their faces from the
tabernacle of the Lord, and turned their backs.</span></li>
<li><span>They have shut up the doors that were in tile porch, and
put out the lamps. and have not burnt incense, nor offered
holocausts in the sanctuary of the God of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore the wrath of the Lord hath been stirred up
against Juda and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to trouble,
and to destruction, and to be hissed at, as you see with your
eyes.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold, our fathers are fallen by the sword, our sons,
and our daughters, and wives are led away captives for this
wickedness.</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore I have a mind that we make a covenant with
the Lord the God of Israel, and he will turn away the wrath of his
indignation from us.</span></li>
<li><span>My sons, be not negligent: the Lord hath chosen you to
stand before him, and to minister to him, and to worship him, and
to burn incense to him.</span></li>
<li><span>Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and
Joel the son of Azarias, of the sons of Caath: and of the sons of
Merari, Cis the son of Abdi, and Azarias the son of Jalaleel. And
of the sons of Gerson, Joah the son of Zemma, and Eden the son of
Joah.</span></li>
<li><span>And of the sons of Elisaphan, Samri, and Jahiel. Also of
the sons of Asaph, Zacharias, and Mathanias.</span></li>
<li><span>And of the sons of Heman, Jahiel, and Semei: and of the
sons of Idithun, Semeias, and Oziel.</span></li>
<li><span>And they gathered together their brethren, and sanctified
themselves, and went in according to the commandment of the king,
and the precept of the Lord, to purify the house of
God.</span></li>
<li><span>And the priests went into the temple of the Lord to
sanctify it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found
within to the entrance of the house of the Lord, and the Levites
took it away, and carried it out abroad to the torrent
Cedron.</span></li>
<li><span>And they began to cleanse on the first day of the first
month, and on the eighth day of the same month they came into the
porch of the temple of the Lord, and they purified the temple in
eight days, and on the sixteenth day of the same month they
finished what they had begun.</span></li>
<li><span>And they went is to king Ezechias, and said to him: We
have sanctified all the house of the Lord, and the altar of
holocaust, and the vessels thereof, and the table of proposition
with all its vessels,</span></li>
<li><span>And all the furniture of the temple, which king Achaz in
his reign had defiled, after his transgression; and behold they are
all set forth before the altar of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And king Ezechias rising early, assembled all the rulers
of the city, and went up into the house of the Lord:</span></li>
<li><span>And they offered together seven bullocks, and seven rams,
and seven lambs, and seven he goats for sin, for the kingdom, for
the sanctuary, for Juda: and he spoke to the priests the sons of
Aaron, to offer them upon the altar of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore they killed the bullocks, and the priests took
the blood, and poured it upon the altar; they killed also the rams,
and their blood they poured also upon the altar, and they killed
the lambs, and poured the blood upon the altar.</span></li>
<li><span>And they brought the he goats for sin before the king,
and the whole multitude, and they laid their hand upon
them:</span></li>
<li><span>And the priests immolated them, and sprinkled their blood
before the altar for an expiation of all Israel: for the king had
commanded that the holocaust and the sin offering should be made
for all Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And he set the Levites in the house of the Lord with
cymbals, and psalteries, and harps according to the regulation of
David the king, and of Gad the seer, and of Nathan the prophet: for
it was the commandment of the Lord by the hand of his
prophets.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Levites stood, with the instruments of David, and
the priests with trumpets.</span></li>
<li><span>And Ezechias commanded that they should offer holocausts
upon the altar: and when the holocausts were offered, they began to
sing praises to the Lord, and to sound with trumpets, and divers
instruments which David the king of Israel had
prepared.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the multitude adored, and the singers, and the
trumpeters, were in their office till the holocaust was
finished.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the oblation was ended, the king, and all that
were with him bowed down and adored.</span></li>
<li><span>And Ezechias and the princes commanded the Levites to
praise the Lord with the words of David, and Asaph the seer: and
they praised him with great joy, and bowing the knee
adored.</span></li>
<li><span>And Ezechias added, and said: You have filled your hands
to the Lord, come and offer victims, and praises in the house of
the Lord. And all the multitude offered victims, and praises, and
holocausts with a devout mind.</span></li>
<li><span>And the number of the holocausts which the multitude
offered, was seventy bullocks, a hundred rams, and two hundred
lambs.</span></li>
<li><span>And they consecrated to the Lord six hundred oxen, and
three thousand sheep.</span></li>
<li><span>But the priests were few, and were not enough to flay the
holocausts: wherefore the Levites their brethren helped them, till
the work was ended, and priests were sanctified, for the Levites
are sanctified with an easier rite than the priests.</span></li>
<li><span>So there were many holocausts, and the fat of peace
offerings, and the libations of holocausts: and the service of the
house of the Lord was completed.</span></li>
<li><span>And Ezechias, and all the people rejoiced because the
ministry of the Lord was accomplished. For the resolution of doing
this thing was taken suddenly.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="30">2 Paralipomenon 30</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And Ezechias sent to all Israel and Juda: and he wrote
letters to Ephraim and Manasses, that they should come to the house
of the Lord in Jerusalem, and keep the phase to the Lord the God of
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>1, whilst they laughed at them and mocked
them.</span></li>
<li><span>For the king, taking counsel, and the princes, and all
the assembly of Jerusalem, decreed to keep the phase the second
month.</span></li>
<li><span>For they could not keep it in its time; because there
were not priests enough sanctified, and the people was not as yet
gathered together to Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And the thing pleased the king, and all the
people.</span></li>
<li><span>And they decreed to send messengers to all Israel from
Bersabee even to Dan, that they should come, and keep the phase to
the Lord the God of Israel in Jerusalem: for many had not kept it
as it is prescribed by the law.</span></li>
<li><span>And the posts went with letters by commandment of the
king, and his princes, to all Israel and Juda, proclaiming
according to the king's orders: Ye children of Israel, turn again
to the Lord the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Israel: and he
will return to the remnant of you that have escaped the hand of the
king of the Assyrians.</span></li>
<li><span>Be not like your fathers, and brethren, who departed from
the Lord the God of their fathers, and he hath given them up to
destruction, as you see.</span></li>
<li><span>Harden not your necks, as your fathers did: yield
yourselves to the Lord, and come to his sanctuary, which he hath
sanctified for ever: serve the Lord the God of your fathers, and
the wrath of his indignation shall be turned away from
you.</span></li>
<li><span>For if you turn again to the Lord: your brethren, and
children shall find mercy before their masters, that have led them
away captive, and they shall return into this land: for the Lord
your God is merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if
you return to him.</span></li>
<li><span>So the posts went speedily from city to city, through the
land of Ephraim, and of Manasses, even to ZabuloI</span></li>
<li><span>Nevertheless some men of Aser, and of Manasses, and of
Zabulon, yielding to the counsel, came to Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>But the hand of God was in Juda, to give them one heart
to do the word of the Lord, according to the commandment of the
king, and of the princes.</span></li>
<li><span>And much people were assembled to Jerusalem to celebrate
the solemnity of the unleavened bread in the second
month:</span></li>
<li><span>And they arose and destroyed the altars that were in
Jerusalem, and took sway all things in which incense was burnt to
idols, and cast them into the torrent Cedron.</span></li>
<li><span>And they immolated the phase on the fourteenth day of the
second month. And the priests and the Levites being at length
sanctified offered holocausts in the house of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And they stood in their order according to the
disposition, and law of Moses the man of God: but the priests
received the blood which was to be poured out, from the hands of
the Levites,</span></li>
<li><span>Because a great number was not sanctified: and therefore
the Levites immolated the phase for them that came not in time to
be sanctified to the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>For a great part of the people from Ephraim, and
Manasses, and Issachar, and Zabulon, that had not been sanctified,
ate the phase otherwise than it is written: and Ezechias prayed for
them, saying: The Lord who is good will shew mercy,</span></li>
<li><span>To all them, who with their whole heart, seek the Lord
the God of their fathers: and will not impute it to them that they
are not sanctified.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord heard him, and was merciful to the
people.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Israel, that were found at Jerusalem,
kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great joy,
praising the Lord every day: the Levites also, and the priests,
with instruments that agreed to their office.</span></li>
<li><span>And Ezechias spoke to the heart of all the Levites, that
had good understanding concerning the Lord: and they ate during the
seven days of the solemnity, immolating victims of peace offerings,
and praising the Lord the God of their fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>And it pleased the whole multitude to keep other seven
days: which they did with great joy.</span></li>
<li><span>For Ezechias the king of Juda had given to the multitude
a thousand bullocks, and seven thousand sheep: and the princes had
given the people a thousand bullocks, and ten thousand sheep: and a
great number of priests was sanctified.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the multitude of Juda with the priests and
Levites, and all the assembly, that came out of Israel; and the
proselytes of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Juda were full
of joy.</span></li>
<li><span>And there was a great solemnity in Jerusalem, such as had
not been in that city since the time of Solomon the son of David
king of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And the priests and the Levites rose up and blessed the
people: and their voice was heard: and their prayer came to the
holy dwelling place of heaven.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="31">2 Paralipomenon 31</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And when these things had been duly celebrated, all
Israel that were found in the cities of Juda, went out, and they
broke the idols, and cut down the groves. demolished the high
places, and destroyed the altars, not only out of all Juda and
Benjamin, but out of Ephraim also and Manasses, till they had
utterly destroyed them: then all the children of Israel returned to
their possessions and cities.</span></li>
<li><span>And Ezechias appointed companies of the priests, and the
Levites, by their courses, every man in his own office, to wit,
both of the priests, and of the Levites, for holocausts, and for
peace offerings, to minister, and to praise, and to sing in the
gates of the camp of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king's part was, that of his proper substance the
holocaust should be offered always morning and evening, and on the
sabbaths, and the new moons and the other solemnities, as it is
written in the law of Moses.</span></li>
<li><span>He commanded also the people that dwelt in Jerusalem, to
give to the priests, and the Levites their portion, that they might
attend to the law of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Which when it was noised abroad in the ears of the
people, the children of Israel offered in abundance the firstfruits
of corn, wine, and oil, and honey: and brought the tithe of all
things which the ground bringeth forth.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover the children of Israel and Juda, that dwelt in
the cities of Juda, brought in the tithes of oxen, and sheep, and
the tithes of holy things, which they had vowed to the Lord their
God: and carrying them all, made many heaps.</span></li>
<li><span>In the third month they began to lay the foundations of
the heaps, and in the seventh month, they finished
them.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Ezechias and his princes came in, they saw the
heaps, and they blessed the Lord and the people of
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And Ezechias asked the priests and the Levites, why the
heaps lay so.</span></li>
<li><span>Azarias the chief priest of the race of Sadoc answered
him, saying: Since the firstfruits began to be offered in the house
of the Lord, we have eaten, and have been filled, and abundance is
left, because the Lord hath blessed his people: and of that which
is left is this great store which thou seest.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Ezechias commanded to prepare storehouses in the
house of the Lord. And when they had done so,</span></li>
<li><span>They brought in faithfully both the firstfruits, and the
tithes, and all they had vowed. And the overseer of them was
Chonenias the Levite, and Semei his brother was the
second,</span></li>
<li><span>And after him Jehiel, and Azarias, and Nahath, and Asael,
and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Jesmachias, and Mahath,
and Banaias, overseers under the hand of Chonenias, and Semei his
brother, by the commandment of Ezechias the king, and Azarias the
high priest of the house of God, to whom all things
appertained.</span></li>
<li><span>But Core the son of Jemna the Levite, the porter of the
east gate, was overseer of the things which were freely offered to
the Lord, and of the firstfruits and the things dedicated for the
holy of holies.</span></li>
<li><span>And under his charge were Eden, and Benjamin, Jesue, and
Semeias, and Amarias, and Sechenias, in the cities of the priests,
to distribute faithfully portions to their brethren, both little
and great:</span></li>
<li><span>Besides the males from three years old and upward, to all
that went into the temple of the Lord, and whatsoever there was
need of in the ministry, and their offices according to their
courses, day by day.</span></li>
<li><span>To the priests by their families, and to the Levites from
the twentieth year and upward, by their classes and
companies.</span></li>
<li><span>And to all the multitude, both to their wives, and to
their children of both sexes, victuals were given faithfully out of
the things that had been sanctified.</span></li>
<li><span>Also of the sons of Aaron who were in the fields and in
the suburbs of each city, there were men appointed, to distribute
portions to all the males, among the priests and the
Levites.</span></li>
<li><span>So Ezechias did all things, which we have said in all
Juda, and wrought that which was good; and right, and truth, before
the Lord his God,</span></li>
<li><span>In all the service of the ministry of the house of the
Lord according to the law and the ceremonies, desiring to seek his
God with all his heart, and he did it and prospered,</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="32">2 Paralipomenon 32</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>After these things, and this truth, Sennacherib king of
the Assyrians came and entered into Juda, and besieged the fenced
cities, desiring to take them.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Ezechias saw that Sennacherib was come, and that
the whole force of the war was turning against
Jerusalem,</span></li>
<li><span>He took counsel with the princes, and the most valiant
men, to stop up the heads of the springs, that were without the
city: and as they were all of this mind,</span></li>
<li><span>He gathered together a very great multitude, and they
stopped up all the springs, and the brook, that ran through the
midst of the land, saying: Lest the kings of the Assyrians should
come, and And abundance of water.</span></li>
<li><span>He built up also with great diligence all the wall that
had been broken down, and built towers upon it, and another wall
without: and he repaired Mello in the city of David, and made all
sorts of arms and shields:</span></li>
<li><span>And he appointed captains of the soldiers of the army:
and he called them all together in the street of the gate of the
city, and spoke to their heart, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Behave like men, and take courage: be not afraid nor
dismayed for the king of the Assyrians, nor for all the multitude
that is with him: for there are many more with us than with
him.</span></li>
<li><span>For with him is an arm of flesh: with us the Lord our
God, who is our helper, and fighteth for us. And the people were
encouraged with these words of Ezechias king of Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>After this, Sennacherib king of the Assyrians sent his
servants to Jerusalem, (for he with all his army was besieging
Lachis,) to Ezechias king of Juda, and to all the people that were
in the city, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith Sennacherib king of the Assyrians: In whom do
you trust, that you sit still besieged in Jerusalem?</span></li>
<li><span>Doth not Ezechias deceive you, to give you up to die by
hunger and thirst, affirming that the Lord your God shall deliver
you from the hand of the king of the Assyrians?</span></li>
<li><span>Is it not this same Ezechias, that hath destroyed his
high places, and his altars, and commanded Juda and Jerusalem,
saying: You shall worship before one altar, and upon it you shall
burn incense?</span></li>
<li><span>Know you not what I and my fathers have done to all the
people of the lands? have the gods of any nations and lands been
able to deliver their country out of my hand?</span></li>
<li><span>Who is there among all the gods of the nations, which my
fathers have destroyed, that could deliver his people out of my
hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of this
hand?</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore let not Ezechias deceive you, nor delude you
with a vain persuasion, and do not believe him. For if no god of
all the nations and kingdoms, could deliver his people out of my
hand, and out of the hand of my fathers, consequently neither shall
your God be able to deliver you out of my hand.</span></li>
<li><span>And many other things did his servants speak against the
Lord God, and against Ezechias his servant.</span></li>
<li><span>He wrote also letters full of blasphemy against the Lord
the God of Israel, and he spoke against him: As the gods of other
nations could not deliver their people out of my hand, so neither
can the God of Ezechias deliver his people out of this
hand.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover he cried out with a loud voice, in the Jews'
tongue, to the people that sat on the walls of Jerusalem, that he
might frighten them, and take the city.</span></li>
<li><span>And he spoke against the God of Jerusalem, as against the
gods of the people of the earth, the works of the hands of
men.</span></li>
<li><span>And Ezechias the king, and Isaias the prophet the son of
Amos, prayed against this blasphemy, and cried out to
heaven.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord sent an angel who cut off all the stout men
and the warriors, and the captains of the army of the king of the
Assyrians: and he returned with disgrace into his own country. And
when he was come into the house of his god, his sons that came out
of his bowels, slew him with the sword.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord saved Ezechias and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, out of the hand of Sennacherib king of the Assyrians,
and out of the hand of all, and gave them treasures on every
side.</span></li>
<li><span>Many also brought victims, and sacrifices to the Lord to
Jerusalem, and presents to Ezechias king of Juda: and he was
magnified thenceforth in the sight of all nations.</span></li>
<li><span>In those days Ezechias was sick even to death, and he
prayed to the Lord: and he heard him, and gave him a
sign.</span></li>
<li><span>But he did not render again according to the benefits
which he had received, for his heart was lifted up: and wrath was
enkindled against him, and against Juda and Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And he humbled himself afterwards, because his heart had
been lifted up, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and
therefore the wrath of the Lord came not upon them in the days of
Ezechias.</span></li>
<li><span>And Ezechias was rich, and very glorious, and he gathered
himself great treasures of silver and of gold, and of precious
stones, of spices, and of arms, of all kinds, and of vessels of
great price.</span></li>
<li><span>Storehouses also of corn, of wine, and of oil, and stalls
for all beasts, and folds for cattle.</span></li>
<li><span>And he built himself cities: for he had docks of sheep,
and herds without number, for the Lord had given him very much
substance.</span></li>
<li><span>This same Ezechias was, he that stopped the upper source
of the waters of Gihon, and turned them away underneath toward the
west of the city of David : in ail his works he did prosperously
what he would.</span></li>
<li><span>But yet in the embassy of the princes of Babylon, that
were sent to him, to inquire of the wonder that had happened upon
the earth, God left him that he might be tempted, and all things
might be made known that were in his heart.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the rest of the acts of Ezechias, and of his mercies
are written in the book of the kings of Juda and
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And Ezechias slept with his fathers, m and they buried
him above the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Juda, and
all the inhabitants of Jerusalem celebrated his funeral: and
Manasses his son reigned in his stead.</span></li>
</ol>

<li><span>Manasses was twelve years old when he began to reign, and
he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And he did evil before the Lord, according to all the
abominations of the nations, which the Lord cast out before the
children of Israel:</span></li>
<li><span>And he turned, and built again the high places which
Ezechias his father had destroyed: and he built altars to Baalim,
and made groves, and he adored all the host of heaven, and
worshipped them.</span></li>
<li><span>He built also altars in the house of the Lord, whereof
the Lord had said: In Jerusalem shall my name be for
ever.</span></li>
<li><span>And he built them for all the host of heaven in the two
courts of the house of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And he made his sons to pass through the fire in the
valley of Benennom: he observed dreams, followed divinations, gave
himself up to magic arts, had with him magicians, and enchanters:
and he wrought many evils before the Lord, to provoke him to
anger.</span></li>
<li><span>He set also a graven, and a molten statue in the house of
God, of which God had said to David, and to Solomon his son: In
this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the
tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will not make the foot of Israel to be removed out
of the land which I have delivered to their fathers: yet so if they
will take heed to do what I hare commanded them, and all the law,
and the ceremonies, and judgments by the hand of Moses.</span></li>
<li><span>So Manasses seduced Juda, and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, to do evil beyond all the nations, which the Lord had
destroyed before the face of the children of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to him, and to his people, and they
would not hearken.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore he brought upon them the captains of the army
of the king of the Assyrians: and they took Manasses, and carried
him bound with chains and fetters to Babylon.</span></li>
<li><span>And after that he was in distress he prayed to the Lord
his God: and did penance exceedingly before the God of his
fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>And he entreated him, and besought him earnestly: and he
heard his prayer, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his
kingdom, and Manasses knew that the Lord was God.</span></li>
<li><span>After this he built a wall without the city of David, on
the west side of Gihon in the valley, from the entering in of the
fish gate round about to Ophel, and raised it up to a great height:
and he appointed captains of the army in all the fenced cities of
Juda:</span></li>
<li><span>And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of
the house of the Lord: the altars also which he had made in the
mount of the house of the Lord, and in Jerusalem, and he cast them
all out of the city.</span></li>
<li><span>And he repaired the altar of the Lord, and sacrificed
upon it victims, and peace offerings, and praise: and he commanded
Juda to serve the Lord the God of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Nevertheless the people still sacrificed in the high
places to the Lord their God.</span></li>
<li><span>But the rest of the acts of Manasses, and his prayer to
his God, and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name
of the Lord the God of Israel, are contained in the words of the
kings of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>His prayer also, and his being heard, and all his sins,
and contempt, and places wherein he built high places, and set up
groves, and statues before he did penance, are written in the words
of Hozai.</span></li>
<li><span>And Manasses slept with his fathers. and they buried him
in his house: and his son Amen reigned in his stead.</span></li>
<li><span>Amen was two and twenty years old when he began to reign,
and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And he did evil in the sight of the Lord, as Manasses his
father had done: and he sacrificed to all the idols which Manasses
his father had made, and served them.</span></li>
<li><span>And he did not humble himself before the Lord, as
Manasses his father had humbled himself, but committed far greater
sins.</span></li>
<li><span>And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in
his own house.</span></li>
<li><span>But the rest of the multitude of the people slew them
that had killed Amen, and made Josias his son king in his
stead.</span></li>

<li><span>Josias was eight years old when he began to reign, and he
reigned one and thirty years in Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord,
and walked in the ways of David his father: he declined not,
neither to the right hand, nor to the left.</span></li>
<li><span>And in the eighth year of his reign, when he was yet a
boy, he began to seek the God of his father David: and in the
twelfth year after he began to reign, he cleansed Juda and
Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the idols, and
the graven things.</span></li>
<li><span>And they broke down before him the altars of Baalim, and
demolished the idols that had been set upon them: and be cut down
the groves and the graven things, and broke them in pieces: and
strewed the fragments upon the graves of them that had sacrificed
to them.</span></li>
<li><span>And he burnt the bones of the priests on the altars of
the idols, and he cleansed Juda and Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And in the cities of Manasses, and of Ephraim, and of
Simeon, even to Nephtali he demolished all.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he had destroyed the altars, and the groves, and
had broken the idols in pieces, and had demolished all profane
temples throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to
Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had
cleansed the land, and the temple of the Lord, he sent Saphan the
son of Eselias, and Maasias the governor of the city, Joha the son
of Joachaz the recorder, to repair the house of the Lord his
God.</span></li>
<li><span>And they came to Helcias the high priest: and received of
him the money which had been brought into the house of the Lord,
and which the Levites and porters had gathered together from
Manasses, and Ephraim, and all the remnant of Israel, and from all
Juda, and Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem,</span></li>
<li><span>Which they delivered into the hands of them that were
over the workmen in the house of the Lord, to repair the temple,
and mend all that was weak.</span></li>
<li><span>But they gave it to the artificers, and to the masons, to
buy stones out of the quarries, and timber for the couplings of the
building, and to rafter the houses, which the kings of Juda had
destroyed.</span></li>
<li><span>And they did all faithfully. Now the overseers of the
workmen were Jahath and Abdias of the sons of Merari, Zacharias and
Mosollam of the sons of Caath, who hastened the work: all Levites
skilful to play on instruments.</span></li>
<li><span>But over them that carried burdens for divers uses, were
scribes, and masters of the number of the Levites, and
porters.</span></li>
<li><span>Now when they carried out the money that had been brought
into the temple of the Lord, Helcias the priest found the book of
the law of the Lord, by the hand of Moses.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to Saphan the scribe: I have found the book
of the law in the house of the Lord: and he delivered it to
him.</span></li>
<li><span>But he carried the book to the king, and told him,
saying: Lo, all that thou hast committed to thy servants, is
accomplished.</span></li>
<li><span>They have gathered together the silver that was found in
the house of the Lord: and it is given to the overseers of the
artificers, and of the workmen, for divers works.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover Helcias the priest gave me this book. And he
read it before the king.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he had heard the words of the law, he rent his
garments:</span></li>
<li><span>And he commanded Helcias, and Ahicam the son of Saphan,
and Abdon the son of Micha, and Saphan the scribe, and Asaa the
king's servant, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Go, and pray to the Lord for me, and for the remnant of
Israel, and Juda, concerning all the words of this book, which is
found: for the great wrath of the Lord hath fallen upon us, because
our fathers have not kept the words of the Lord, to do all things
that are written in this book.</span></li>
<li><span>And Helcias and they that were sent with him by the king,
went to Olda the prophetess, the wife of Sellum the son of
Thecuath, the son of Hasra keeper of the wardrobe: who dwelt in
Jerusalem in the Second part: and they spoke to her the words above
mentioned.</span></li>
<li><span>And she answered them: Thus saith the Lord the God of
Israel: Tell the man that sent you to me:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: Behold I will bring evils upon this
place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, and all the curses that
are written in this book which they read before the king of
Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>Because they have forsaken me, and have sacrificed to
strange gods, to provoke me to wrath with all the works of their
hands, therefore my wrath shall fall upon this place, and shall not
be quenched.</span></li>
<li><span>But as to the king of Juda that sent you to beseech the
Lord, thus shall you say to him: Thus saith the Lord the God of
Israel: Because thou hast heard the words of this book,</span></li>
<li><span>And thy heart was softened. and thou hast humbled thyself
in the sight of God for the things that are spoken against this
place, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and reverencing my face,
hast rent thy garments, and wept before me: I also have heard thee,
saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>For now I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt
be brought to thy tomb in peace: and thy eyes shall not see all the
evil that I will bring upon this place, and the inhabitants
thereof. They therefore reported to the king all that she had
said.</span></li>
<li><span>And he called together all the ancients of Juda and
Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And went up to the house of the Lord, and all the men of
Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests and the
Levites, and all the people from the least to the greatest. And the
king read in their hearing, in the house of the Lord, all the words
of the book.</span></li>
<li><span>And standing up in his tribunal, he made a covenant
before the Lord to walk after him, and keep his commandments, and
testimonies, and justifications with all his heart, and with all
his soul, and to do the things that were written in that book which
he had read.</span></li>
<li><span>And he adjured all that were found in Jerusalem and
Benjamin to do the same: and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did
according to the covenant of the Lord the God of their
fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josias took away all the abominations out of all the
countries of the children of Israel: and made all that were left in
Israel, to serve the Lord their God. As long as he lived they
departed not from the Lord the God of their fathers.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="35">2 Paralipomenon 35</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And Josias kept a phase to the Lord in Jerusalem, and it
was sacrificed on the fourteenth day of the first
month.</span></li>
<li><span>And he set the priests in their offices, and exhorted
them to minister in the house of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And he spoke to the Levites, by whose instruction all
Israel was sanctified to the Lord, saying: Put the ark in the
sanctuary of the temple, which Solomon the son of David king of
Israel built : for you shall carry it no more: but minister now to
the Lord your God, and to his people Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And prepare yourselves by your houses, and families
according to your courses, as David king of Israel commanded, and
Solomon his son hath written.</span></li>
<li><span>And serve ye in the sanctuary by the families and
companies of Levi.</span></li>
<li><span>And being sanctified kill the phase, and prepare your
brethren, that they may do according to the words which the Lord
spoke by the hand of Moses.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josias gave to all the people that were found there
in the solemnity of the phase, of lambs and of kids of the flocks,
and of other small cattle thirty thousand, and of oxen three
thousand, all these were of the king's substance.</span></li>
<li><span>And his princes willingly offered what they had vowed,
both to the people and to the priests and the Levites. Moreover
Helcias, and Zacharias, and Jahiel rulers of the house of the Lord,
gave to the priests to keep the phase two thousand six hundred
small cattle, and three hundred oxen.</span></li>
<li><span>And Chonenias, and Semeias and Nathanael, his brethren,
and Hasabias, and Jehiel, and Jozabad princes of the Levites, gave
to the rest of the Levites to celebrate the phase five thousand
small cattle, and five hundred oxen.</span></li>
<li><span>And the ministry was prepared, and the priests stood in
their office: the Levites also in their companies, according to the
king's commandment.</span></li>
<li><span>And the phase was immolated: and the priests sprinkled
the blood with their hand, and the Levites flayed the
holocausts:</span></li>
<li><span>And they separated them to give them by the houses and
families of every one, and to be offered to the Lord, as it is
written in the book of Moses, and with the oxen they did in like
manner.</span></li>
<li><span>And they roasted the phase with fire, according to that
which is written in the law: but the victims of peace offerings
they boiled in caldrons, and kettles, and pots, and they
distributed them speedily among all the people.</span></li>
<li><span>And afterwards they made ready for themselves, and for
the priests: for the priests were busied in offering of holocausts
and the fat until night: wherefore the Levites prepared for
themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron last.</span></li>
<li><span>And the singers the sons of Asaph stood in their order,
according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and
Idithun the prophets of the king: and the porters kept guard at
every gate, so as not to depart one moment from their service: and
therefore their brethren the Levites prepared meats for
them.</span></li>
<li><span>So all the service of the Lord was duly accomplished that
day, both in keeping the phase, and offering holocausts upon the
altar of the Lord, according to the commandment of king
Josias.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Israel that were found there, kept
the phase at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven
days.</span></li>
<li><span>There was no phase like to this in Israel, from the days
of Samuel the prophet: neither did any of all the kings of Israel
keep such a phase as Josias kept, with the priests, and the
Levites, and all Juda, and Israel that were found, and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josias was this
phase celebrated.</span></li>
<li><span>After that Josias had repaired the temple, Nechao king of
Egypt came up to fight in Charcamis by the Euphrates: and Josias
went out to meet him.</span></li>
<li><span>But he sent messengers to him, saying: What have I to do
with thee, O king of Juda? I come not against thee this day, but I
fight against another house, to which God hath commanded me to go
in haste : forbear to do against God, who is with me, lest he kill
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Josias would not return, but prepared to fight against
him, and hearkened not to the words of Nechao from the mouth of
God, I but went to fight in the field of Mageddo.</span></li>
<li><span>And there he was wounded by the archers, and he said to
his servants: Carry me out of the battle, for I am grievously
wounded.</span></li>
<li><span>And they removed him from the chariot into another, that
followed him after the manner of kings, and they carried him away
to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in the monument of his
fathers, and all Juda and Jerusalem mourned for him,</span></li>
<li><span>Particularly Jeremias: whose lamentations for Josias all
the singing men and singing women repeat unto this day, and it
became like a law in Israel: Behold it is found written in the
Lamentations.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the rest of the acts of Josias and of his mercies,
according to what was commanded by the law of the Lord:</span></li>
<li><span>And his works first and last, are written in the book of
the kings of Juda and Israel.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="36">2 Paralipomenon 36</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Then the people of the land took Joachaz the son of
Josias, and made him king instead of his father in
Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>Joachaz was three and twenty years old when he began to
reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king of Egypt came to Jerusalem, and deposed him,
and condemned the land in a hundred talents of silver, and a talent
of gold.</span></li>
<li><span>And he made Eliakim his brother king in his stead, over
Juda and Jerusalem: and he turned his name to Joakim: but he took
Joachaz with him, and carried him away into Egypt.</span></li>
<li><span>Joakim was five and twenty years old when he began to
reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did evil
before the Lord his God.</span></li>
<li><span>Against him came up Nabuchodonosor king of the Chaldeans,
and led him bound in chains into Babylon.</span></li>
<li><span>And he carried also thither the vessels of the Lord, and
put them in his temple.</span></li>
<li><span>But the rest of the acts of Joakim, and his abominations,
which he wrought, and the things that were found in him, are
contained in the book of the kings of Juda and Israel. And Joachin
his son reigned in his stead.</span></li>
<li><span>Joachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and
he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem, and he did evil
in the sight of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And at the return of the year, king Nabuchodonosor sent,
and brought him to Babylon, carrying away at the same time the most
precious vessels of the house of the Lord: and he made Sedecias his
uncle king over Juda and Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>Sedecias was one and twenty years old when he began to
reign: and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And he did evil in the eyes of the Lord his God, and did
not reverence the face of Jeremias the prophet speaking to him from
the mouth of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Re also revolted from king Nabuchodonosor, who had made
him swear by God: and he hardened his neck and his heart, from
returning to the Lord the God of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people
wickedly transgressed according to all the abominations of the
Gentiles: and they defiled the house of the Lord, which he had
sanctified to himself in Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord the God of their fathers sent to them, by
the hand of his messengers, rising early, and daily admonishing
them: because he spared his people and his dwelling
place.</span></li>
<li><span>But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his
words, and misused the prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose
against his people, and there was no remedy.</span></li>
<li><span>For he brought upon them the king of the Chaldeans, and
he slew their young men with the sword in the house of his
sanctuary, he had no compassion on young man, or maiden, old man or
even him that stooped for age, but he delivered them all into his
hands.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the vessels of the house of the Lord, great and
small, and the treasures of the temple and of the king, and of the
princes he carried away to Babylon.</span></li>
<li><span>And the enemies set fire to the house of God, and broke
down the wall of Jerusalem, burnt all the towers, and whatsoever
was precious they destroyed.</span></li>
<li><span>Whosoever escaped the sword, was led into Babylon, and
there served the king and his sons till the reign of the king of
Persia.</span></li>
<li><span>That the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremias might
be fulfilled, and the land might keep her sabbaths: for all the
days of the desolation she kept a sabbath, till the seventy years
were expired.</span></li>
<li><span>But in the first year d of Cyrus king of the Persians, to
fulfil the word of the Lord, which he had spoken by the mouth of
Jeremias, the Lord stirred up the heart of Cyrus king of the
Persians who commanded it to be proclaimed through all his kingdom,
and by writing also, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith Cyrus king of the Persians: All the kingdoms
of the earth hath the Lord the God of heaven given to me, and he
hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in
Judea: who is there among you of all his people? The Lord his God
be with him, and let him go up.</span></li>
