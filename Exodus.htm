And when she saw the basket in the sedges, she sent one of her maids for it: and when it was brought,<li>She opened it and seeing within it an infant crying, having compassion on it she said: This is one of the babes of the Hebrews.<li>And the child's sister said to her Shall I go and call to thee a Hebrew woman, to nurse the babe ?<li>She answered: Go. The maid went and called her mother.<li>And Pharao's daughter said to her. Take this child and nurse him for me: I will give thee thy wages. The woman took, and nursed the child: and when he was grown up, she delivered him to Pharao's daughter.<li>And she adopted him for a son, and called him Moses, saying: Because I took him out of the water.<li>In those days after Moses was grown up, he went out to his brethren: and saw their affliction, and an Egyptian striking one of the Hebrews his brethren.<li>And when he had looked about this way and that way, and saw no one there, he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.<li>And going out the next day, he saw two Hebrews quarreling: and he said to him that did the wrong: Why strikest thou thy neighbour?<li>But he answered: Who hath appointed thee prince and judge over us: wilt thou kill me, as thou didst yesterday kill the Egyptian? Moses feared, and said: How is this come to be known ?<li>And Pharao heard of this word and sought to kill Moses: but he fled from his sight, and abode in the land of Madian, and he sat down by a well.<li>And the priest of Madian had seven daughters, who came to draw water: and when the troughs were filled, desired to water their father's flocks.<li>And the shepherds came and drove them away: and Moses arose, and defending the maids, watered their sheep.<li>And when they returned to Raguel their father, he said to them: Why are ye come sooner than usual?<li>They answered: A man of Egypt delivered us from the hands of the shepherds: and he drew water also with us, and gave the sheep to drink.<li>But he said: Where is he? why have you let the man go? call him that he may eat bread.<li>And Moses swore that he would dwell with him. And he took Sephora his daughter to wife:<li>And she bore him a son, whom he called Gersam, saying: I have been a stranger in a foreign country. And she bore another, whom he called Eliezer, saying: For the God of my father, my helper hath delivered me out of the hand of Pharao.<li>Now after a long time the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel groaning, cried out because of the works: and their cry went up unto God from the works.<li>And he heard their groaning, and remembered the covenant which he made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<li>And the Lord looked upon the children of Israel, and he knew them.</ol><h2><a name=3>Exodus 3</a></h2><ol><li>Now Moses fed the sheep of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Madian: and he drove the flock to the inner parts of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, Horeb.<li>And the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he saw that the bush was on fire and was not burnt.<li>And Moses said: I will go and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.<li>And when the Lord saw that he went forward to see, he called to him out of the midst of the bush, and said: Moses, Moses. And he answered: Here I am.<li>And he said: Come not nigh hither, put off the shoes from thy feet: for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.<li>And he said: I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Moses hid his face: for he durst not look at God.<li>And the Lord said to him: I have seen the affliction of my people in Egypt, and I have heard their cry because of the rigour of them that are over the works:<li>And knowing their sorrow, I am come down to deliver them out of the hands of the Egyptians, and to bring them out of that land into a good and spacious land, into a land that floweth with milk and honey, to the places of the Chanaanite, and Hethite, and Amorrhite, and Pherezite, and Hevite, and Jebusite.<li>For the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have seen their affliction, wherewith they are oppressed by the Egyptians.<li>But come, and I will send thee to Pharao, that thou mayst bring forth my people, the children of Israel out of Egypt.<li>And Moses said to God: Who am I that I should go to Pharao, and should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?<li>And he said to him: I will be with thee: and this thou shalt have for a sign, that I have sent thee: When thou shalt have brought my people out of Egypt, thou shalt offer sacrifice to God upon this mountain.<li>Moses said to God: Lo, I shall go to the children of Israel, and say to them: The God of your fathers hath sent me to you. If they should say to me: What is his name? what shall I say to them?<li>God said to Moses: I AM WHO AM. He said: Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel: HE WHO IS, hath sent me to you.<li>And God said again to Moses: Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel: The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me to you: This is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.<li>Go, gather together the ancients of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared to me, saying: Visiting I have visited you: and I have seen all that hath befallen you in Egypt.<li>And I have said the word to bring you forth out of the affliction of Egypt, into the land of the Chanaanite, the Hethite, and the Amorrhite, and Pherezite, and Hevite, and Jebusite, to a land that floweth with milk and honey.<li>And they shall hear thy voice: and thou shalt go in, thou and the ancients of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and thou shalt say to him: The Lord God of the Hebrews hath called us: we will go three days' journey into the wilderness, to sacrifice unto the Lord our God.<li>But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, but by a mighty hand.<li>For I will stretch forth my hand and will strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst of them: after these he will let you go.<li>And I will give favour to this people, in the sight of the Egyptians: and when you go forth, you shall not depart empty:<li>But every woman shall ask of her neighbour, and of her that is in her house, vessels of silver and of gold, and raiment: and you shall put them on your sons and daughters, and shall spoil Egypt.</ol><h2><a name=4>Exodus 4</a></h2><ol><li>Moses answered and said: They will not believe me, nor hear my voice, but they will say: The Lord hath not appeared to thee.<li>Then he said to him: What is that thou holdest in thy hand? He answered: A rod.<li>And the Lord said: Cast it down upon the ground. He cast it down, and it was turned into a serpent: so that Moses fled from it.<li>And the Lord said: Put out thy hand and take it by the tail. He put forth his hand, and took hold of it, and it was turned into a rod.<li>That they may believe, saith he, that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared to thee.<li>And the Lord said again: Put thy hand into thy bosom. And when he had put it into his bosom, he brought it forth leprous as snow.<li>And he said: Put back thy hand into thy bosom. He put it back, and brought it out again, and it was like the other flesh.<li>If they will not believe thee, saith he, nor hear the voice of the former sign, they will believe the word of the latter sign.<li>But if they will not even believe these two signs, nor hear thy voice: take of the river water, and pour it out upon the dry land, and whatsoever thou drawest out of the river shall be turned into blood.<li>Moses said: I beseech thee, Lord. I am not eloquent from yesterday and the day before: and since thou hast spoken to thy servant, I have more impediment and slowness of tongue.<li>The Lord said to him: Who made man's mouth? or who made the dumb and the deaf, the seeing and the blind? did not I?<li>Go therefore and I will be in thy mouth: and I will teach thee what thou shalt speak.<li>But he said: I beseech thee, Lord send whom thou wilt send.<li>The Lord being angry at Moses, said Aaron the Levite is thy brother, I know that he is eloquent: behold he cometh forth to meet thee, and seeing thee shall be glad at heart.<li>Speak to him, and put my words in his mouth: and I will be in thy mouth, and in his mouth, and will shew you what you must do.<li>He shall speak in thy stead to the people, and shall be thy mouth: but thou shalt be to him in those things that pertain to God.<li>And take this rod in thy hand, wherewith thou shalt do the signs.<li>Moses went his way, and returned to Jethro his father in law and said to him: I will go and return to my brethren into Egypt, that I may see if they be yet alive. And Jethro said to him: Go in peace.<li>And the Lord said to Moses, in Madian: Go, and return into Egypt: for they are all dead that sought thy life.<li>Moses therefore took his wife, and his sons, and set them upon an ass: and returned into Egypt, carrying the rod of God in his hand.<li>And the Lord said to him as he was returning into Egypt: See that thou do all the wonders before Pharao, which I have put in thy hand: I shall harden his heart, and he will not let the people go.<li>And thou shalt say to him: Thus saith the Lord: Israel is my son, my firstborn.<li>I have said to thee: Let my son go, that he may serve me, and thou wouldst not let him go: behold I will kill thy son, thy firstborn.<li>And when he was in his journey, in the inn, the Lord met him, and would have killed him.<li>Immediately Sephora took a very sharp stone, and circumcised the fore skin of her son, and touched his feet and said: A bloody spouse art thou to me.<li>And he let him go after she had said A bloody spouse art thou to me, because of the circumcision.<li>And the Lord said to Aaron: Go into the desert to meet Moses. And he went forth to meet him in the mountain of God, and kissed him.<li>And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord, by which he had sent him, and the signs that he had commanded.<li>And they came together, and they assembled all the ancients of the children of Israel.<li>And Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had said to Moses: and he wrought the signs before the people,<li>And the people believed. And they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel: and that he had looked upon their affliction: and falling down they adored.</ol><h2><a name=5>Exodus 5</a></h2><ol><li>After these things Moses and Aaron went in, and said to Pharao: Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: Let my people go that they may sacrifice to me in the desert.<li>But he answered: Who is the Lord, that I should hear his voice, and let Israel go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go.<li>And they said: The God of the Hebrews hath called us, to go three days' journey into the wilderness and to sacrifice to the Lord our God: lest a pestilence or the sword fall upon us.<li>The king of Egypt said to them: Why do you Moses and Aaron draw off the people from their works? Get you gone to your burdens.<li>And Pharao said: The people of the land is numerous: you see that the multitude is increased: how much more if you give them rest from their works?<li>Therefore he commanded the same day the overseers of the works, and the taskmasters of the people, saying:<li>You shall give straw no more to the people to make brick, as before: but let them go and gather straw.<li>And you shall lay upon them the task of bricks, which they did before, neither shall you diminish any thing thereof: for they are idle, and therefore they cry, saying: Let us go and sacrifice to our God.<li>Let them be oppressed, with works, and let them fulfill them: that they may not regard lying words.<li>And the overseers of the works and the taskmasters went out and said to the people: Thus saith Pharao, I allow you no straw:<li>Go, and gather it where you can find it: neither shall any thing of your work be diminished.<li>And the people was scattered through all the land of Egypt to gather straw.<li>And the overseers of the works pressed them, saying: Fulfill your work every day as before you were wont to do when straw was given you.<li>And they that were over the works of the children of Israel were scourged by Pharao's taskmasters, saying: Why have you not made up the task of bricks both yesterday and to day as before?<li>And the officers of the children of Israel came, and cried out to Pharao, saying: Why dealest thou so with thy servants?<li>Straw is not given us, and bricks are required of us as before: behold we thy servants are beaten with whips, and thy people is unjustly dealt withal.<li>And he said: You are idle, and therefore you say: Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord.<li>Go therefore, and work: straw shall not be given you, and you shall deliver the accustomed number of bricks.<li>And the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in evil case, because it was said to them: There shall not a whit be diminished of the bricks for every day.<li>And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood over against them as they came out from Pharao:<li>And they said to them: The Lord see and judge, because you have made our savour to stink before Pharao and his servants, and you have given him a sword to kill us.<li>And Moses returned to the Lord, and said: Lord, why hast thou afflicted this people? wherefore hast thou sent me?<li>For since the time that I went in to Pharao to speak in thy name, he hath afflicted thy people: and thou hast not delivered them.</ol><h2><a name=6>Exodus 6</a></h2><ol><li>And the Lord said to Moses: Now thou shalt see what I will do to Pharao: for by a mighty hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he cast them out of his land.<li>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: I am the Lord,<li>That appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, by the name of God Almighty; and my name ADONAI I did not shew them.<li>And I made a covenant with them, to give them the land of Chanaan, the land of their pilgrimage wherein they were strangers.<li>I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, wherewith the Egyptians have oppressed them: and I have remembered my covenant.<li>Therefore say to the children of Israel: I am the Lord who will bring you out from the work prison of the Egyptians, and will deliver you from bondage: and redeem you with a high arm, and great judgments.<li>And I will take you to myself for my people, I will be your God: and you shall know that I am the Lord your God who brought you out from the work prison of the Egyptians.<li>And brought you into the land, concerning which I lifted up my hand to give it to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and I will give it you to possess, I am the Lord.<li>And Moses told all this to the children of Israel: but they did not hearken to him, for anguish of spirit, and most painful work.<li>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying<li>Go in, and speak to Pharao king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.<li>Moses answered before the Lord Behold the children of Israel do no hearken to me; and how will Pharao hear me, especially as I am of uncircumcised lips?<li>And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, and he gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharao the king of Egypt, that they should bring forth the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.<li>These are the heads of their house by their families. The sons of Rubel the firstborn of Israel: Henoch and Phallu, Hesron and Charmi.<li>These are the kindreds of Ruben. The sons of Simeon: Jamuel, and Jamin and Ahod, and Jachin, and Soar, and Saul the son of a chanaanitess: these are the families of Simeon.<li>And these are the names of the sons of Levi by their kindreds: Gerson, and Caath, and Merari. And the years of the life of Levi were a hundred and thirty seven.<li>The sons of Gerson: Lobni and Semei, by their kindreds.<li>The sons of Caath: Amram, and Isaar, and EIebron, and Oziel. And the years of Caath's life were a hundred and thirty-three.<li>The sons of Merari: Moholi and Musi. These are the kindreds of Levi by their families.<li>And Amram took to wife Jochabed his aunt by the father's side: and she bore him Aaron and Moses. And the years of Amram's life were a hundred and thirty-seven.<li>The sons also of Isaar: Core, and Nepheg, and Zechri.<li>The sons also of Oziel: Mizael, and Elizaphan, and Sethri.<li>And Aaron took to wife Elizabeth the daughter of Aminadab, sister of Nahason, who bore him Nadab, and Abiu, and Eleazar, and Ithamar.<li>The sons also of Core: Aser, and Elcana, and Abiasaph. These are the kindreds of the Corites.<li>But Eleazar the son of Aaron took a wife of the daughters of Phutiel: and she bore him Phinees. These are the heads of the Levitical families by their kindreds.<li>These are Aaron and Moses, whom the Lord commanded to bring forth the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their companies.<li>These are they that speak to Pharao king of Egypt, in order to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron<li>In the day when the Lord spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt.<li>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: I am the Lord: speak thou to Pharao king of Egypt all that I say to thee.<li>And Moses said before the Lord: Lo I am of uncircumcised lips, how will Pharao hear me?</ol><h2><a name=7>Exodus 7</a></h2><ol><li>And the Lord said to Moses: Behold I have appointed thee the God of Pharao: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.<li>Thou shalt speak to him all that I command thee; and he shall speak to Pharao, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.<li>But I shall harden his heart, and shall multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt,<li>And he will not hear you: and I will lay my hand upon Egypt, and will bring forth my army and my people the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, by very great judgments.<li>And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, who have stretched forth my hand upon Egypt, and have brought forth the children of Israel out of the midst of them.<li>And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord had commanded: so did they.<li>And Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three, when they spoke to Pharao.<li>And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron:<li>When Pharao shall say to you, Shew signs: thou shalt say to Aaron: Take thy rod, and cast it down before Pharao, and it shall be turned into a serpent.<li>So Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharao, and did as the Lord had commanded. And Aaron took the rod before Pharao, and his servants, and it was turned into a serpent.<li>And Pharao called the wise men and the magicians: and they also by Egyptian enchantments and certain secrets did in like manner.<li>And they every one cast down their rods, and they were turned into serpents: but Aaron's rod devoured their rods.<li>And Pharao's heart was hardened, and he did not hearken to them, as the Lord had commanded.<li>And the Lord said to Moses: Pharao's heart is hardened, he will not let the people go.<li>Go to him in the morning, behold he will go out to the waters: and thou shalt stand to meet him on the bank of the river: and thou shalt take in thy hand the rod that was turned into a serpent.<li>And thou shalt say to him: The Lord God of the Hebrews sent me to thee saying: Let my people go to sacrifice to me in the desert: and hitherto thou wouldst not hear.<li>Thus therefore saith the Lord: In this thou shalt know that I am the Lord: behold I will strike with the rods that is in my hand, the water of the river, and it shall be turned into blood.<li>And the fishes that are in the river shall die, and the waters shall be corrupted, and the Egyptians shall be afflicted when they drink the water of the river.<li>The Lord also said to Moses: Say to Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch forth thy hand upon the waters of Egypt, and upon their rivers, and streams and pools, and all the ponds of waters, that they may be turned into blood: and let blood be in all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and of stone.<li>And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord had commanded: and lifting up the rod he struck the water of the river before Pharao and his servants: and it was turned into blood.<li>And the fishes that were in the river died: and the river corrupted, and the Egyptians could not drink the water of the river, and there was blood in all the land of Egypt.<li>And the magicians of the Egyptians with their enchantments did in like manner: and Pharao's heart was hardened, neither did he hear them, as the Lord had commanded.<li>And he turned himself away and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to it this time also.<li>And all the Egyptians dug round about the river for water to drink: for they could not drink of the water of the river.<li>And seven days were fully ended, after that the Lord struck the river.</ol><h2><a name=8>Exodus 8</a></h2><ol><li>And the Lord said to Moses: Go in to Pharao, and thou shalt say to him: Thus saith the Lord: Let my people go to sacrifice to me.<li>But if thou wilt not let them go behold I will strike all thy coasts with frogs.<li>And the river shall bring forth an abundance of frogs: which shall come up, and enter into thy house, and thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and in the houses of thy servants, and to thy people, and into thy ovens, and into the remains of thy meats;<li>And the frogs shall come in to thee and to thy people, and to all thy servants.<li>And the Lord said to Moses: Say to Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand upon the streams and upon the rivers and the pools, and bring forth frogs upon the land of Egypt.<li>And Aaron stretched forth his hand upon the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.<li>And the magicians also by their enchantments did in like manner, and the brought forth frogs upon all the land of Egypt<li>But Pharao called Moses and Aaron and said to them: Pray ye to the Lord to take away the frogs from me and from my people; and I will let the people go to sacrifice to the Lord.<li>And Moses said to Pharao: Set me a time when I shall pray for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, that the frogs may be driven away from thee and from thy house, and from thy servants, and from thy people: and may remain only in the river.<li>And he answered: Tomorrow. But he said: I will do according to thy word; that thou mayst know that there is none like to the Lord our God.<li>And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy house, and from thy servants, and from thy people; and shall remain only in the river.<li>And Moses and Aaron went forth from Pharao: and Moses cried to the Lord for the promise, which he had made to Pharao concerning the frogs.<li>And the Lord did according to the word of Moses: and the frogs died out of the houses, and out of the villages, and out of the fields:<li>And they gathered them together into immense heaps, and the land was corrupted.<li>And Pharao seeing that rest was given, hardened his own heart, and did not hear them, as the Lord had commanded.<li>And the Lord said to Moses: Say to Aaron, Stretch forth thy rod, and strike the dust of the earth: and may there be sciniphs in all the land of Egypt.<li>And they did so. And Aaron stretched forth his hand, holding the rod: and he struck the dust of the earth, and there came sciniphs on men and on beasts: all the dust of the earth was turned into sciniphs through all the land of Egypt.<li>And the magicians with their enchantments practiced in like manner, to bring forth sciniphs, and they could not and there were sciniphs as well on men as on beasts.<li>And the magicians said to Pharao This is the finger of God. And Pharao heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them, as the Lord had commanded.<li>The Lord also said to Moses: Arise early, and stand before Pharao: for he will go forth to the waters: and thou shalt say to him: Thus saith the Lord: Let my people go to sacrifice to me.<li>But if thou wilt not let them go, behold I will send in upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy houses all kind of flies: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be filled with flies of divers kinds, and the whole land wherein they shall be.<li>And I will make the land of Gessen wherein my people is, wonderful in that lay, so that flies shall not be there: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth.<li>And I will put a division between my people and thy people: tomorrow shall this sign be.<li>And the Lord did so. And there came a very grievous swarm of flies into he houses of Pharao and of his servants, and into all the land of Egypt: and the land was corrupted by this kind of flies.<li>And Pharao called Moses and Aaron, and said to them: Go, and sacrifice to your God in this land.<li>And Moses said: It cannot be so: for we shall sacrifice the abominations of the Egyptians to the Lord our God: now if we kill those things which the Egyptians worship, in their presence, they will stone us.<li>We will go three days' journey into the wilderness: and we will sacrifice to the Lord our God, as he hath commanded us.<li>And Pharao said: I will let you go to sacrifice to the Lord your God in the wilderness: but go no farther: pray for me.<li>And Moses said: I will go out from thee, and will pray to the Lord: and the flies shall depart from Pharao, and from his servants, and from his people tomorrow: but do not deceive any more, in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the Lord.<li>So Moses went out from Pharao, and prayed to the Lord.<li>And he did according to his word: and he took away the flies from Pharao, and from his servants, and from his people: there was not left so much as one.<li>And Pharao's heart was hardened, so that neither this time would he let the people go.</ol><h2><a name=9>Exodus 9</a></h2><ol><li>And the Lord said to Moses: Go in to Pharao, and speak to him: Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews: Let my people go to sacrifice to me.<li>But if thou refuse, and withhold them still:<li>Behold my hand shall be upon thy fields: and a very grievous murrain upon thy horses, and asses, and camels, and oxen, and sheep.<li>And the Lord will make a wonderful difference between the possessions of Israel and the possessions of the Egyptians, that nothing at all shall die of those things that belong to the children of Israel.<li>And the Lord appointed a time, saying: Tomorrow will the Lord do this thing in the land.<li>The Lord therefore did this thing the next day: and all the beasts of the Egyptians died, but of the beasts of the children of Israel there died not one.<li>And Pharao sent to see: and there was not any thing dead of that which Israel possessed. And Pharao's heart was hardened, and he did not let the people go.<li>And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron: Take to you handfuls of ashes out of the chimney, and let Moses sprinkle it in the air in the presence of Pharao.<li>And be there dust upon all the land of Egypt: for there shall be boils and swelling blains both in men and beasts in the whole land of Egypt.<li>And they took ashes out of the chimney, and stood before Pharao, and Moses sprinkled it in the air: and there came boils with swelling blains in men and beasts.<li>Neither could the magicians stand before Moses for the boils that were upon them, and in all the land of Egypt.<li>And the Lord hardened Pharao's heart, and he hearkened not unto them, as the Lord had spoken to Moses.<li>And the Lord said to Moses: Arise in the morning, and stand before Pharao, and thou shalt say to him: Thus saith the Lord the God of the Hebrews: Let my people go to sacrifice to me.<li>For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thy heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people: that thou mayst know there is none like me in all the earth.<li>For now I will stretch out my hand to strike thee, and thy people with pestilence, and thou shalt perish from the earth.<li>And therefore have I raised thee, that I may shew my power in thee, and my name may be spoken of throughout all the earth.<li>Dost thou yet hold back my people: and wilt thou not let them go?<li>Behold I will cause it to rain to morrow at this same hour, an exceeding great hail: such as hath not been in Egypt from the day that it was founded, until this present time.<li>Send therefore now presently, and gather together thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field: for men and beasts, and all things that shall be found abroad, and not gathered together out of the fields, which the hail shall fall upon, shall die.<li>He that feared the word of the Lord among Pharao's servants, made his servants and his cattle flee into houses:<li>And the Lord said to Moses: Stretch forth thy hand towards heaven, that there may be hail in the whole land of Egypt, upon men, and upon beasts, and upon every herb of the field in the land of Egypt.<li>And Moses stretched forth his rod towards heaven, and the Lord sent thunder and hail, and lightning running along the ground: and the Lord rained hail upon the land of Egypt.<li>And the hail and fire mixed with it drove on together: and it was of so great bigness, as never before was seen in the whole land of Egypt since that nation was founded.<li>And the hail destroyed through all the land of Egypt all things that were in the fields, both man and beast: and the hail smote every herb of the field, and it broke every tree of the country.<li>Only in the land of Gessen, where the children of Israel were, the hail fell not.<li>And Pharao sent and called Moses and Aaron, saying to them: I have sinned this time also; the Lord is just: I and my people are wicked.<li>Pray ye to the Lord, that the thunderings of God and the hail may cease: that I may let you go, and that you may stay here no longer.<li>Moses said: As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will stretch forth my hands to the Lord, and the thunders shall cease, and the hail shall be no more: that thou mayst know that the earth is the Lord's.<li>But I know that neither thou, nor thy servants do yet fear the Lord God.<li>The flax therefore and the barley were hurt, because the barley was green, and the flax was now boiled:<li>But the wheat, and other winter corn were not hurt, because they were lateward.<li>And when Moses was gone from Pharao out of the city, he stretched forth his hands to the Lord: and the thunders and the hail ceased, neither did there drop any more rain upon the earth.<li>And Pharao seeing that the rain and the hail, and the thunders were ceased, increased his sin.<li>And his heart was hardened, and the heart of his servants, and it was made exceeding hard: neither did he let the children of Israel go, as the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses.</ol><h2><a name=10>Exodus 10</a></h2><ol><li>And the Lord said to Moses: Go in to Pharao; for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants: that I may work these my signs in him.<li>And thou mayest tell in the ears of thy sons, and of they grandsons, how often I have plagued the Egyptians, and wrought my signs amongst them: and you may know that I am the Lord:<li>Therefore Moses and Aaron went in to Pharao, and said to him: Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews: How long refusest thou to submit to me? let my people go, to sacrifice to me.<li>But if thou resist, and wilt not let them go, behold I will bring in to morrow the locust into thy coasts:<li>To cover the face of the earth that nothing thereof may appear, but that which the hail hath left may be eaten: for they shall feed upon all the trees that spring in the fields.<li>And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of thy servants, and of all the Egyptians: such a number as thy fathers have not seen, nor thy grandfathers, from the time they were first upon the earth, until this present day.

And immediately they were cast out from Pharao's presence.<li>And the Lord said to Moses: Stretch forth thy hand upon the land of Egypt unto the locust, that it may come upon it, and devour every herb that is left after the hail.<li>And Moses stretched forth his rod upon the land of Egypt: and the Lord brought a burning wind all that day, and night: and when it was morning, the burning wind raised the locusts:<li>And they came up over the whole land of Egypt: and rested in all the coasts of the Egyptians innumerable, the like as had not been before that time, nor shall be hereafter.<li>And they covered the whole face of the earth, wasting all things. And the grass of the earth was devoured, and what fruits soever were on the trees, which the hail had left: and there remained not any thing that was green on the trees, or in the herbs of the earth in all Egypt.<li>Wherefore Pharao in haste called Moses and Aaron, and said to them: I have sinned against the Lord your God, and against you.<li>But now forgive me my sin this time also, and pray to the Lord your God, that he take away from me this death.<li>And Moses going forth from the presence of Pharao, prayed to the Lord.<li>And he made a very strong wind to blow from the west, and it took the locusts and cast them into the Red Sea: there remained not so much as one in all the coasts of Egypt.<li>And the Lord hardened Pharao's heart, neither did he let the children of Israel go.<li>And the Lord said to Moses: Stretch out they hand towards heaven: and may there be darkness upon the land of Egypt, so thick that it may be felt.<li>And Moses stretch forth his hand towards heaven: and there came horrible darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days.<li>No man saw his brother, nor moved himself out of the place where he was: but wheresoever the children of Israel dwelt there was light.<li>And Pharao called Moses and Aaron, and said to them: Go sacrifice to the Lord: let your sheep only, and herds remain; let your children go with you.<li>Moses said: Thou shalt give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, to the Lord our God.<li>All the flocks shall go with us: there shall not a hoof remain of them: for they are necessary for the service of the Lord our God: especially as we know not what must be offered, till we come to the very place.<li>And the Lord hardened Pharao's heart, and he would not let them go.<li>And Pharao said to Moses: Get thee from me, and beware thou see not my face any more: in what day soever thou shalt come in my sight, thou shalt die.<li>Moses answered: So shall it be as thou hast spoken, I will not see thy face any more.</ol><h2><a name=11>Exodus 11</a></h2><ol><li>And the Lord said to Moses: Yet one plague more will I bring upon Pharao and Egypt, and after that he shall let you go and thrust you out.<li>Therefore thou shalt tell all the people that every man ask of his friend, and every woman of her neighbour, vessels of silver, and of gold.<li>And the Lord will give favour to his people in the sight of the Egyptians.

But the Lord said to Moses: Pharao will not hear you, that many signs may be done in the land of Egypt.<li>And Moses and Aaron did all the wonders that are written, before Pharao.

children.<li>And a mixed multitude without number went up also with them, sheep and herds and beasts of divers kinds, exceeding many.<li>And they baked the meal, which a little before they had brought

And Aaron put it in the tabernacle to be kept.<li>And the children of Israel ate manna forty years, till they came to a habitable land: with this meat were they fed, until they reached the borders of the land of Chanaan.<li>Now a gomor is the tenth part of an ephi.</ol><h2><a name=17>Exodus 17</a></h2><ol><li>Then all the multitude of the children of Israel setting forward from the desert of Sin, by their mansions, according to the word of the Lord, encamped in Raphidim, where there was no water for the people to drink.<li>And they chode with Moses, and said: Give us water, that we may drink. And Moses answered them: Why chide you with me? Wherefore do you tempt the Lord?<li>So the people were thirsty there for want of water, and murmured against Moses, saying: Why didst thou make us go forth out of Egypt, to kill us and our children, and our beasts with thirst?<li>And Moses cried to the Lord, saying: What shall I do to this people? Yet a little more and they will stone me.<li>And the Lord said to Moses: God before the people, and take with thee of the ancients of Israel: and take in thy hand the rod wherewith thou didst strike the river, and go.<li>Behold I will stand there before thee, upon the rock Horeb: and thou shalt strike the rock, and water shall come out of it that the people may drink. Moses did so before the ancients of Israel:<li>And he called the name of that place Temptation, because the chiding of the children of Israel, and for that they tempted the Lord, saying: Is the Lord amongst us or not?<li>And Amalec came, and fought against Israel in Raphidim.<li>And Moses said to Josue: Choose out men: and go out and fight against Amalec: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill having the rod of God in my hand.<li>Josue did as Moses had spoken, and he fought against Amalec; but Moses, and Aaron, and Hur went up upon the top of the hill.<li>And when Moses lifted up his hands, Israel overcame: but if he let them down a little, Amalec overcame.<li>And Moses' hands were heavy: so they took a stone, and put under him, and he sat on it: and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands on both sides. And it came to pass that his hands were not weary until sunset.<li>And Josue put Amalec and his people to flight, by the edge of the sword.<li>And the Lord said to Moses: Write this for a memorial in a book, and deliver it to the ears of Josue: for I will destroy the memory of Amalec from under heaven.<li>And Moses built an altar: and called the name thereof, The Lord my exaltation, saying:<li>Because the hand of the throne of the Lord, and the war of the Lord shall be against Amalec, from generation to generation.</ol><h2><a name=18>Exodus 18</a></h2><ol><li>And when Jethro the priest of Madian, the kinsman of Moses, had heard all the things that God had done to Moses, and to Israel his people, and that the Lord had brought forth Israel out of Egypt,<li>He took Sephora the wife of Moses whom he had sent back:<li>And her two sons, of whom one was called Gersam, his father saying: I have been a stranger in a foreign country.<li>And the other Eliezer: For the God of my father, said he, is my helper, and hath delivered me from the sword of Pharao.<li>And Jethro the kinsman of Moses came with his sons and his wife, to Moses into the desert, where he was camped by the mountain of God.<li>And he sent word to Moses, saying: I Jethro thy kinsman come to thee, and thy wife, and thy two sons with her.<li>And he went out to meet his kinsman, and worshipped and kissed him: and they saluted one another with words of peace.

Why sittest thou alone, and all the people wait from morning till night.<li>And Moses answered him: The people come to me to seek the judgment of God.<li>And when any controversy falleth out among them, they come to me to judge between them, and to shew the precepts of God, and his laws.<li>But he said: The thing thou dost is not good.<li>Thou are spent with foolish labour, both thou and this people that is with thee: the business is above thy strength, thou alone canst not bear it.<li>But hear my words and counsels, and God shall be with thee.

And thou shalt cleanse the altar when thou hast offered the victim of expiation, and shalt anoint it to sanctify it.<li>Seven days shalt thou expiate the altar and sanctify it, and it shall be most holy. Every one that shall touch it shall be holy.<li>This is what thou shalt sacrifice upon the altar: Two lambs of a year old every day continually.<li>One lamb in the morning and another in the evening.<li>With one lamb a tenth part of flour tempered with beaten oil, of the fourth part of a hin, and wine for libation of the same measure.<li>And the other lamb thou shalt offer in the evening, according to the rite of the morning oblation, and according to what we have said, for a savour of sweetness:<li>It is a sacrifice to the Lord, by perpetual oblation unto your generations, at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony before the Lord, where I will appoint to speak unto thee.<li>And there will I command the children of Israel, and the altar shall be sanctified by my glory.<li>I will sanctify also the tabernacle of the testimony with the altar, and Aaron with his sons, to do the office of priesthood unto me.<li>And I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel, and will be their God:<li>And they shall know that I am the Lord their God, who have brought them out of the land of Egypt, that I might abide among them, I the Lord their God.</ol><h2><a name=30>Exodus 30</a></h2><ol><li>Thou shalt make also an altar to burn incense, of setim wood.<li>It shall be a cubit in length, and another in breadth, that is, foursquare, and two in height. Horns shall go out of the same.<li>And thou shalt overlay it with the purest gold, as well as the grate thereof, as the walls round about and the horns. And thou shalt make to it a crown of gold round about,<li>And two golden rings under the crown on either side, that the bars may be put into them, and the altar be carried.<li>And thou shalt make the bars also of setim wood, and shalt overlay them with gold.<li>And thou shalt set the altar over against the veil, that hangeth before the ark of the testimony before the propitiatory wherewith the testimony is covered, where I will speak to thee.<li>And Aaron shall burn sweet smelling incense upon it in the morning. When he shall dress the lamps, he shall burn it:<li>And when he shall place them in the evening, he shall burn an everlasting incense before the Lord throughout your generations.<li>You shall not offer upon it incense of another composition nor oblation, and victim, neither shall you offer libations.<li>And Aaron shall pray upon the horns thereof once a year, with the blood of that which was offered for sin, and shall make atonement upon it in your generations. It shall be most holy to the Lord.<li>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:<li>When thou shalt take the sum of the children of Israel according to their number, every one of them shall give a price for their souls to the Lord, and there shall be no scourge among them, when they shall be reckoned.<li>And this shall every one give that passeth at the naming, half a sicle according to the standard of the temple. A sicle hath twenty obols. Half a sicle shall be offered to the Lord.<li>He that is counted in the number from twenty years and upwards, shall give the price.<li>The rich man shall not add to half a sicle, and the poor man shall diminish nothing.<li>And the money received which was contributed by the children of Israel, thou shalt deliver unto the uses of the tabernacle of the testimony, that it may be a memorial of them before the Lord, and he may be merciful to their souls.<li>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:<li>Thou shalt make also a brazen laver with its foot, to wash in: and thou shalt set it between the tabernacle of the testimony and the altar. And water being put into it,<li>Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and feet in it:<li>When they are going into the tabernacle of the testimony, and when they are to come to the altar, to offer on it incense to the Lord,<li>Lest perhaps they die. It shall be an everlasting law to him, and to his seed by successions.<li>And the Lord spoke to Moses,<li>Saying: Take spices, of principal and chosen myrrh five hundred sicles, and of cinnamon half so much, that is, two hundred and fifty sicles, of calamus in like manner two hundred and fifty.<li>And of cassia five hundred sicles by the weight of the sanctuary, of oil of olives the measure hin:<li>And thou shalt make the holy oil of unction, an ointment compounded after the art of the perfumer,<li>And therewith thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the testimony, and the ark of the testament,<li>And the table with the vessels thereof, the candlestick and furniture thereof, the altars of incense,<li>And of holocaust, and all the furniture that belongeth to the service of them.<li>And thou shalt sanctify all, and they shall be most holy: he that shall touch them shall be sanctified.<li>Thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and shalt sanctify them, that they may do the office of priesthood unto me.<li>And thou shalt say to the children of Israel: This oil of unction shall be holy unto me throughout your generations.<li>The flesh of man shall not be anointed therewith, and you shall make none other of the same composition, because it is sanctified, and shall be holy unto you.<li>What man soever shall compound such, and shall give thereof to a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people.<li>And the Lord said to Moses: Take unto thee spices, stacte, and onycha, galbanum of sweet savour, and the clearest frankincense, all shall be of equal weight.<li>And thou shalt make incense compounded by the work of the perfumer, well tempered together, and pure, and most worthy of sanctification.<li>And when thou has beaten all into very small powder, thou shalt set of it before the tabernacle of the testimony, in the place where I will appear to thee. Most holy shall this incense be to you.<li>You shall not make such a composition for your own uses, because it is holy to the Lord.<li>What man soever shall make the like, to enjoy the smell thereof, he shall perish out of his people.</ol><h2><a name=31>Exodus 31</a></h2><ol><li>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:<li>Behold, I have called by name Beseleel the son of Uri the son of Hur of the tribe of Juda,<li>And I have filled him with the spirit of God, with wisdom and understanding, and knowledge in all manner of work.<li>To devise whatsoever may be artificially made of gold, and silver, and brass,<li>Of marble, and precious stones, and variety of wood.<li>And I have given him for his companion Ooliab the son of Achisamech of the tribe of Dan.

Every one that shall do any work on this day, shall die.<li>Let the children of Israel keep the sabbath, and celebrate it in their generations. It is an everlasting covenant<li>Between me and the children of Israel, and a perpetual sign. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and in the seventh he ceased from work.<li>And the Lord, when he had ended these words in mount Sinai, gave to Moses two stone tables of testimony, written with the finger of God.</ol><h2><a name=32>Exodus 32</a></h2><ol><li>And the people seeing that Moses delayed to come down from the mount, gathering together against Aaron, said: Arise, make us gods, that may go before us: for as to this Moses, the man that brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what has befallen him.<li>And Aaron said to them: Take the golden earrings from the ears of your wives, and your sons and daughters, and bring them to me.<li>And the people did what he had commanded, bringing the earrings to Aaron.<li>And when he had received them, he fashioned them by founders' work, and made of them a molten calf. And they said: These are thy gods, O Israel, that have brought thee out of the land of Egypt.<li>And when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it, and made proclamation by a crier's voice, saying: To morrow is the solemnity of the Lord.<li>And rising in the morning, they offered holocausts, and peace victims, and the people sat down to eat, and drink, and they rose up to play.<li>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: Go, get thee down: thy people, which thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt, hath sinned.<li>They have quickly strayed from the way which thou didst shew them: and they have made to themselves a molten calf, and have adored it, and sacrificing victims to it, have said: These are thy gods, O Israel, that have brought thee out of the land of Egypt.<li>And again the Lord said to Moses: See that this people is stiffnecked:<li>Let me alone, that my wrath may be kindled against them, and that I may destroy them, and I will make of thee a great nation.<li>But Moses besought the Lord his God, saying: Why, O Lord, is thy indignation kindled against thy people, whom thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt, with great power, and with a mighty hand?<li>Let not the Egyptians say, I beseech thee: He craftily brought them out, that he might kill them in the mountains, and destroy them from the earth: let thy anger cease, and be appeased upon the wickedness of thy people.<li>Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou sworest by thy own self, saying: I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven: and this whole land that I have spoken of, I will give to you seed, and you shall possess it for ever.<li>And the Lord was appeased from doing the evil which he had spoken against his people.<li>And Moses returned from the mount, carrying the two tables of the testimony in his hand, written on both sides,<li>And made by the work of God: the writing also of God was graven in the tables.<li>And Josue hearing the noise of the people shouting, said to Moses: The noise of battle is heard in the camp.<li>But he answered: It is not the cry of men encouraging to fight, nor the shout of men compelling to flee: but I hear the voice of singers.<li>And when he came nigh to the camp, he saw the calf, and the dances: and being very angry, he threw the tables out of his hand, and broke them at the foot of the mount:<li>And laying hold of the calf which they had made, he burnt it, and beat it to powder, which he strowed into water, and gave thereof to the children of Israel to drink.<li>And he said to Aaron: What has this people done to thee, that thou shouldst bring upon them a most heinous sin?<li>And he answered him: Let not my lord be offended: for thou knowest this people, that they are prone to evil.<li>They said to me: Make us gods, that may go before us: for as to this Moses, who brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is befallen him.<li>And I said to them: Which of you hath any gold? and they took and brought it to me: and I cast it into the fire, and this calf came out.<li>And when Moses saw that the people were naked, (for Aaron had stripped them by occasion of the shame of the filth, and had set them naked among their enemies,)<li>Then standing in the gate of the camp, he said: If any man be on the Lord's side let him join with me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him:<li>And he said to them: Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: Put every man his sword upon his thigh: go, and return from gate to gate through the midst of the camp, and let every man kill his brother, and friend, and neighbour.<li>And the sons of Levi did according to the words of Moses, and there were slain that day about three and twenty thousand men.<li>And Moses said: You have consecrated your hands this day to the Lord, every man in his son and in his brother, that a blessing may be given to you.<li>And when the next day was come, Moses spoke to the people: You have sinned a very great sin: I will go up to the Lord, if by any means I may be able to entreat him for your crime.<li>And returning to the Lord, he said: I beseech thee: this people hath sinned a heinous sin, and they have made to themselves gods of gold: either forgive them this trespass,<li>Or if thou do not, strike me out of the book that thou hast written.<li>And the Lord answered him: He that hath sinned against me, him will I strike out of my book:<li>But go thou, and lead this people whither I have told thee: my angel shall go before thee. And I in the day of revenge will visit this sin also of theirs.<li>The Lord therefore struck the people for the guilt on occasion of the calf which Aaron had made.</ol><h2><a name=33>Exodus 33</a></h2><ol><li>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: God, get thee up from this place, thou and thy people which thou has brought out of the land of Egypt, into the land concerning which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying: To thy seed I will give it.<li>And I will send an angel before thee, that I may cast out the Chanaanite, and the Amorrhite, and the Hethite, and the Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite.<li>That thou mayst enter into the land that floweth with milk and honey. For I will not go up with thee, because thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I destroy thee in the way.<li>And the people hearing these very bad tidings, mourned: and no man put on his ornaments according to custom.<li>And the Lord said to Moses: Say to the children of Israel: Thou are a stiffnecked people; once I shall come up in the midst of thee, and shall destroy thee. Now presently lay aside thy ornaments, that I may know what to do with thee.<li>So the children of Israel laid aside their ornaments by mount Horeb.<li>Moses also taking the tabernacle, pitched it without the camp afar off, and called the name thereof, The tabernacle of the covenant. And all the people that had any question, went forth to the tabernacle of the covenant, without the camp.<li>And when Moses went forth to the tabernacle, all the people rose up, and every one stood in the door of his pavilion, and they beheld the back of Moses, till he went into the tabernacle.<li>And when he was gone into the tabernacle of the covenant, the pillar of the cloud came down, and stood at the door, and he spoke with Moses.<li>And all saw that the pillar of the cloud stood at the door of the tabernacle. And they stood, and worshipped at the doors of their tents.<li>And the Lord spoke to Moses face to face, as a man is wont to speak to his friend. And when he returned into the camp, his servant Josue the son of Nun, a young man, departed not from the tabernacle.<li>And Moses said to the Lord; Thou commandest me to lead forth this people: and thou dost not let me know whom thou wilt send with me, especially whereas thou hast said: I know thee by name, and thou hast found favour in my sight.<li>If therefore I have found favour in thy sight, show me thy face, that I may know thee, and may find grace before thy eyes: look upon thy people this nation.<li>And the Lord said: My face shall go before thee, and I will give thee rest.<li>And Moses said: If thou thyself dost not go before, bring us not out of this place.<li>For how shall we be able to know, I and thy people, that we have found grace in thy sight, unless thou walk with us, that we may be glorified by all people that dwell upon the earth?<li>And the Lord said to Moses: This word also, which thou hast spoken, will I do: for thou hast found grace before me, and thee I have known by name.<li>And he said: Shew me thy glory.<li>He answered: I will shew thee all good, and I will proclaim in the name of the Lord before thee: and I will have mercy on whom I will, and I will be merciful to whom it shall please me.<li>And again he said: Thou canst not see my face: for man shall not see me and live.<li>And again he said: Behold there is a place with me, and thou shalt stand upon the rock.<li>And when my glory shall pass, I will set thee in a hole of the rock, and protect thee with my right hand, till I pass:<li>And I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face thou canst not see.</ol><h2><a name=34>Exodus 34</a></h2><ol><li>And after this he said: Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the former, and I will write upon them the words which were in the tables, which thou brokest.<li>Be ready in the morning, that thou mayst forthwith go up into mount Sinai, and thou shalt stand with me upon the top of the mount.<li>Let no man go up with thee: and let not any man be seen throughout all the mount: neither let the oxen nor the sheep feed over against it.<li>Then he cut out two tables of stone, such as had been before: and rising very early he went up into the mount Sinai, as the Lord had commanded him, carrying with him the tables.<li>And when the Lord was come down in a cloud, Moses stood with him, calling upon the name of the Lord.<li>And when he passed before him, he said: O the Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, patient and of much compassion, and true,<li>Who keepest mercy unto thousands: who takest away iniquity, and wickedness, and sin, and no man of himself is innocent before thee. Who renderest the iniquity of the fathers to the children, and to the grandchildren, unto the third and fourth generation.<li>And Moses making haste, bowed down prostrate unto the earth, and adoring,<li>Said: If I have found grace in thy sight: O Lord, I beseech thee, that thou wilt go with us, (for it is a stiffnecked people,) and take away our iniquities and sin, and possess us.<li>The Lord answered: I will make a covenant in the sight of all. I will do signs such as were never seen upon the earth, nor in any nation: that this people, in the midst of whom thou art, may see the terrible work of the Lord which I will do.<li>Observe all things which this day I command thee: I myself will drive out before thy face the Amorrhite, and the Chanaanite, and the Hethite, and the Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite.<li>Beware thou never join in friendship with the inhabitants of that land, which may be thy ruin:<li>But destroy their altars, break their statues, and cut down their groves:<li>Adore not any strange god. The Lord his name is Jealous, he is a jealous God.<li>Make no covenant with the men of those countries lest, when they have committed fornication with their gods, and have adored their idols, some one call thee to eat of the things sacrificed.<li>Neither shalt thou take of their daughters a wife for thy son, lest after they themselves have committed fornication, they make thy sons also to commit fornication with their gods.<li>Thou shalt not make to thyself any molten gods.<li>Thou shalt keep the feast of the unleavened bread. Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee in the time of the month of the new corn: for in the month of the springtime thou camest out from Egypt.<li>All of the male kind, that openeth the womb, shall be mine. Of all beasts, both of oxen and of sheep, it shall be mine.<li>The firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a sheep: but if thou wilt not give a price for it, it shall be slain. The firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem: neither shalt thou appear before me empty.<li>Six days shalt thou work, the seventh day thou shalt cease to plough, and to reap.<li>Thou shalt keep the feast of weeks with the firstfruits of the corn of thy wheat harvest, and the feast when the time of the year returneth that all things are laid in.<li>Three times in a year all thy males shall appear in the sight of the Almighty Lord the God of Israel.<li>For when I shall have taken away the nations from thy face, and shall have enlarged thy borders, no man shall lie in wait against thy land when thou shalt go up, and appear in the sight of the Lord thy God thrice in a year.<li>Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice upon leaven: neither shall there remain in the morning any thing of the victim of the solemnity of the Lord.<li>The first of the fruits of thy ground thou shalt offer in the house of the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in the milk of his dam.<li>And the Lord said to Moses: Write these words by which I have made a covenant both with thee and with Israel.<li>And he was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights: he neither ate bread nor drank water, and he wrote upon the tables the ten words of the covenant.<li>And when Moses came down from the mount Sinai, he held the two tables of the testimony, and he knew not that his face was horned from the conversation of the Lord.<li>And Aaron and the children of Israel seeing the face of Moses horned, were afraid to come near.<li>And being called by him, they returned, both Aaron and the rulers of the congregation. And after that he spoke to them.<li>And all the children of Israel came to him: and he gave them in commandment all that he had heard of the Lord in mount Sinai.<li>And having done speaking, he put a veil upon his face.<li>But when he went in to the Lord, and spoke with him, he took it away until he came forth, and then he spoke to the children of Israel all things that had been commanded him.<li>And they saw that the face of Moses when he came out was horned, but he covered his face again, if at any time he spoke to them.</ol><h2><a name=35>Exodus 35</a></h2><ol><li>And all the multitude of the children of Israel being gathered together, he said to them: These are the things which the Lord hath commanded to be done.<li>Six days you shall do work: the seventh day shall be holy unto you, the sabbath, and the rest of the Lord: he that shall do any work on it, shall be put to death.<li>You shall kindle no fire in any of your habitations on the sabbath day.<li>And Moses said to all the assembly of the children of Israel: This is the word the Lord hath commanded, saying:<li>Set aside with you firstfuits to the Lord. Let every one that is willing and hath a ready heart, offer them to the Lord: gold, and silver, and brass,<li>Violet and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, and fine linen, goats' hair,<li>And rams' skins dyed red, and violet coloured skins, setim wood,<li>And oil to maintain lights, and to make ointment, and most sweet incense.<li>Onyx stones, and precious stones, for the adorning of the ephod and the rational.<li>Whosoever of you is wise, let him come, and make that which the Lord hath commanded:<li>To wit, the tabernacle and the roof thereof, and the cover, the rings, and the board work with the oars, the pillars, and the sockets:<li>The ark and the staves, the propitiatory, and the veil that is drawn before it:<li>The table with the bars and the vessels, and the loaves of proposition:<li>The candlestick to bear up the lights, the vessels thereof and the lamps, and the oil for the nourishing of fires:<li>The altar of incense, and the bars, and the oil of unction and the incense of spices: the hanging at the door of the tabernacle:<li>The altar of holocaust, and its grate of brass, with the bars and vessels thereof: the laver and its foot:<li>The curtains of the court with the pillars and the sockets, the hanging in the doors of the entry,<li>The pins of the tabernacle and of the court with their little cords:<li>The vestments that are to be used in the ministry of the sanctuary, the vesture of Aaron the high priest, and of his sons, to do the office of priesthood to me.<li>And all the multitude of the children of Israel going out from the presence of Moses,<li>Offered firstfruits to the Lord with a most ready and devout mind, to make the work of the tabernacle of the testimony. Whatsoever was necessary to the service, and to the holy vestments,<li>Both men and women gave bracelets and earrings, rings and tablets: every vessel of gold was set aside to be offered to the Lord.<li>If any man had violet, and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, fine linen and goats' hair, rams' skins dyed red, and violet coloured skins,<li>Metal of silver and brass, they offered it to the Lord, and setim wood for divers uses.<li>The skilful women also gave such things as they had spun, violet, purple, and scarlet, and fine linen,<li>And goats' hair, giving all of their own accord.<li>But the princes offered onyx stone, and precious stones, for the ephod and the rational,<li>And spices and oil for the lights, and for the preparing of ointment, and to make the incense of most sweet savour.<li>All both men and women with devout mind offered gifts, that the works might be done which the Lord had commanded by the hand of Moses. All the children of Israel dedicated voluntary offerings to the Lord.<li>And Moses said to the children of Israel: Behold the Lord hath called by name Beseleel the son of Uri the son of Hur of the tribe of Juda.<li>And hath filled him with the spirit of God, with wisdom and understanding and knowledge and all learning.<li>To devise and to work in gold and silver and brass,<li>And in engraving stones, and in carpenters' work. Whatsoever can be devised artificially,<li>He hath given in his heart: Ooliab also the son of Achisamech of the tribe of Dan:<li>Both of them hath he instructed with wisdom, to do carpenters' work and tapestry, and embroidery in blue and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, and fine linen, and to weave all things, and to invent all new things.</ol><h2><a name=36>Exodus 36</a></h2><ol><li>Beseleel, therefore, and Ooliab, and every wise man, to whom the Lord gave wisdom and understanding, to know how to work artificially, made the things that are necessary for the uses of the sanctuary, and which the Lord commanded.<li>And when Moses had called them, and every skilful man, to whom the Lord had given wisdom, and such as of their own accord had offered themselves to the making of the work,<li>He delivered all the offerings of the children of Israel unto them. And while they were earnest about the work, the people daily in the morning offered their vows.<li>Whereupon the workmen being constrained to come,<li>Said to Moses: The people offereth more than is necessary.<li>Moses therefore commanded proclamation to be made by the crier's voice: Let neither man nor woman offer any more for the work of the sanctuary. And so they ceased from offering gifts,<li>Because the things that were offered did suffice, and were too much.<li>And all the men that were wise of heart, to accomplish the work of the tabernacle, made ten curtains of twisted fine linen, and violet, and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, with varied work, and the art of embroidering:<li>The length of one curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth four: all the curtains were of the same size.<li>And he joined five curtains, one to another, and the other five he coupled one to another.<li>He made also loops of violet in the edge of the curtain on both sides, and in the edge of the other curtain in like manner,<li>That the loops might meet on against another, and might be joined each with the other.<li>Whereupon also he cast fifty rings of gold, that might catch the loops of the curtains, and they might be made one tabernacle.<li>He made also eleven curtains of goats' hair, to cover the roof of the tabernacle:<li>One curtain was thirty cubits long and four cubits broad: all the curtains were of one measure.<li>Five of which he joined apart, and the other six apart.<li>And he made fifty loops in the edge of one curtain, and fifty in the edge of another curtain, that they might be joined one to another.<li>And fifty buckles of brass wherewith the roof might be knit together, that of all the curtains there might be made one covering.<li>He made also a cover for the tabernacle of rams' skins dyed red: and another cover over that of violet skins.<li>He made also the boards of the tabernacle of setim wood standing.<li>The length of one board was ten cubits: and the breadth was one cubit and a half.<li>There were two mortises throughout every board, that one might be joined to the other. And in this manner he made for all the boards of the tabernacle.<li>Of which twenty were at the south side southward,<li>With forty sockets of silver, two sockets were put under one board on the two sides of the corners, where the mortises of the sides end in the corners.<li>At that side also of the tabernacle, that looketh toward the north, he made twenty boards.<li>With forty sockets of silver, two sockets for every board.<li>But against the west, to wit, at that side of the tabernacle, which looketh to the sea, he made six boards,<li>And two others at each corner of the tabernacle behind:<li>Which were also joined from beneath unto the top, and went together into one joint. Thus he did on both sides at the corners:<li>So there were in all eight boards and they had sixteen sockets of silver, to wit, two sockets under every board.<li>He made also bars of setim wood, five to hold together the boards of one side of the tabernacle,<li>And five others to join together the boards of the other side: and besides these, five other bars at the west side of the tabernacle towards the sea.<li>He made also another bar, that might come by the midst of the boards from corner to corner.<li>And the board works themselves he overlaid with gold, casting for them sockets of silver. And their rings he made of gold, through which the bars might be drawn: and he covered the bars themselves with plates of gold.<li>He made also a veil of violet, and purple, scarlet, and fine twisted linen, varied and distinguished with embroidery:<li>And four pillars of setim wood, which with their heads be overlaid with gold, casting for them sockets of silver.<li>He made also a hanging in the entry of the tabernacle of violet, purple, scarlet, and fine twisted linen, with the work of an embroiderer.<li>And five pillars with their heads, which he covered with gold, and their sockets he cast of brass.</ol><h2><a name=37>Exodus 37</a></h2><ol><li>And Beseleel made also the ark of setim wood: it was two cubits and a half in length, and a cubit and a half in breadth, and the height was of one cubit and a half: and he overlaid it with the purest gold within and without.<li>And he made to it a crown of gold round about,<li>Casting four rings of gold at the four corners thereof: two rings in one side, and two in the other.<li>And he made bars of setim wood, which he overlaid with gold,<li>And he put them into the rings that were at the sides of the ark to carry it.<li>He made also the propitiatory, that is, the oracle, of the purest gold, two cubits and a half in length, and a cubit and a half in breadth.<li>Two cherubims also of beaten gold, which he set on the two sides of the propitiatory:<li>One cherub in the top of one side, and the other cherub in the top of the other side: two cherubims at the two ends of the propitiatory,<li>Spreading their wings, and covering the propitiatory, and looking one towards the other, and towards it.<li>He made also the table of setim wood, in length two cubits, and in breadth one cubit, and in height it was a cubit and a half.<li>And he overlaid it with the finest gold, and he made to it a golden ledge round about.<li>And to the ledge itself he made a polished crown of gold, of four fingers' breadth, and upon the same another golden crown.<li>And he cast four rings of gold, which he put in the four corners at each foot of the table,<li>Over against the crown: and he put the bars into them, that the table might be carried.<li>And the bars also themselves he made of setim wood, and overlaid them with gold,<li>And the vessels for the divers uses of the table, dishes, bowls, and cups, and censers of pure gold, wherein the libations are to be offered.<li>He made also the candlestick of beaten work of the finest gold. From the shaft whereof its branches, its cups, and bowls, and lilies came out:<li>Six on the two sides: three branches on one side, and three on the other.<li>Three cups in manner of a nut on each branch, and bowls withal and lilies; and three cups of the fashion of a nut in another branch, and bowls withal and lilies.
