  <h2><a name="1">Exodus 1</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>These are the names of the children of Israel, that
    went into Egypt with Jacob: they went in, every man with his
    household:</span></li>

    <li><span>Ruben, Simeon, Levi, Juda,</span></li>

    <li><span>Issachar, Zabulon, and Benjamin,</span></li>

    <li><span>Dan, and Nephtali, Gad and Aser.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the souls that came out of Jacob's thigh,
    were seventy: but Joseph was in Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>After he was dead, and all his brethren, and all that
    generation,</span></li>

    <li><span>The children of Israel increased, and sprung up into
    multitudes, and growing exceedingly strong they filled the
    land.</span></li>

    <li><span>In the mean time there arose a new king over Egypt,
    that knew not Joseph:</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to his people: Behold the people of the
    children of Israel are numerous and stronger than
    we.</span></li>

    <li><span>Come, let us wisely oppress them, lest they multiply:
    and if any war shall rise against us, join with our enemies,
    and having overcome us, depart out of the land.</span></li>

    <li><span>Therefore he set over them masters of the works, to
    afflict them with burdens, and they built for Pharao cities of
    tabernacles, Phithom and Ramesses.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the more they oppressed them, the more they were
    multiplied, and increased:</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Egyptians hated the children of Israel, and
    afflicted them and mocked them:</span></li>

    <li><span>And they made their life bitter with hard works in
    clay, and brick, and with all manner of service, wherewith they
    were overcharged in the works of the earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the king of Egypt spoke to the midwives of the
    Hebrews: of whom one was called Sephora, the other
    Phua,</span></li>

    <li><span>Commanding them: When you shall do the office of
    midwives to the Hebrew women, and the time of delivery is come:
    if it be a man child, kill it: if a woman, keep it
    alive.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the
    king of Egypt had commanded, but saved the men
    children.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the king called for them and said: What is that
    you meant to do, that you would save the men children
    ?</span></li>

    <li><span>They answered: The Hebrew women are not as the
    Egyptian women: for they themselves are skillful in the office
    of a midwife; and they are delivered before we come to
    them.</span></li>

    <li><span>Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the
    people multiplied and grew exceedingly strong.</span></li>

    <li><span>And because the midwives feared God, he built them
    houses.</span></li>

    <li><span>Pharao therefore charged all his people, saying:
    Whatsoever shall be born of the male sex, ye shall cast into
    the river: whatsoever of the female, ye shall save
    alive.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="2">Exodus 2</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>After this there went a man of the house of Levi; and
    took a wife of his own kindred.</span></li>

    <li><span>And she conceived, and bore a son; and seeing him a
    goodly child hid him three months.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when she could hide him no longer, she took a
    basket made of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and pitch:
    and put the little babe therein, and laid him in the sedges by
    the river's brink,</span></li>

    <li><span>His sister standing afar off, and taking notice what
    would be done.</span></li>

    <li><span>And behold the daughter of Pharao came down to wash
    herself in the river: and her maids walked by the river's
    brink. And when she saw the basket in the sedges, she sent one
    of her maids for it: and when it was brought,</span></li>

    <li><span>She opened it and seeing within it an infant crying,
    having compassion on it she said: This is one of the babes of
    the Hebrews.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the child's sister said to her Shall I go and
    call to thee a Hebrew woman, to nurse the babe ?</span></li>

    <li><span>She answered: Go. The maid went and called her
    mother.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Pharao's daughter said to her. Take this child
    and nurse him for me: I will give thee thy wages. The woman
    took, and nursed the child: and when he was grown up, she
    delivered him to Pharao's daughter.</span></li>

    <li><span>And she adopted him for a son, and called him Moses,
    saying: Because I took him out of the water.</span></li>

    <li><span>In those days after Moses was grown up, he went out
    to his brethren: and saw their affliction, and an Egyptian
    striking one of the Hebrews his brethren.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had looked about this way and that way,
    and saw no one there, he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the
    sand.</span></li>

    <li><span>And going out the next day, he saw two Hebrews
    quarreling: and he said to him that did the wrong: Why strikest
    thou thy neighbour?</span></li>

    <li><span>But he answered: Who hath appointed thee prince and
    judge over us: wilt thou kill me, as thou didst yesterday kill
    the Egyptian? Moses feared, and said: How is this come to be
    known ?</span></li>

    <li><span>And Pharao heard of this word and sought to kill
    Moses: but he fled from his sight, and abode in the land of
    Madian, and he sat down by a well.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the priest of Madian had seven daughters, who
    came to draw water: and when the troughs were filled, desired
    to water their father's flocks.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the shepherds came and drove them away: and Moses
    arose, and defending the maids, watered their
    sheep.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they returned to Raguel their father, he
    said to them: Why are ye come sooner than usual?</span></li>

    <li><span>They answered: A man of Egypt delivered us from the
    hands of the shepherds: and he drew water also with us, and
    gave the sheep to drink.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he said: Where is he? why have you let the man
    go? call him that he may eat bread.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses swore that he would dwell with him. And he
    took Sephora his daughter to wife:</span></li>

    <li><span>And she bore him a son, whom he called Gersam,
    saying: I have been a stranger in a foreign country. And she
    bore another, whom he called Eliezer, saying: For the God of my
    father, my helper hath delivered me out of the hand of
    Pharao.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now after a long time the king of Egypt died: and the
    children of Israel groaning, cried out because of the works:
    and their cry went up unto God from the works.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he heard their groaning, and remembered the
    covenant which he made with Abraham, Isaac, and
    Jacob.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord looked upon the children of Israel, and
    he knew them.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="3">Exodus 3</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Now Moses fed the sheep of Jethro his father in law,
    the priest of Madian: and he drove the flock to the inner parts
    of the desert, and came to the mountain of God,
    Horeb.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out
    of the midst of a bush: and he saw that the bush was on fire
    and was not burnt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses said: I will go and see this great sight,
    why the bush is not burnt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the Lord saw that he went forward to see, he
    called to him out of the midst of the bush, and said: Moses,
    Moses. And he answered: Here I am.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said: Come not nigh hither, put off the shoes
    from thy feet: for the place whereon thou standest is holy
    ground.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said: I am the God of thy father, the God of
    Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Moses hid his
    face: for he durst not look at God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to him: I have seen the affliction
    of my people in Egypt, and I have heard their cry because of
    the rigour of them that are over the works:</span></li>

    <li><span>And knowing their sorrow, I am come down to deliver
    them out of the hands of the Egyptians, and to bring them out
    of that land into a good and spacious land, into a land that
    floweth with milk and honey, to the places of the Chanaanite,
    and Hethite, and Amorrhite, and Pherezite, and Hevite, and
    Jebusite.</span></li>

    <li><span>For the cry of the children of Israel is come unto
    me: and I have seen their affliction, wherewith they are
    oppressed by the Egyptians.</span></li>

    <li><span>But come, and I will send thee to Pharao, that thou
    mayst bring forth my people, the children of Israel out of
    Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses said to God: Who am I that I should go to
    Pharao, and should bring forth the children of Israel out of
    Egypt?</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to him: I will be with thee: and this
    thou shalt have for a sign, that I have sent thee: When thou
    shalt have brought my people out of Egypt, thou shalt offer
    sacrifice to God upon this mountain.</span></li>

    <li><span>Moses said to God: Lo, I shall go to the children of
    Israel, and say to them: The God of your fathers hath sent me
    to you. If they should say to me: What is his name? what shall
    I say to them?</span></li>

    <li><span>God said to Moses: I AM WHO AM. He said: Thus shalt
    thou say to the children of Israel: HE WHO IS, hath sent me to
    you.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God said again to Moses: Thus shalt thou say to
    the children of Israel: The Lord God of your fathers, the God
    of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent
    me to you: This is my name for ever, and this is my memorial
    unto all generations.</span></li>

    <li><span>Go, gather together the ancients of Israel, and thou
    shalt say to them: The Lord God of your fathers, the God of
    Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared
    to me, saying: Visiting I have visited you: and I have seen all
    that hath befallen you in Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I have said the word to bring you forth out of
    the affliction of Egypt, into the land of the Chanaanite, the
    Hethite, and the Amorrhite, and Pherezite, and Hevite, and
    Jebusite, to a land that floweth with milk and
    honey.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they shall hear thy voice: and thou shalt go in,
    thou and the ancients of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and thou
    shalt say to him: The Lord God of the Hebrews hath called us:
    we will go three days' journey into the wilderness, to
    sacrifice unto the Lord our God.</span></li>

    <li><span>But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you
    go, but by a mighty hand.</span></li>

    <li><span>For I will stretch forth my hand and will strike
    Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst of them:
    after these he will let you go.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I will give favour to this people, in the sight
    of the Egyptians: and when you go forth, you shall not depart
    empty:</span></li>

    <li><span>But every woman shall ask of her neighbour, and of
    her that is in her house, vessels of silver and of gold, and
    raiment: and you shall put them on your sons and daughters, and
    shall spoil Egypt.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="4">Exodus 4</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Moses answered and said: They will not believe me,
    nor hear my voice, but they will say: The Lord hath not
    appeared to thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then he said to him: What is that thou holdest in thy
    hand? He answered: A rod.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said: Cast it down upon the ground. He
    cast it down, and it was turned into a serpent: so that Moses
    fled from it.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said: Put out thy hand and take it by
    the tail. He put forth his hand, and took hold of it, and it
    was turned into a rod.</span></li>

    <li><span>That they may believe, saith he, that the Lord God of
    their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the
    God of Jacob, hath appeared to thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said again: Put thy hand into thy bosom.
    And when he had put it into his bosom, he brought it forth
    leprous as snow.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said: Put back thy hand into thy bosom. He put
    it back, and brought it out again, and it was like the other
    flesh.</span></li>

    <li><span>If they will not believe thee, saith he, nor hear the
    voice of the former sign, they will believe the word of the
    latter sign.</span></li>

    <li><span>But if they will not even believe these two signs,
    nor hear thy voice: take of the river water, and pour it out
    upon the dry land, and whatsoever thou drawest out of the river
    shall be turned into blood.</span></li>

    <li><span>Moses said: I beseech thee, Lord. I am not eloquent
    from yesterday and the day before: and since thou hast spoken
    to thy servant, I have more impediment and slowness of
    tongue.</span></li>

    <li><span>The Lord said to him: Who made man's mouth? or who
    made the dumb and the deaf, the seeing and the blind? did not
    I?</span></li>

    <li><span>Go therefore and I will be in thy mouth: and I will
    teach thee what thou shalt speak.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he said: I beseech thee, Lord send whom thou wilt
    send.</span></li>

    <li><span>The Lord being angry at Moses, said Aaron the Levite
    is thy brother, I know that he is eloquent: behold he cometh
    forth to meet thee, and seeing thee shall be glad at
    heart.</span></li>

    <li><span>Speak to him, and put my words in his mouth: and I
    will be in thy mouth, and in his mouth, and will shew you what
    you must do.</span></li>

    <li><span>He shall speak in thy stead to the people, and shall
    be thy mouth: but thou shalt be to him in those things that
    pertain to God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And take this rod in thy hand, wherewith thou shalt
    do the signs.</span></li>

    <li><span>Moses went his way, and returned to Jethro his father
    in law and said to him: I will go and return to my brethren
    into Egypt, that I may see if they be yet alive. And Jethro
    said to him: Go in peace.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses, in Madian: Go, and return
    into Egypt: for they are all dead that sought thy
    life.</span></li>

    <li><span>Moses therefore took his wife, and his sons, and set
    them upon an ass: and returned into Egypt, carrying the rod of
    God in his hand.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to him as he was returning into
    Egypt: See that thou do all the wonders before Pharao, which I
    have put in thy hand: I shall harden his heart, and he will not
    let the people go.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt say to him: Thus saith the Lord:
    Israel is my son, my firstborn.</span></li>

    <li><span>I have said to thee: Let my son go, that he may serve
    me, and thou wouldst not let him go: behold I will kill thy
    son, thy firstborn.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he was in his journey, in the inn, the Lord
    met him, and would have killed him.</span></li>

    <li><span>Immediately Sephora took a very sharp stone, and
    circumcised the fore skin of her son, and touched his feet and
    said: A bloody spouse art thou to me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he let him go after she had said A bloody spouse
    art thou to me, because of the circumcision.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Aaron: Go into the desert to
    meet Moses. And he went forth to meet him in the mountain of
    God, and kissed him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord, by
    which he had sent him, and the signs that he had
    commanded.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they came together, and they assembled all the
    ancients of the children of Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had said
    to Moses: and he wrought the signs before the
    people,</span></li>

    <li><span>And the people believed. And they heard that the Lord
    had visited the children of Israel: and that he had looked upon
    their affliction: and falling down they adored.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="5">Exodus 5</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>After these things Moses and Aaron went in, and said
    to Pharao: Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: Let my people go
    that they may sacrifice to me in the desert.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he answered: Who is the Lord, that I should hear
    his voice, and let Israel go? I know not the Lord, neither will
    I let Israel go.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they said: The God of the Hebrews hath called us,
    to go three days' journey into the wilderness and to sacrifice
    to the Lord our God: lest a pestilence or the sword fall upon
    us.</span></li>

    <li><span>The king of Egypt said to them: Why do you Moses and
    Aaron draw off the people from their works? Get you gone to
    your burdens.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Pharao said: The people of the land is numerous:
    you see that the multitude is increased: how much more if you
    give them rest from their works?</span></li>

    <li><span>Therefore he commanded the same day the overseers of
    the works, and the taskmasters of the people,
    saying:</span></li>

    <li><span>You shall give straw no more to the people to make
    brick, as before: but let them go and gather straw.</span></li>

    <li><span>And you shall lay upon them the task of bricks, which
    they did before, neither shall you diminish any thing thereof:
    for they are idle, and therefore they cry, saying: Let us go
    and sacrifice to our God.</span></li>

    <li><span>Let them be oppressed, with works, and let them
    fulfill them: that they may not regard lying words.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the overseers of the works and the taskmasters
    went out and said to the people: Thus saith Pharao, I allow you
    no straw:</span></li>

    <li><span>Go, and gather it where you can find it: neither
    shall any thing of your work be diminished.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the people was scattered through all the land of
    Egypt to gather straw.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the overseers of the works pressed them, saying:
    Fulfill your work every day as before you were wont to do when
    straw was given you.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they that were over the works of the children of
    Israel were scourged by Pharao's taskmasters, saying: Why have
    you not made up the task of bricks both yesterday and to day as
    before?</span></li>

    <li><span>And the officers of the children of Israel came, and
    cried out to Pharao, saying: Why dealest thou so with thy
    servants?</span></li>

    <li><span>Straw is not given us, and bricks are required of us
    as before: behold we thy servants are beaten with whips, and
    thy people is unjustly dealt withal.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said: You are idle, and therefore you say: Let
    us go and sacrifice to the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>Go therefore, and work: straw shall not be given you,
    and you shall deliver the accustomed number of
    bricks.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the officers of the children of Israel saw that
    they were in evil case, because it was said to them: There
    shall not a whit be diminished of the bricks for every
    day.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood over against
    them as they came out from Pharao:</span></li>

    <li><span>And they said to them: The Lord see and judge,
    because you have made our savour to stink before Pharao and his
    servants, and you have given him a sword to kill
    us.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses returned to the Lord, and said: Lord, why
    hast thou afflicted this people? wherefore hast thou sent
    me?</span></li>

    <li><span>For since the time that I went in to Pharao to speak
    in thy name, he hath afflicted thy people: and thou hast not
    delivered them.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="6">Exodus 6</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Now thou shalt see what I
    will do to Pharao: for by a mighty hand shall he let them go,
    and with a strong hand shall he cast them out of his
    land.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: I am the
    Lord,</span></li>

    <li><span>That appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, by
    the name of God Almighty; and my name ADONAI I did not shew
    them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I made a covenant with them, to give them the
    land of Chanaan, the land of their pilgrimage wherein they were
    strangers.</span></li>

    <li><span>I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel,
    wherewith the Egyptians have oppressed them: and I have
    remembered my covenant.</span></li>

    <li><span>Therefore say to the children of Israel: I am the
    Lord who will bring you out from the work prison of the
    Egyptians, and will deliver you from bondage: and redeem you
    with a high arm, and great judgments.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I will take you to myself for my people, I will
    be your God: and you shall know that I am the Lord your God who
    brought you out from the work prison of the
    Egyptians.</span></li>

    <li><span>And brought you into the land, concerning which I
    lifted up my hand to give it to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and I
    will give it you to possess, I am the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses told all this to the children of Israel:
    but they did not hearken to him, for anguish of spirit, and
    most painful work.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying</span></li>

    <li><span>Go in, and speak to Pharao king of Egypt, that he let
    the children of Israel go out of his land.</span></li>

    <li><span>Moses answered before the Lord Behold the children of
    Israel do no hearken to me; and how will Pharao hear me,
    especially as I am of uncircumcised lips?</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, and he gave
    them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharao the
    king of Egypt, that they should bring forth the children of
    Israel out of the land of Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>These are the heads of their house by their families.
    The sons of Rubel the firstborn of Israel: Henoch and Phallu,
    Hesron and Charmi.</span></li>

    <li><span>These are the kindreds of Ruben. The sons of Simeon:
    Jamuel, and Jamin and Ahod, and Jachin, and Soar, and Saul the
    son of a chanaanitess: these are the families of
    Simeon.</span></li>

    <li><span>And these are the names of the sons of Levi by their
    kindreds: Gerson, and Caath, and Merari. And the years of the
    life of Levi were a hundred and thirty seven.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Gerson: Lobni and Semei, by their
    kindreds.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Caath: Amram, and Isaar, and EIebron, and
    Oziel. And the years of Caath's life were a hundred and
    thirty-three.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Merari: Moholi and Musi. These are the
    kindreds of Levi by their families.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Amram took to wife Jochabed his aunt by the
    father's side: and she bore him Aaron and Moses. And the years
    of Amram's life were a hundred and thirty-seven.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons also of Isaar: Core, and Nepheg, and
    Zechri.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons also of Oziel: Mizael, and Elizaphan, and
    Sethri.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Aaron took to wife Elizabeth the daughter of
    Aminadab, sister of Nahason, who bore him Nadab, and Abiu, and
    Eleazar, and Ithamar.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons also of Core: Aser, and Elcana, and
    Abiasaph. These are the kindreds of the Corites.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Eleazar the son of Aaron took a wife of the
    daughters of Phutiel: and she bore him Phinees. These are the
    heads of the Levitical families by their kindreds.</span></li>

    <li><span>These are Aaron and Moses, whom the Lord commanded to
    bring forth the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by
    their companies.</span></li>

    <li><span>These are they that speak to Pharao king of Egypt, in
    order to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are
    that Moses and Aaron</span></li>

    <li><span>In the day when the Lord spoke to Moses in the land
    of Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: I am the Lord:
    speak thou to Pharao king of Egypt all that I say to
    thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses said before the Lord: Lo I am of
    uncircumcised lips, how will Pharao hear me?</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="7">Exodus 7</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Behold I have appointed
    thee the God of Pharao: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy
    prophet.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt speak to him all that I command thee; and
    he shall speak to Pharao, that he let the children of Israel go
    out of his land.</span></li>

    <li><span>But I shall harden his heart, and shall multiply my
    signs and wonders in the land of Egypt,</span></li>

    <li><span>And he will not hear you: and I will lay my hand upon
    Egypt, and will bring forth my army and my people the children
    of Israel out of the land of Egypt, by very great
    judgments.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, who
    have stretched forth my hand upon Egypt, and have brought forth
    the children of Israel out of the midst of them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord had commanded: so
    did they.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron
    eighty-three, when they spoke to Pharao.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron:</span></li>

    <li><span>When Pharao shall say to you, Shew signs: thou shalt
    say to Aaron: Take thy rod, and cast it down before Pharao, and
    it shall be turned into a serpent.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharao, and did as
    the Lord had commanded. And Aaron took the rod before Pharao,
    and his servants, and it was turned into a serpent.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Pharao called the wise men and the magicians: and
    they also by Egyptian enchantments and certain secrets did in
    like manner.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they every one cast down their rods, and they
    were turned into serpents: but Aaron's rod devoured their
    rods.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Pharao's heart was hardened, and he did not
    hearken to them, as the Lord had commanded.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Pharao's heart is
    hardened, he will not let the people go.</span></li>

    <li><span>Go to him in the morning, behold he will go out to
    the waters: and thou shalt stand to meet him on the bank of the
    river: and thou shalt take in thy hand the rod that was turned
    into a serpent.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt say to him: The Lord God of the
    Hebrews sent me to thee saying: Let my people go to sacrifice
    to me in the desert: and hitherto thou wouldst not
    hear.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thus therefore saith the Lord: In this thou shalt
    know that I am the Lord: behold I will strike with the rods
    that is in my hand, the water of the river, and it shall be
    turned into blood.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the fishes that are in the river shall die, and
    the waters shall be corrupted, and the Egyptians shall be
    afflicted when they drink the water of the river.</span></li>

    <li><span>The Lord also said to Moses: Say to Aaron, Take thy
    rod, and stretch forth thy hand upon the waters of Egypt, and
    upon their rivers, and streams and pools, and all the ponds of
    waters, that they may be turned into blood: and let blood be in
    all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and of
    stone.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord had commanded:
    and lifting up the rod he struck the water of the river before
    Pharao and his servants: and it was turned into
    blood.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the fishes that were in the river died: and the
    river corrupted, and the Egyptians could not drink the water of
    the river, and there was blood in all the land of
    Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the magicians of the Egyptians with their
    enchantments did in like manner: and Pharao's heart was
    hardened, neither did he hear them, as the Lord had
    commanded.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he turned himself away and went into his house,
    neither did he set his heart to it this time also.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the Egyptians dug round about the river for
    water to drink: for they could not drink of the water of the
    river.</span></li>

    <li><span>And seven days were fully ended, after that the Lord
    struck the river.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="8">Exodus 8</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Go in to Pharao, and thou
    shalt say to him: Thus saith the Lord: Let my people go to
    sacrifice to me.</span></li>

    <li><span>But if thou wilt not let them go behold I will strike
    all thy coasts with frogs.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the river shall bring forth an abundance of
    frogs: which shall come up, and enter into thy house, and thy
    bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and in the houses of thy
    servants, and to thy people, and into thy ovens, and into the
    remains of thy meats;</span></li>

    <li><span>And the frogs shall come in to thee and to thy
    people, and to all thy servants.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Say to Aaron, Stretch
    forth thy hand upon the streams and upon the rivers and the
    pools, and bring forth frogs upon the land of
    Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Aaron stretched forth his hand upon the waters of
    Egypt, and the frogs came up, and covered the land of
    Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the magicians also by their enchantments did in
    like manner, and the brought forth frogs upon all the land of
    Egypt</span></li>

    <li><span>But Pharao called Moses and Aaron and said to them:
    Pray ye to the Lord to take away the frogs from me and from my
    people; and I will let the people go to sacrifice to the
    Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses said to Pharao: Set me a time when I shall
    pray for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, that
    the frogs may be driven away from thee and from thy house, and
    from thy servants, and from thy people: and may remain only in
    the river.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he answered: Tomorrow. But he said: I will do
    according to thy word; that thou mayst know that there is none
    like to the Lord our God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy
    house, and from thy servants, and from thy people; and shall
    remain only in the river.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses and Aaron went forth from Pharao: and Moses
    cried to the Lord for the promise, which he had made to Pharao
    concerning the frogs.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord did according to the word of Moses: and
    the frogs died out of the houses, and out of the villages, and
    out of the fields:</span></li>

    <li><span>And they gathered them together into immense heaps,
    and the land was corrupted.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Pharao seeing that rest was given, hardened his
    own heart, and did not hear them, as the Lord had
    commanded.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Say to Aaron, Stretch
    forth thy rod, and strike the dust of the earth: and may there
    be sciniphs in all the land of Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they did so. And Aaron stretched forth his hand,
    holding the rod: and he struck the dust of the earth, and there
    came sciniphs on men and on beasts: all the dust of the earth
    was turned into sciniphs through all the land of
    Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the magicians with their enchantments practiced
    in like manner, to bring forth sciniphs, and they could not and
    there were sciniphs as well on men as on beasts.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the magicians said to Pharao This is the finger
    of God. And Pharao heart was hardened, and he hearkened not
    unto them, as the Lord had commanded.</span></li>

    <li><span>The Lord also said to Moses: Arise early, and stand
    before Pharao: for he will go forth to the waters: and thou
    shalt say to him: Thus saith the Lord: Let my people go to
    sacrifice to me.</span></li>

    <li><span>But if thou wilt not let them go, behold I will send
    in upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy houses all
    kind of flies: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be filled
    with flies of divers kinds, and the whole land wherein they
    shall be.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I will make the land of Gessen wherein my people
    is, wonderful in that lay, so that flies shall not be there:
    and thou shalt know that I am the Lord in the midst of the
    earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I will put a division between my people and thy
    people: tomorrow shall this sign be.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord did so. And there came a very grievous
    swarm of flies into he houses of Pharao and of his servants,
    and into all the land of Egypt: and the land was corrupted by
    this kind of flies.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Pharao called Moses and Aaron, and said to them:
    Go, and sacrifice to your God in this land.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses said: It cannot be so: for we shall
    sacrifice the abominations of the Egyptians to the Lord our
    God: now if we kill those things which the Egyptians worship,
    in their presence, they will stone us.</span></li>

    <li><span>We will go three days' journey into the wilderness:
    and we will sacrifice to the Lord our God, as he hath commanded
    us.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Pharao said: I will let you go to sacrifice to
    the Lord your God in the wilderness: but go no farther: pray
    for me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses said: I will go out from thee, and will
    pray to the Lord: and the flies shall depart from Pharao, and
    from his servants, and from his people tomorrow: but do not
    deceive any more, in not letting the people go to sacrifice to
    the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Moses went out from Pharao, and prayed to the
    Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he did according to his word: and he took away
    the flies from Pharao, and from his servants, and from his
    people: there was not left so much as one.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Pharao's heart was hardened, so that neither this
    time would he let the people go.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="9">Exodus 9</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Go in to Pharao, and
    speak to him: Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews: Let my
    people go to sacrifice to me.</span></li>

    <li><span>But if thou refuse, and withhold them
    still:</span></li>

    <li><span>Behold my hand shall be upon thy fields: and a very
    grievous murrain upon thy horses, and asses, and camels, and
    oxen, and sheep.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord will make a wonderful difference between
    the possessions of Israel and the possessions of the Egyptians,
    that nothing at all shall die of those things that belong to
    the children of Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord appointed a time, saying: Tomorrow will
    the Lord do this thing in the land.</span></li>

    <li><span>The Lord therefore did this thing the next day: and
    all the beasts of the Egyptians died, but of the beasts of the
    children of Israel there died not one.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Pharao sent to see: and there was not any thing
    dead of that which Israel possessed. And Pharao's heart was
    hardened, and he did not let the people go.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron: Take to you
    handfuls of ashes out of the chimney, and let Moses sprinkle it
    in the air in the presence of Pharao.</span></li>

    <li><span>And be there dust upon all the land of Egypt: for
    there shall be boils and swelling blains both in men and beasts
    in the whole land of Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they took ashes out of the chimney, and stood
    before Pharao, and Moses sprinkled it in the air: and there
    came boils with swelling blains in men and beasts.</span></li>

    <li><span>Neither could the magicians stand before Moses for
    the boils that were upon them, and in all the land of
    Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord hardened Pharao's heart, and he
    hearkened not unto them, as the Lord had spoken to
    Moses.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Arise in the morning, and
    stand before Pharao, and thou shalt say to him: Thus saith the
    Lord the God of the Hebrews: Let my people go to sacrifice to
    me.</span></li>

    <li><span>For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thy
    heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people: that thou
    mayst know there is none like me in all the earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>For now I will stretch out my hand to strike thee,
    and thy people with pestilence, and thou shalt perish from the
    earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And therefore have I raised thee, that I may shew my
    power in thee, and my name may be spoken of throughout all the
    earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>Dost thou yet hold back my people: and wilt thou not
    let them go?</span></li>

    <li><span>Behold I will cause it to rain to morrow at this same
    hour, an exceeding great hail: such as hath not been in Egypt
    from the day that it was founded, until this present
    time.</span></li>

    <li><span>Send therefore now presently, and gather together thy
    cattle, and all that thou hast in the field: for men and
    beasts, and all things that shall be found abroad, and not
    gathered together out of the fields, which the hail shall fall
    upon, shall die.</span></li>

    <li><span>He that feared the word of the Lord among Pharao's
    servants, made his servants and his cattle flee into
    houses:</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Stretch forth thy hand
    towards heaven, that there may be hail in the whole land of
    Egypt, upon men, and upon beasts, and upon every herb of the
    field in the land of Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses stretched forth his rod towards heaven, and
    the Lord sent thunder and hail, and lightning running along the
    ground: and the Lord rained hail upon the land of
    Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the hail and fire mixed with it drove on
    together: and it was of so great bigness, as never before was
    seen in the whole land of Egypt since that nation was
    founded.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the hail destroyed through all the land of Egypt
    all things that were in the fields, both man and beast: and the
    hail smote every herb of the field, and it broke every tree of
    the country.</span></li>

    <li><span>Only in the land of Gessen, where the children of
    Israel were, the hail fell not.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Pharao sent and called Moses and Aaron, saying to
    them: I have sinned this time also; the Lord is just: I and my
    people are wicked.</span></li>

    <li><span>Pray ye to the Lord, that the thunderings of God and
    the hail may cease: that I may let you go, and that you may
    stay here no longer.</span></li>

    <li><span>Moses said: As soon as I am gone out of the city, I
    will stretch forth my hands to the Lord, and the thunders shall
    cease, and the hail shall be no more: that thou mayst know that
    the earth is the Lord's.</span></li>

    <li><span>But I know that neither thou, nor thy servants do yet
    fear the Lord God.</span></li>

    <li><span>The flax therefore and the barley were hurt, because
    the barley was green, and the flax was now boiled:</span></li>

    <li><span>But the wheat, and other winter corn were not hurt,
    because they were lateward.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Moses was gone from Pharao out of the city,
    he stretched forth his hands to the Lord: and the thunders and
    the hail ceased, neither did there drop any more rain upon the
    earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Pharao seeing that the rain and the hail, and the
    thunders were ceased, increased his sin.</span></li>

    <li><span>And his heart was hardened, and the heart of his
    servants, and it was made exceeding hard: neither did he let
    the children of Israel go, as the Lord had commanded by the
    hand of Moses.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="10">Exodus 10</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Go in to Pharao; for I
    have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants: that I
    may work these my signs in him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou mayest tell in the ears of thy sons, and of
    they grandsons, how often I have plagued the Egyptians, and
    wrought my signs amongst them: and you may know that I am the
    Lord:</span></li>

    <li><span>Therefore Moses and Aaron went in to Pharao, and said
    to him: Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews: How long
    refusest thou to submit to me? let my people go, to sacrifice
    to me.</span></li>

    <li><span>But if thou resist, and wilt not let them go, behold
    I will bring in to morrow the locust into thy
    coasts:</span></li>

    <li><span>To cover the face of the earth that nothing thereof
    may appear, but that which the hail hath left may be eaten: for
    they shall feed upon all the trees that spring in the
    fields.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of thy
    servants, and of all the Egyptians: such a number as thy
    fathers have not seen, nor thy grandfathers, from the time they
    were first upon the earth, until this present day. And he
    turned himself away, and went forth from Pharao.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Pharao's servants said to him: How long shall we
    endure this scandal? let the men go to sacrifice to the Lord
    their God. Dost thou not see that Egypt is undone?</span></li>

    <li><span>And they called back Moses and Aaron to Pharao: and
    he said to them: Go, sacrifice to the Lord your God: who are
    they that shall go?</span></li>

    <li><span>Moses said: We will go with our young and old, with
    our sons and daughters, with our sheep and herds: for it is the
    solemnity of the Lord our God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Pharao answered: So be the Lord with you, as I
    shall let you and your children go: who can doubt but that you
    intend some great evil?</span></li>

    <li><span>It shall not be so: but go ye men only, and sacrifice
    to the Lord: for this yourselves also desired. And immediately
    they were cast out from Pharao's presence.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Stretch forth thy hand
    upon the land of Egypt unto the locust, that it may come upon
    it, and devour every herb that is left after the
    hail.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses stretched forth his rod upon the land of
    Egypt: and the Lord brought a burning wind all that day, and
    night: and when it was morning, the burning wind raised the
    locusts:</span></li>

    <li><span>And they came up over the whole land of Egypt: and
    rested in all the coasts of the Egyptians innumerable, the like
    as had not been before that time, nor shall be
    hereafter.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they covered the whole face of the earth, wasting
    all things. And the grass of the earth was devoured, and what
    fruits soever were on the trees, which the hail had left: and
    there remained not any thing that was green on the trees, or in
    the herbs of the earth in all Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>Wherefore Pharao in haste called Moses and Aaron, and
    said to them: I have sinned against the Lord your God, and
    against you.</span></li>

    <li><span>But now forgive me my sin this time also, and pray to
    the Lord your God, that he take away from me this
    death.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses going forth from the presence of Pharao,
    prayed to the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he made a very strong wind to blow from the west,
    and it took the locusts and cast them into the Red Sea: there
    remained not so much as one in all the coasts of
    Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord hardened Pharao's heart, neither did he
    let the children of Israel go.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Stretch out they hand
    towards heaven: and may there be darkness upon the land of
    Egypt, so thick that it may be felt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses stretch forth his hand towards heaven: and
    there came horrible darkness in all the land of Egypt for three
    days.</span></li>

    <li><span>No man saw his brother, nor moved himself out of the
    place where he was: but wheresoever the children of Israel
    dwelt there was light.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Pharao called Moses and Aaron, and said to them:
    Go sacrifice to the Lord: let your sheep only, and herds
    remain; let your children go with you.</span></li>

    <li><span>Moses said: Thou shalt give us also sacrifices and
    burnt offerings, to the Lord our God.</span></li>

    <li><span>All the flocks shall go with us: there shall not a
    hoof remain of them: for they are necessary for the service of
    the Lord our God: especially as we know not what must be
    offered, till we come to the very place.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord hardened Pharao's heart, and he would
    not let them go.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Pharao said to Moses: Get thee from me, and
    beware thou see not my face any more: in what day soever thou
    shalt come in my sight, thou shalt die.</span></li>

    <li><span>Moses answered: So shall it be as thou hast spoken, I
    will not see thy face any more.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="11">Exodus 11</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Yet one plague more will
    I bring upon Pharao and Egypt, and after that he shall let you
    go and thrust you out.</span></li>

    <li><span>Therefore thou shalt tell all the people that every
    man ask of his friend, and every woman of her neighbour,
    vessels of silver, and of gold.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord will give favour to his people in the
    sight of the Egyptians. And Moses was a very great man in the
    land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharao's servants, and of all
    the people.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said: Thus said the Lord: At midnight I will
    enter into Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And every firstborn in the land of the Egyptians
    shall die, from the firstborn of Pharao who sitteth on his
    throne, even to the first born of the handmaid that is at the
    mill, and all the firstborn of beasts.</span></li>

    <li><span>And there shall be a great cry in all the land of
    Egypt, such as neither hath been before, nor shall be
    hereafter.</span></li>

    <li><span>But with all the children of Israel there shall not a
    dog make the least noise, from man even to beast: that you may
    know how wonderful a difference the Lord maketh between the
    Egyptians and Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all these thy servants shall come down to me, and
    shall worship me, saying: Go forth thou, and all the people
    that is under thee: after that we will go out.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he went out from Pharao exceeding angry. But the
    Lord said to Moses: Pharao will not hear you, that many signs
    may be done in the land of Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses and Aaron did all the wonders that are
    written, before Pharao. And the Lord hardened Pharao's heart,
    neither did he let the children of Israel go out of his
    land.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="12">Exodus 12</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron in the land of
    Egypt:</span></li>

    <li><span>This month shall be to you the beginning of months:
    it shall be the first in the months of the year.</span></li>

    <li><span>Speak ye to the whole assembly of the children of
    Israel, and say to them: On the tenth day of this month let
    every man take a lamb by their families and houses.</span></li>

    <li><span>But if the number be less than may suffice to eat the
    lamb, he shall take unto him his neighbour that joineth to his
    house, according to the number of souls which may be enough to
    eat the lamb.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it shall be a lamb without blemish, a male, of
    one year: according to which rite also you shall take a
    kid.</span></li>

    <li><span>And you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of
    this month: and the whole multitude of the children of Israel
    shall sacrifice it in the evening.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they shall take of the blood thereof, and put it
    upon both the side posts, and on the upper door posts of the
    houses, wherein they shall eat it.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they shall eat the flesh that night roasted at
    the fire, and unleavened bread with wild lettuce.</span></li>

    <li><span>You shall not eat thereof any thing raw, nor boiled
    in water, but only roasted at the fire: you shall eat the head
    with the feet and entrails thereof.</span></li>

    <li><span>Neither shall there remain any thing of it until
    morning. If there be any thing left, you shall burn it with
    fire.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thus you shall eat it: you shall gird your reins,
    and you shall have shoes on your feet, holding staves in your
    hands, and you shall eat in haste: for it is the Phase (that is
    the Passage) of the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I will pass through the land of Egypt that night,
    and will kill every firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and
    beast: and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute
    judgments: I am the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the blood shall be unto you for a sign in the
    houses where you shall be: and I shall see the blood, and shall
    pass over you: and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy
    you, when I shall strike the land of Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And this day shall be for a memorial to you: and you
    shall keep it a feast to the Lord in your generations with an
    everlasting observance.</span></li>

    <li><span>Seven days shall you eat unleavened bread: in the
    first day there shall be no leaven in your houses: whosoever
    shall eat any thing leavened, from the first day until the
    seventh day, that soul shall perish out of Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>The first day shall be holy and solemn, and the
    seventh day shall be kept with the like solemnity: you shall do
    no work in them, except those things that belong to
    eating.</span></li>

    <li><span>And you shall observe the feast of the unleavened
    bread: for in this same day I will bring forth your army out of
    the land of Egypt, and you shall keep this day in your
    generations by a perpetual observance.</span></li>

    <li><span>The first month, the fourteenth day of the month in
    the evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and
    twentieth day of the same month in the evening.</span></li>

    <li><span>Seven days there shall not be found any leaven in
    your houses: he that shall eat leavened bread, his soul shall
    perish out of the assembly of Israel, whether he be a stranger
    or born in the land.</span></li>

    <li><span>You shall not eat any thing leavened: in all your
    habitations you shall eat unleavened bread.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses called all the ancients of the children of
    Israel, and said to them: Go take a lamb by your families, and
    sacrifice the Phase.</span></li>

    <li><span>And dip a bunch of hyssop in the blood that is at the
    door, and sprinkle the transom of the door therewith, and both
    the door cheeks: let none of you go out of the door of his
    house till morning.</span></li>

    <li><span>For the Lord will pass through striking the
    Egyptians: and when he shall see the blood on the transom, and
    on both the posts, he will pass over the door of the house, and
    not suffer the destroyer to come into your houses and to hurt
    you.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt keep this thing as a law for thee and thy
    children for ever.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when you have entered into the land which the
    Lord will give you as he hath promised, you shall observe these
    ceremonies.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when your children shall say to you: What is the
    meaning of this service?</span></li>

    <li><span>You shall say to them: It is the victim of the
    passage of the Lord, when he passed over the houses of the
    children of Israel in Egypt, striking the Egyptians, and saving
    our houses. And the people bowing themselves,
    adored.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the children of Israel going forth did as the
    Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it came to pass at midnight, the Lord slew every
    firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharao,
    who sat on his throne, unto the firstborn of the captive woman
    that was in the prison, and all the firstborn of
    cattle.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Pharao arose in the night, and all his servants,
    and all Egypt: for there was not a house wherein there lay not
    one dead.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Pharao calling Moses and Aaron, in the night,
    said: Arise and go forth from among my people, you and the
    children of Israel: go, sacrifice to the Lord as you
    say.</span></li>

    <li><span>Your sheep and herds take along with you, as you
    demanded, and departing, bless me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Egyptians pressed the people to go forth out
    of the land speedily, saying: We shall all die.</span></li>

    <li><span>The people therefore took dough before it was
    leavened: and tying it in their cloaks, put it on their
    shoulders.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the children of Israel did as Moses had
    commanded: and they asked of the Egyptians vessels of silver
    and gold, and very much raiment.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord gave favour to the people in the sight
    of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them: and they
    stripped the Egyptians.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the children of Israel set forward from Ramesse
    to Socoth, being about six hundred thousand men on foot, beside
    children.</span></li>

    <li><span>And a mixed multitude without number went up also
    with them, sheep and herds and beasts of divers kinds,
    exceeding many.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they baked the meal, which a little before they
    had brought out of Egypt, in dough: and they made earth cakes
    unleavened: for it could not be leavened, the Egyptians
    pressing them to depart, and not suffering them to make any
    stay: neither did they think of preparing any meat.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the abode of the children of Israel that they
    made in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.</span></li>

    <li><span>Which being expired, the same day all the army of the
    Lord went forth out of the land of Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>This is the observable night of the Lord, when he
    brought them forth out of the land of Egypt: this night all the
    children of Israel must observe in their
    generations.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron: This is the
    service of the Phase: No foreigner shall eat of it.</span></li>

    <li><span>But every bought servant shall be circumcised, and so
    shall eat.</span></li>

    <li><span>The stranger and the hireling shall not eat
    thereof.</span></li>

    <li><span>In one house shall it be eaten, neither shall you
    carry forth of the flesh thereof out of the house, neither
    shall you break a bone thereof.</span></li>

    <li><span>All the assembly of the children of Israel shall keep
    it.</span></li>

    <li><span>And if any stranger be willing to dwell among you,
    and to keep the Phase of the Lord, all his males shall first be
    circumcised, and then shall he celebrate it according to the
    manner: and he shall be as he that is born in the land: but if
    any man be uncircumcised, he shall not eat thereof.</span></li>

    <li><span>The same law shall be to him that is born in the
    land, and to the proselyte that sojourneth with
    you.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the children of Israel did as the Lord had
    commanded Moses and Aaron.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the same day the Lord brought forth the children
    of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their
    companies.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="13">Exodus 13</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>

    <li><span>Sanctify unto me every firstborn that openeth the
    womb among the children of Israel, as well of men as of beasts:
    for they are all mine.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses said to the people: Remember this day in
    which you came forth out of Egypt, and out of the house of
    bondage, for with a strong hand hath the Lord brought you forth
    out of this place: that you eat no leavened bread.</span></li>

    <li><span>This day you go forth in the month of new
    corn.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the Lord shall have brought thee into the
    land of the Chanaanite, and the Hethite, and the Amorrhite, and
    the Hevite, and the Jebusite, which he swore to thy fathers
    that he would give thee, a land that floweth with milk and
    honey, thou shalt celebrate this manner of sacred rites in this
    month.</span></li>

    <li><span>Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread: and on
    the seventh day shall be the solemnity of the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>Unleavened bread shall you eat seven days: there
    shall not be seen any thing leavened with thee, nor in all thy
    coasts.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt tell thy son in that day, saying: This
    is what the Lord did to me when I came forth out of
    Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it shall be as a sign in thy hand, and as a
    memorial before thy eyes: and that the law of the Lord be
    always in thy mouth, for with a strong hand the Lord hath
    brought thee out of the land of Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt keep this observance at the set time from
    days to days.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the Lord shall have brought thee into the
    land of the Chanaanite, as he swore to thee and thy fathers,
    and shall give it thee:</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt set apart all that openeth the womb for
    the Lord, and all that is first brought forth of thy cattle:
    whatsoever thou shalt have of the male sex, thou shalt
    consecrate to the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>The firstborn of an ass thou shalt change for a
    sheep: and if thou do not redeem it, thou shalt kill it. And
    every firstborn of men thou shalt redeem with a
    price.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when thy son shall ask thee to morrow, saying:
    What is this? thou shalt answer him: With a strong hand did the
    Lord bring us forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house
    of bondage.</span></li>

    <li><span>For when Pharao was hardened, and would not let us
    go, the Lord slew every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from
    the firstborn of man to the firstborn of beasts: therefore I
    sacrifice to the Lord all that openeth the womb of the male
    sex, and all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it shall be as a sign in thy hand, and as a thing
    hung between thy eyes, for a remembrance: because the Lord hath
    brought us forth out of Egypt by a strong hand.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Pharao had sent out the people, the Lord led
    them not by the way of the land of the Philistines which is
    near: thinking lest perhaps they would repent, if they should
    see wars arise against them, and would return into
    Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he led them about by the way of the desert, which
    is by the Red Sea: and the children of Israel went up armed out
    of the land of Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses took Joseph's bones with him: because he
    had adjured the children of Israel, saying: God shall visit
    you, carry out my bones from hence with you.</span></li>

    <li><span>And marching from Socoth they encamped in Etham in
    the utmost coasts of the wilderness.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord went before them to shew the way by day
    in a pillar of a cloud, and by night in a pillar of fire: that
    he might be the guide of their journey at both
    times.</span></li>

    <li><span>There never failed the pillar of the cloud by day,
    nor the pillar of fire by night, before the people.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="14">Exodus 14</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>

    <li><span>Speak to the children of Israel: Let them turn and
    encamp over against Phihahiroth which is between Magdal and the
    sea over against Beelsephon: you shall encamp before it upon
    the sea.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Pharao will say of the children of Israel: They
    are straitened in the land, the desert hath shut them
    in.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I shall harden his heart, and he will pursue you:
    and I shall be glorified in Pharao, and in all his army: and
    the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord. And they did
    so.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it was told the king of the Egyptians that the
    people was fled: and the heart of Pharao and of his servants
    was changed with regard to the people, and they said: What
    meant we to do, that we let Israel go from serving
    us?</span></li>

    <li><span>So he made ready his chariot, and took all his people
    with him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the
    chariots that were in Egypt: and the captains of the whole
    army.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharao king of
    Egypt, and he pursued the children of Israel: but they were
    gone forth in a mighty hand.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the Egyptians followed the steps of them who
    were gone before, they found them encamped at the sea side: all
    Pharao's horse and chariots, and the whole army were in
    Phihahiroth before Beelsephon.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Pharao drew near, the children of Israel,
    lifting up their eyes, saw the Egyptians behind them: and they
    feared exceedingly, and cried to the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they said to Moses: Perhaps there were no graves
    in Egypt, therefore thou hast brought us to die in the
    wilderness: why wouldst thou do this, to lead us out of
    Egypt?</span></li>

    <li><span>Is not this the word that we spoke to thee in Egypt,
    saying: Depart from us that we may serve the Egyptians? for it
    was much better to serve them, than to die in the
    wilderness.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses said to the people: Fear not: stand and see
    the great wonders of the Lord, which he will do this day: for
    the Egyptians, whom you see now, you shall see no more for
    ever.</span></li>

    <li><span>The Lord will fight for you, and you shall hold your
    peace.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Why criest thou to me?
    Speak to the children of Israel to go forward.</span></li>

    <li><span>But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch forth thy hand
    over the sea, and divide it: that the children of Israel may go
    through the midst of the sea on dry ground.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I will harden the heart of the Egyptians to
    pursue you: and I will be glorified in Pharao, and in all his
    host, and in his chariots, and in his horsemen.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when
    I shall be glorified in Pharao, and in his chariots and in his
    horsemen.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the angel of God, who went before the camp of
    Israel, removing, went behind them: and together with him the
    pillar of the cloud, leaving the forepart,</span></li>

    <li><span>Stood behind, between the Egyptians' camp and the
    camp of Israel: and it was a dark cloud, and enlightening the
    night, so that they could not come at one another all the
    night.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Moses had stretched forth his hand over the
    sea, the Lord took it away by a strong and burning wind blowing
    all the night, and turned it into dry ground: and the water was
    divided.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the children of Israel went in through the midst
    of the sea dried up: for the water was as a wall on their right
    hand and on their left.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Egyptians pursuing went in after them, and
    all Pharao's horses, his chariots and horsemen through the
    midst of the sea,</span></li>

    <li><span>And now the morning watch was come, and behold the
    Lord looking upon the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire
    and of the cloud, slew their host.</span></li>

    <li><span>And overthrew the wheels of the chariots, and they
    were carried into the deep. And the Egyptians said: Let us flee
    from Israel: for the Lord fighteth for them against
    us.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Stretch forth they hand
    over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the
    Egyptians, upon their chariots and horsemen.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Moses had stretched forth his hand towards
    the sea, it returned at the first break of day to the former
    place: and as the Egyptians were fleeing away, the waters came
    upon them, and the Lord shut them up in the middle of the
    waves.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the waters returned, and covered the chariots and
    the horsemen of all the army of Pharao, who had come into the
    sea after them, neither did there so much as one of them
    remain.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the children of Israel marched through the midst
    of the sea upon dry land, and the waters were to them as a wall
    on the right hand and on the left:</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord delivered Israel on that day out of the
    hands of the Egyptians.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore,
    and the mighty hand that the Lord had used against them: and
    the people feared the Lord, and they believed the Lord, and
    Moses his servant.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="15">Exodus 15</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Then Moses and the children of Israel sung this
    canticle to the Lord: and said: Let us sing to the Lord: for he
    is gloriously magnified, the horse and the rider he hath thrown
    into the sea.</span></li>

    <li><span>The Lord is my strength and my praise, and he is
    become salvation to me: he is my God and I will glorify him:
    the God of my father, and I will exalt him.</span></li>

    <li><span>The Lord is as a man of war, Almighty is his
    name.</span></li>

    <li><span>Pharao's chariots and his army he hath cast into the
    sea: his chosen captains are drowned in the Red
    Sea.</span></li>

    <li><span>The depths have covered them, they are sunk to the
    bottom like a stone.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thy right hand, O Lord, is magnified in strength: thy
    right hand, O Lord, hath slain the enemy.</span></li>

    <li><span>And in the multitude of they glory thou hast put down
    thy adversaries: thou hast sent thy wrath, which hath devoured
    them like stubble.</span></li>

    <li><span>And with the blast of thy anger the waters were
    gathered together: the flowing water stood, the depth were
    gathered together in the midst of the sea.</span></li>

    <li><span>The enemy said: I will pursue and overtake, I will
    divide the spoils, my soul shall have its fill: I will draw my
    sword, my hand shall slay them.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thy wind blew and the sea covered them: they sunk as
    lead in the mighty waters.</span></li>

    <li><span>Who is like to thee, among the strong, O Lord? who is
    like to thee, glorious in holiness, terrible and praiseworthy,
    doing wonders?</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou stretchedst forth thy hand, and the earth
    swallowed them.</span></li>

    <li><span>In thy mercy thou hast been a leader to the people
    which thou hast redeemed: and in thy strength thou hast carried
    them to thy holy habitation.</span></li>

    <li><span>Nations rose up, and were angry: sorrows took hold on
    the inhabitants of Philisthiim.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then were the princes of Edom troubled, trembling
    seized on the stout men of Moab: all the inhabitants of Chanaan
    became stiff.</span></li>

    <li><span>Let fear and dread fall upon them, in the greatness
    of thy arm: let them become unmoveable as a stone, until thy
    people, O Lord, pass by: until this thy people pass by, which
    thou hast possessed.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the
    mountain of thy inheritance, in thy most firm habitation which
    thou hast made, O Lord; thy sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands
    have established.</span></li>

    <li><span>The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.</span></li>

    <li><span>For Pharao went in on horseback with his chariots and
    horsemen into the sea: and the Lord brought back upon them the
    waters of the sea: but the children of Israel walked on dry
    ground in the midst thereof.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Mary the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a
    timbrel in her hand: and all the women went forth after her
    with timbrels and with dances:</span></li>

    <li><span>And she began the song to them, saying: Let us sing
    to the Lord, for he is gloriously magnified, the horse and his
    rider he hath thrown into the sea.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea, and they
    went forth into the wilderness of Sur: and they marched three
    days through the wilderness, and found no water.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they came into Mara, and they could not drink the
    waters of Mara, because they were bitter: whereupon he gave a
    name also agreeable to the place, calling it Mara, that is,
    bitterness.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the people murmured against Moses, saying: What
    shall we drink?</span></li>

    <li><span>But he cried to the Lord, and he shewed him a tree,
    which when he had cast into the waters, they were turned into
    sweetness. There he appointed him ordinances, and judgments,
    and there he proved him,</span></li>

    <li><span>Saying: If thou wilt hear the voice of the Lord thy
    God, and do what is right before him, and obey his
    commandments, and keep all his precepts, none of the evils that
    I laid upon Egypt, will I bring upon thee: for I am the Lord
    thy healer.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the children of Israel came into Elim, where
    there were twelve fountains of water, and seventy palm trees:
    and they encamped by the waters.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="16">Exodus 16</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And they set forward from Elim, and all the multitude
    of the children of Israel came into the desert of Sin, which is
    between Elim and Sinai: the fifteenth day of the second month,
    after they came out of the land of Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the congregation of the children of Israel
    murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the children of Israel said to them: Would to God
    we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when
    we sat over the flesh pots, and ate bread to the full. Why have
    you brought us into this desert, that you might destroy all the
    multitude with famine?</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Behold I will rain bread
    from heaven for you: let the people go forth, and gather what
    is sufficient for every day: that I may prove them whether they
    will walk in my law, or not.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the sixth day let them provide for to bring in:
    and let it be double to that they were wont to gather every
    day.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses and Aaron said to the children of Israel:
    In the evening you shall know that the Lord hath brought you
    forth out of the land of Egypt:</span></li>

    <li><span>And in the morning you shall see the glory of the
    Lord: for he hath heard your murmuring against the Lord: but as
    for us, what are we, that you mutter against us?</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses said: In the evening the Lord will give you
    flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full: for he hath
    heard your murmurings, with which you have murmured against
    him, for what are we? your murmuring is not against us, but
    against the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>Moses also said to Aaron: Say to the whole
    congregation of the children of Israel: Come before the Lord:
    for he hath heard your murmuring.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Aaron spoke to all the assembly of the
    children of Israel, they looked towards the wilderness: and
    behold the glory of the Lord appeared in a cloud.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>

    <li><span>I have heard the murmuring of the children of Israel:
    say to them: In the evening you shall eat flesh, and in the
    morning you shall have your fill of bread: and you shall know
    that I am the Lord your God.</span></li>

    <li><span>So it came to pass in the evening, that quails coming
    up, covered the camp: and in the morning, a dew lay round about
    the camp.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when it had covered the face of the earth, it
    appeared in the wilderness small, and as it were beaten with a
    pestle, like unto the hoar frost on the ground.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one
    to another: Manhu! which signifieth: What is this! for they
    knew not what it was. And Moses said to them: This is the
    bread, which the Lord hath given you to eat.</span></li>

    <li><span>This is the word, that the Lord hath commanded: Let
    every one gather of it as much as is enough to eat: a gomor for
    every man, according to the number of your souls that dwell in
    a tent, so shall you take of it.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the children of Israel did so: and they gathered,
    one more, another less.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they measured by the measure of a gomor: neither
    had he more that had gathered more: nor did he find less that
    had provided less: but every one had gathered, according to
    what they were able to eat.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses said to them: Let no man leave thereof till
    the morning.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they hearkened not to him, but some of them left
    until the morning, and it began to be full of worms, an it
    putrefied, and Moses was angry with them.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now every one of them gathered in the morning, as
    much as might suffice to eat: and after the sun grew hot, it
    melted.</span></li>

    <li><span>But on the sixth day they gathered twice as much,
    that is, two gomors every man: and all the rulers of the
    multitude came, and told Moses.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to them: This is what the Lord hath
    spoken: To morrow is the rest of the sabbath sanctified to the
    Lord. Whatsoever work is to be done, do it: and the meats that
    are to be dressed, dress them: and whatsoever shall remain, lay
    it up until the morning.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they did so as Moses had commanded, and it did
    not putrefy, neither was there worm found in it.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses said: Eat it to day, because it is the
    sabbath of the Lord: to day it shall not be found in the
    field.</span></li>

    <li><span>Gather it six days: but on the seventh day is the
    sabbath of the Lord, therefore it shall not be
    found.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the seventh day came: and some of the people
    going forth to gather, found none.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: How long will you refuse
    to keep my commandments, and my law?</span></li>

    <li><span>See that the Lord hath given you the sabbath, and for
    this reason on the sixth day he giveth you a double provision:
    let each man stay at home, and let none go forth out of his
    place the seventh day.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the people kept the sabbath on the seventh
    day.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the house of Israel called the name thereof
    Manna: and it was like coriander seed white, and the taste
    thereof like to flour with honey.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses said: This is the word, which the Lord hath
    commanded: Fill a gomor of it, and let it be kept unto
    generations to come hereafter, that they may know the bread,
    wherewith I fed you in the wilderness, when you were brought
    forth out of the land of Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses said to Aaron: Take a vessel, and put manna
    into it, as much as a gomor can hold: and lay it up before the
    Lord to keep unto your generations,</span></li>

    <li><span>As the Lord commanded Moses. And Aaron put it in the
    tabernacle to be kept.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the children of Israel ate manna forty years,
    till they came to a habitable land: with this meat were they
    fed, until they reached the borders of the land of
    Chanaan.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now a gomor is the tenth part of an ephi.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="17">Exodus 17</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Then all the multitude of the children of Israel
    setting forward from the desert of Sin, by their mansions,
    according to the word of the Lord, encamped in Raphidim, where
    there was no water for the people to drink.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they chode with Moses, and said: Give us water,
    that we may drink. And Moses answered them: Why chide you with
    me? Wherefore do you tempt the Lord?</span></li>

    <li><span>So the people were thirsty there for want of water,
    and murmured against Moses, saying: Why didst thou make us go
    forth out of Egypt, to kill us and our children, and our beasts
    with thirst?</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses cried to the Lord, saying: What shall I do
    to this people? Yet a little more and they will stone
    me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: God before the people,
    and take with thee of the ancients of Israel: and take in thy
    hand the rod wherewith thou didst strike the river, and
    go.</span></li>

    <li><span>Behold I will stand there before thee, upon the rock
    Horeb: and thou shalt strike the rock, and water shall come out
    of it that the people may drink. Moses did so before the
    ancients of Israel:</span></li>

    <li><span>And he called the name of that place Temptation,
    because the chiding of the children of Israel, and for that
    they tempted the Lord, saying: Is the Lord amongst us or
    not?</span></li>

    <li><span>And Amalec came, and fought against Israel in
    Raphidim.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses said to Josue: Choose out men: and go out
    and fight against Amalec: to morrow I will stand on the top of
    the hill having the rod of God in my hand.</span></li>

    <li><span>Josue did as Moses had spoken, and he fought against
    Amalec; but Moses, and Aaron, and Hur went up upon the top of
    the hill.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Moses lifted up his hands, Israel overcame:
    but if he let them down a little, Amalec overcame.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses' hands were heavy: so they took a stone,
    and put under him, and he sat on it: and Aaron and Hur stayed
    up his hands on both sides. And it came to pass that his hands
    were not weary until sunset.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Josue put Amalec and his people to flight, by the
    edge of the sword.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Write this for a memorial
    in a book, and deliver it to the ears of Josue: for I will
    destroy the memory of Amalec from under heaven.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses built an altar: and called the name
    thereof, The Lord my exaltation, saying:</span></li>

    <li><span>Because the hand of the throne of the Lord, and the
    war of the Lord shall be against Amalec, from generation to
    generation.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="18">Exodus 18</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And when Jethro the priest of Madian, the kinsman of
    Moses, had heard all the things that God had done to Moses, and
    to Israel his people, and that the Lord had brought forth
    Israel out of Egypt,</span></li>

    <li><span>He took Sephora the wife of Moses whom he had sent
    back:</span></li>

    <li><span>And her two sons, of whom one was called Gersam, his
    father saying: I have been a stranger in a foreign
    country.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the other Eliezer: For the God of my father, said
    he, is my helper, and hath delivered me from the sword of
    Pharao.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jethro the kinsman of Moses came with his sons
    and his wife, to Moses into the desert, where he was camped by
    the mountain of God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he sent word to Moses, saying: I Jethro thy
    kinsman come to thee, and thy wife, and thy two sons with
    her.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he went out to meet his kinsman, and worshipped
    and kissed him: and they saluted one another with words of
    peace. And when he was come into the tent,</span></li>

    <li><span>Moses told his kinsman all that the Lord had done to
    Pharao, and the Egyptians, in favour of Israel: and all the
    labour which had befallen them in the journey, and that the
    Lord had delivered them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Jethro rejoiced for all the good things that the
    Lord had done to Israel, because he had delivered them out of
    the hands of the Egyptians.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said: Blessed is the Lord, who hath delivered
    you out of the hand of Pharao, and out of the hand of the
    Egyptians, who hath delivered his people out of the hand of
    Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now I know that the Lord is great above all gods:
    because they dealt proudly against them.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Jethro the kinsman of Moses offered holocausts and
    sacrifices to God: and Aaron and all the ancients of Israel
    came, to eat bread with them before God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the next day Moses sat, to judge the people, who
    stood by Moses from morning until night.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when his kinsman had seen all things that he did
    among the people, he said: What is it that thou dost among the
    people? Why sittest thou alone, and all the people wait from
    morning till night.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses answered him: The people come to me to seek
    the judgment of God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when any controversy falleth out among them, they
    come to me to judge between them, and to shew the precepts of
    God, and his laws.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he said: The thing thou dost is not
    good.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou are spent with foolish labour, both thou and
    this people that is with thee: the business is above thy
    strength, thou alone canst not bear it.</span></li>

    <li><span>But hear my words and counsels, and God shall be with
    thee. Be thou to the people in those things that pertain to
    God, to bring their words to him:</span></li>

    <li><span>And to shew the people the ceremonies and the manner
    of worshipping, and the way wherein they ought to walk, and the
    work that they ought to do.</span></li>

    <li><span>And provide out of all the people able men, such as
    fear God, in whom there is truth, and that hate avarice, and
    appoint of them rulers of thousands, and of hundreds, and of
    fifties, and of tens.</span></li>

    <li><span>Who may judge the people at all times: and when any
    great matter soever shall fall out, let them refer it to thee,
    and let them judge the lesser matters only: that so it may be
    lighter for thee, the burden being shared out unto
    others.</span></li>

    <li><span>If thou dost this, thou shalt fulfil the commandment
    of God, and shalt be able to bear his precepts: and all this
    people shall return to their places with peace.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Moses heard this, he did all things that he
    had suggested unto him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And choosing able men out of all Israel, he appointed
    them rulers of the people, rulers over thousands, and over
    hundreds, and over fifties, and over tens.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they judged the people at all times: and
    whatsoever was of greater difficulty they referred to him, and
    they judged the easier cases only.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he let his kinsman depart: and he returned and
    went into his own country.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="19">Exodus 19</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>In the third month of the departure of Israel out of
    the land of Egypt, on this day they came into the wilderness of
    Sinai:</span></li>

    <li><span>For departing out of Raphidim, and coming to the
    desert of Sinai, they camped in the same place, and there
    Israel pitched their tents over against the
    mountain.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses went up to God: and the Lord called unto
    him from the mountain, and said: Thus shalt thou say to the
    house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:</span></li>

    <li><span>You have seen what I have done to the Egyptians, how
    I have carried you upon the wings of eagles, and have taken you
    to myself.</span></li>

    <li><span>If therefore you will hear my voice, and keep my
    covenant, you shall be my peculiar possession above all people:
    for all the earth is mine.</span></li>

    <li><span>And you shall be to me a priestly kingdom, and a holy
    nation. Those are the words thou shalt speak to the children of
    Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>Moses came, and calling together the elders of the
    people, he declared all the words which the Lord had
    commanded.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the people answered together: All that the
    Lord hath spoken, we will do. And when Moses had related the
    people's words to the Lord,</span></li>

    <li><span>The Lord said to him: Lo, now will I come to thee in
    the darkness of a cloud, that the people may hear me speaking
    to thee, and may believe thee for ever. And Moses told the
    words of the people to the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to him: Go to the people, and sanctify
    them to day, and to morrow, and let them wash their
    garments.</span></li>

    <li><span>And let them be ready against the third day: for on
    the third day the Lord will come down in the sight of all the
    people upon mount Sinai.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt appoint certain limits to the people
    round about, and thou shalt say to them: Take heed you go not
    up into the mount, and that ye touch not the borders thereof:
    every one that toucheth the mount dying he shall
    die.</span></li>

    <li><span>No hands shall touch him, but he shall be stoned to
    death, or shall be shot through with arrows: whether it be
    beast, or man, he shall not live. When the trumpet shall begin
    to sound, then let them go up into the mount.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses came down from the mount to the people, and
    sanctified them. And when they had washed their
    garments,</span></li>

    <li><span>He said to them: Be ready against the third day, and
    come not near your wives.</span></li>

    <li><span>And now the third day was come, and the morning
    appeared: and behold thunders began to be heard, and lightning
    to flash, and a very thick cloud to cover the mount, and the
    noise of the trumpet sounded exceeding loud, and the people
    that was in the camp, feared.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Moses had brought them forth to meet God
    from the place of the camp, they stood at the bottom of the
    mount.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all mount Sinai was on a smoke: because the Lord
    was come down upon it in fire, and the smoke arose from it as
    out of a furnace: and all the mount was terrible.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the sound of the trumpet grew by degrees louder
    and louder, and was drawn out to a greater length: Moses spoke,
    and God answered him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord came down upon mount Sinai, in the very
    top of the mount, and he called Moses unto the top thereof. And
    when he was gone up thither,</span></li>

    <li><span>He said unto him: Go down, and charge the people:
    lest they should have a mind to pass the limits to see the
    Lord, and a very great multitude of them should
    perish.</span></li>

    <li><span>The priests also that come to the Lord, let them be
    sanctified, lest he strike them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses said to the Lord: The people cannot come up
    to mount Sinai: for thou did charge, and command, saying: Set
    limits about the mount, and sanctify it.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to him: Go, get thee down: and thou
    shalt come up, thou and Aaron with thee: but let not the
    priests and the people pass the limits, nor come up to the
    Lord, lest he kill them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses went down to the people and told them
    all.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="20">Exodus 20</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And the Lord spoke all these words:</span></li>

    <li><span>I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the
    land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt not have strange gods before
    me.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt not make to thyself a graven thing, nor
    the likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the
    earth beneath, nor of those things that are in the waters under
    the earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt not adore them, nor serve them: I am the
    Lord thy God, mighty, jealous, visiting the iniquity of the
    fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation
    of them that hate me:</span></li>

    <li><span>And shewing mercy unto thousands to them that love
    me, and keep my commandments.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in
    vain: for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that shall take
    the name of the Lord his God in vain.</span></li>

    <li><span>Remember that thou keep holy the sabbath
    day.</span></li>

    <li><span>Six days shalt thou labour, and shalt do all thy
    works.</span></li>

    <li><span>But on the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy
    God: thou shalt do no work on it, thou nor thy son, nor thy
    daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy
    beast, nor the stranger that is within thy gates.</span></li>

    <li><span>For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and
    the sea, and all things that are in them, and rested on the
    seventh day: therefore the Lord blessed the seventh day, and
    sanctified it.</span></li>

    <li><span>Honour thy father and thy mother, that thou mayest be
    longlived upon the land which the Lord thy God will give
    thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt not kill.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt not commit adultery.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt not steal.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy
    neighbour.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house: neither
    shalt thou desire his wife, nor his servant, nor his handmaid,
    nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is his.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the people saw the voices and the flames, and
    the sound of the trumpet, and the mount smoking: and being
    terrified and struck with fear, they stood afar
    off,</span></li>

    <li><span>Saying to Moses: Speak thou to us, and we will hear:
    let not the Lord speak to us, lest we die.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses said to the people: Fear not: for God is
    come to prove you, and that the dread of him might be in you,
    and you should not sin.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the people stood afar off. But Moses went to the
    dark cloud wherein God was.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Thus shalt thou say to
    the children of Israel: You have seen that I have spoken to you
    from heaven.</span></li>

    <li><span>You shall not make gods of silver, nor shall you make
    to yourselves gods of gold.</span></li>

    <li><span>You shall make an altar of earth unto me, and you
    shall offer upon it your holocausts and peace offerings, your
    sheep and oxen, in every place where the memory of my name
    shall be: I will come to thee, and will bless thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>And if thou make an altar of stone unto me, thou
    shalt not build it of hewn stones: for if thou lift up a tool
    upon it, it shall be defiled.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt not go up by steps unto my altar, lest thy
    nakedness be discovered.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="21">Exodus 21</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>These are the judgments which thou shalt set before
    them.</span></li>

    <li><span>If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years shall he
    serve thee: in the seventh he shall go out free for
    nothing.</span></li>

    <li><span>With what raiment he came in, with the like let him
    go out: if having a wife, his wife also shall go out with
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>But if his master gave him a wife, and she hath borne
    sons and daughters: the woman and her children shall be her
    master's: but he himself shall go out with his
    raiment.</span></li>

    <li><span>And if the servant shall say: I love my master and my

    <li><span>His master shall bring him to the gods, and he shall
    be set to the door and the posts, and he shall bore his ear
    through with an awl: and he shall be his servant for
    ever.</span></li>

    <li><span>If any man sell his daughter to be a servant, she
    shall not go out as bondwomen are wont to go out.</span></li>

    <li><span>If she displease the eyes of her master to whom she
    was delivered, he shall let her go: but he shall have no power
    to sell her to a foreign nation, if he despise her.</span></li>

    <li><span>But if he have betrothed her to his son, he shall
    deal with her after the manner of daughters.</span></li>

    <li><span>And if he take another wife for him, he shall provide
    her a marriage, and raiment, neither shall he refuse the price
    of her chastity.</span></li>

    <li><span>If he do not these three things, she shall go out
    free without money.</span></li>

    <li><span>He that striketh a man with a will to kill him, shall
    be put to death.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he that did not lie in wait for him, but God
    delivered him into his hands: I will appoint thee a place to
    which he must flee.</span></li>

    <li><span>If a man kill his neighbour on set purpose and by
    lying in wait for him: thou shalt take him away from my altar,
    that he may die.</span></li>

    <li><span>He that striketh his father or mother, shall be put
    to death.</span></li>

    <li><span>He that shall steal a man, and sell him, being

    <li><span>He that curseth his father, or mother, shall die the
    death.</span></li>

    <li><span>If men quarrel, and the one strike his neighbour with
    a stone or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his
    bed:</span></li>

    <li><span>If he rise again and walk abroad upon his staff, he
    that struck him shall be quit, yet so that he make restitution
    for his work, and for his expenses upon the
    physicians.</span></li>

    <li><span>He that striketh his bondman or bondwoman with a rod,
    and they die under his hands, shall be guilty of the
    crime.</span></li>

    <li><span>But if the party remain alive a day or two, he shall
    not be subject to the punishment, because it is his
    money.</span></li>

    <li><span>If men quarrel, and one strike a woman with child,
    and she miscarry indeed, but live herself: he shall be
    answerable for so much damage as the woman's husband shall
    require, and as arbiters shall award.</span></li>

    <li><span>But if her death ensue thereupon, he shall render
    life for life.</span></li>

    <li><span>Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for
    foot,</span></li>

    <li><span>Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for
    stripe.</span></li>

    <li><span>If any man strike the eye of his manservant or
    maidservant, and leave them but one eye, he shall let them go
    free for the eye which he put out.</span></li>

    <li><span>Also if he strike out a tooth of his manservant or
    maidservant, he shall in like manner make them
    free.</span></li>

    <li><span>If an ox gore a man or a woman, and they die, he
    shall be stoned: and his flesh shall not be eaten, but the
    owner of the ox shall be quit.</span></li>

    <li><span>But if the ox was wont to push with his horn
    yesterday and the day before, and they warned his master, and
    he did not shut him up, and he shall kill a man or a woman:
    then the ox shall be stoned, an his owner also shall be put to
    death.</span></li>

    <li><span>And if they set a price upon him, he shall give for
    his life whatsoever is laid upon him.</span></li>

    <li><span>If he have gored a son, or a daughter, he shall fall
    under the like sentence.</span></li>

    <li><span>If he assault a bondman or a bond woman, he shall
    give thirty sicles of silver to their master, and the ox shall
    be stoned.</span></li>

    <li><span>If a man open a pit, and dig one, and cover it not,
    and an ox or an ass fall into it,</span></li>

    <li><span>The owner of the pit shall pay the price of the
    beasts: and that which is dead shall be his own.</span></li>

    <li><span>If one man's ox gore another man's ox, and he die:
    they shall sell the live ox, and shall divide the price, and
    the carcass of that which died they shall part between
    them:</span></li>

    <li><span>But if he knew that his ox was wont to push yesterday
    and the day before, and his master did not keep him in: he
    shall pay ox for ox, and shall take the whole
    carcass.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt not follow the multitude to do evil:
    neither shalt thou yield in judgment, to the opinion of the
    most part, to stray from the truth.</span></li>

    <li><span>Neither shalt thou favour a poor man in
    judgment.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt not go aside in the poor man's
    judgment.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt fly lying. The innocent and just person
    thou shalt not put to death: because I abhor the

    <li><span>Neither shalt thou take bribes, which even blind the
    wise, and pervert the words of the just.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt not molest a stranger, for you know the
    hearts of strangers: for you also were strangers in the land of
    Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>Six years thou shalt sow thy ground, and shalt gather
    the corn thereof.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the seventh year thou shalt let it alone, and
    suffer it to rest, that the poor of thy people may eat, and
    whatsoever shall be left, let the beasts of the field eat it:
    so shalt thou do with thy vineyard and thy
    oliveyard.</span></li>

    <li><span>Six days thou shalt work: the seventh day thou shalt
    cease, that thy ox and thy ass may rest: and the son of thy

    <li><span>Keep all things that I have said to you. And by the

    heard out of your mouth.</span></li>

    <li><span>Three times every year you shall celebrate feasts to
    me.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread. Seven
    days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in
    the time of the month of new corn, when thou didst come forth
    out of Egypt: thou shalt not appear empty before
    me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the feast of the harvest of the firstfruits of

    <li><span>Thrice a year shall all thy males appear before the

    leaven, neither shall the fat of my solemnity remain until the

    <li><span>Behold I will send my angel, who shall go before
    thee, and keep thee in thy journey, and bring thee into the
    place that I have prepared.</span></li>

    <li><span>Take notice of him, and hear his voice, and do not

    and the Chanaanite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite, whom I
    will destroy.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt not adore their gods, nor serve them. Thou
    shalt not do their works, but shalt destroy them, and break
    their statues.</span></li>

    <li><span>And you shall serve the Lord your God, that I may
    bless your bread and your waters, and may take away sickness
    from the midst of thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>There shall not be one fruitless nor barren in thy
    land: I will fill the number of thy days.</span></li>

    <li><span>I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all
    the people to whom thou shalt come: and will turn the backs of
    all thy enemies before thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>Sending out hornets before, that shall drive away the
    Hevite, and the Chanaanite, and the Hethite, before thou come
    in.</span></li>

    <li><span>I will not cast them out from thy face in one year:
    lest the land be brought into a wilderness, and the beasts
    multiply against thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>By little and little I will drive them out from
    before thee, till thou be increased, and dost possess the
    land.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I will set thy bounds from the Red Sea to the sea
    of the Palestines, and from the desert to the river: I will
    deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hands, and will
    drive them out from before you.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt not enter into league with them, nor with
    their gods.</span></li>

    <li><span>Let them not dwell in thy land, lest perhaps thy make
    thee sin against me, if thou serve their god: which undoubtedly
    will be a scandal to thee.</span></li>

  <h2><a name="24">Exodus 24</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And he said to Moses: Come up to the Lord, thou, and
    Aaron, Nadab, and Abiu, and seventy of the ancients of Israel,
    and you shall adore afar off.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses alone shall come up to the Lord, but they
    shall not come nigh; neither shall the people come up with
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Moses came and told the people all the words of
    the Lord, and all the judgments: and all the people answered
    with one voice: We will do all the words of the Lord, which he
    hath spoken.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses wrote all the words of the Lord: and rising
    in the morning he built an altar at the foot of the mount, and
    twelve titles according to the twelve tribes of
    Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he sent young men of the children of Israel, and
    they offered holocausts, and sacrificed pacific victims of
    calves to the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Moses took half of the blood, and put it into
    bowls: and the rest he poured upon the altar.</span></li>

    <li><span>And taking the book of the covenant, he read it in
    the hearing of the people: and they said: All things that the
    Lord hath spoken we will do, we will be obedient.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he took the blood and sprinkled it upon the
    people, and he said: This is the blood of the covenant which
    the Lord hath made with you concerning all these
    words.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abiu, and seventy of
    the ancients of Israel went up:</span></li>

    <li><span>And they saw the God of Israel: and under his feet as
    it were a work of sapphire stone, and as the heaven, when
    clear.</span></li>

    <li><span>Neither did he lay his hand upon those of the
    children of Israel, that retired afar off, and they saw God,
    and they did eat and drink.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Come up to me into the
    mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and
    the law, and the commandments which I have written: that thou
    mayst teach them.</span></li>

    <li><span>Moses rose up, and his minister Josue: and Moses
    going up into the mount of God,</span></li>

    <li><span>Said to the ancients: Wait ye here till we return to
    you. You have Aaron and Hur with you: if any question shall
    arise, you shall refer it to them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Moses was gone up, a cloud covered the
    mount.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the glory of the Lord dwelt upon Sinai, covering
    it with a cloud six days: and the seventh day he called him out
    of the midst of the cloud.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the sight of the glory of the Lord was like a
    burning fire upon the top of the mount, in the eyes of the
    children of Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses, entering into the midst of the cloud, went
    up into the mountain: and he was there forty days, and forty
    nights.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="25">Exodus 25</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>

    <li><span>Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring
    firstfruits to me: of every man that offereth of his own
    accord, you shall take them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And these are the things you must take: gold, and
    silver, and brass,</span></li>

    <li><span>Violet and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, and fine
    linen, and goats' hair,</span></li>

    <li><span>And rams' skins dyed red, and violet skins, and setim
    wood:</span></li>

    <li><span>Oil to make lights: spices for ointment, and for
    sweetsmelling incense:</span></li>

    <li><span>Onyx stones, and precious stones to adorn the ephod
    and the rational.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they shall make me a sanctuary, and I will dwell
    in the midst of them:</span></li>

    <li><span>According to all the likeness of the tabernacle which
    I will shew thee, and of all the vessels for the service
    thereof: and thus you shall make it:</span></li>

    <li><span>Frame an ark of setim wood, the length whereof shall
    be of two cubits and a half: the breadth, a cubit and a half:
    the height, likewise, a cubit and a half.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt overlay it with the purest gold within
    and without: and over it thou shalt make a golden crown round
    about:</span></li>

    <li><span>And four golden rings, which thou shall put at the
    four corners of the ark: let two rings be on the one side, and
    two on the other.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt make bars also of setim wood, and shalt
    overlay them with gold.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt put them in through the rings that are
    in the sides of the ark, that it may be carried on
    them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they shall be always in the rings, neither shall
    they at any time be drawn out of them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt put in the ark the testimony which I
    will give thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt make also a propitiatory of the purest
    gold: the length thereof shall be two cubits and a half, and
    the breadth a cubit and a half.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt make also two cherubims of beaten gold, on
    the two sides of the oracle.</span></li>

    <li><span>Let one cherub be on the one side, and the other on
    the other.</span></li>

    <li><span>Let them cover both sides of the propitiatory,
    spreading their wings, and covering the oracle, and let them
    look one towards the other, their faces being turned towards
    the propitiatory wherewith the ark is to be
    covered.</span></li>

    <li><span>In which thou shalt put the testimony that I will
    give thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thence will I give orders, and will speak to thee
    over the propitiatory, and from the midst of the two cherubims,
    which shall be upon the ark of the testimony, all things which
    I will command the children of Israel by thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt make a table also of setim wood, of two
    cubits in length, and a cubit in breadth, and a cubit and half
    in height.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt overlay it with the purest gold: and
    thou shalt make to it a golden ledge round about.</span></li>

    <li><span>And to the ledge itself a polished crown, four inches
    high: and over the same another little golden
    crown.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt prepare also four golden rings, and shalt
    put them in the four corners of the same table over each
    foot.</span></li>

    <li><span>Under the crown shall the golden rings be, that the
    bars may be put through them, and the table may be
    carried.</span></li>

    <li><span>The bars also themselves thou shalt make of setim
    wood, and shalt overlay them with gold to bear up the
    table.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt prepare also dishes, and bowls, censers,
    and cups, wherein the libations are to be offered of the purest
    gold.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt set upon the table loaves of
    proposition in my sight always.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt make also a candlestick of beaten work of
    the finest gold, the shaft thereof, and the branches, the cups,

    come out from the shaft:</span></li>

    <li><span>And in the candlestick itself shall be four cups in

    <li><span>Bowls under two branches in three places, which

    <li><span>The snuffers also and where the snuffings shall be
    put out, shall be made of the purest gold.</span></li>

    together the boards on one side of the tabernacle.</span></li>

    <li><span>And five others on the other side, and as many at the
    west side:</span></li>

    <li><span>And they shall be put along by the midst of the
    boards from one end to the other.</span></li>

    <li><span>The boards also themselves thou shalt overlay with
    gold, and shall cast rings of gold to be set upon them, for
    places for the bars to hold together boardwork: which bars thou
    shalt cover with plates of gold.</span></li>

  <h2><a name="28">Exodus 28</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Take unto thee also Aaron thy brother with his sons,
    from among the children of Israel, that they may minister to me
    in the priest's office: Aaron, Nadab, and Abiu, Eleazar, and
    Ithamar.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt make a holy vesture for Aaron thy
    brother for glory and for beauty.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt speak to all the wise of heart, whom I
    have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make
    Aaron's vestments, in which he being consecrated may minister
    to me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And these shall be the vestments that they shall
    make: A rational and an ephod, a tunick and a strait linen
    garment, a mitre and a girdle. They shall make the holy
    vestments for thy brother Aaron and his sons, that they may do
    the office of priesthood unto me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they shall take gold, and violet, and purple, and
    scarlet twice dyed, and fine linen.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they shall make the ephod of gold, and violet,
    and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, and fine twisted linen,
    embroidered with divers colours.</span></li>

    <li><span>It shall have the two edges joined in the top on both
    sides, that they may be closed together.</span></li>

    <li><span>The very workmanship also and all the variety of the
    work shall be of gold, and violet, and purple, and scarlet
    twice dyed, and fine twisted linen.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt take two onyx stones, and shalt grave
    on them the names of the children of Israel:</span></li>

    <li><span>Six names on one stone, and the other six on the
    other, according to the order of their birth.</span></li>

    <li><span>With the work of an engraver and the graving of a
    jeweller, thou shalt engrave them with the names of the
    children of Israel, set in gold and compassed
    about:</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt put them in both sides of the ephod, a
    memorial for the children of Israel. And Aaron shall bear their
    names before the Lord upon both shoulders, for a
    remembrance.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt make also hooks of gold.</span></li>

    <li><span>And two little chains of the purest gold linked one
    to another, which thou shalt put into the hooks.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt make the rational of judgment with
    embroidered work of divers colours, according to the
    workmanship of the ephod, of gold, violet, and purple, and
    scarlet twice dyed, and fine twisted linen.</span></li>

    <li><span>It shall be foursquare and doubled: it shall be the
    measure of a span both in length and in breadth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt set in it four rows of stones: in the
    first row shall be a sardius stone, and a topaz, and an
    emerald:</span></li>

    <li><span>In the second a carbuncle, a sapphire and a
    jasper.</span></li>

    <li><span>In the third a ligurius, an agate, and an
    amethyst:</span></li>

    <li><span>In the fourth a chrysolite, an onyx, and a beryl.
    They shall be set in gold by their rows.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they shall have the names of the children of
    Israel: with twelve names shall they be engraved, each stone
    with the name of one according to the twelve
    tribes.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt make on the rational chains linked one
    to another of the purest gold:</span></li>

    <li><span>And two rings of gold, which thou shalt put in the
    two ends at the top of the rational.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the golden chains thou shalt join to the rings,
    that are in the ends thereof:</span></li>

    <li><span>And the ends of the chains themselves thou shalt join
    together with two hooks on both sides of the ephod, which is
    towards the rational.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt make also two rings of gold which thou
    shalt put in the top parts of the rational, in the borders that
    are over against the ephod, and look towards the back parts
    thereof.</span></li>

    <li><span>Moreover also other two rings of gold, which are to
    be set on each side of the ephod beneath, that looketh towards
    the nether joining, that the rational may be fitted with the
    ephod,</span></li>

    <li><span>And may be fastened by the rings thereof unto the
    rings of the ephod with a violet fillet, that the joining
    artificially wrought may continue, and the rational and the
    ephod may not be loosed one from the other.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of
    Israel in the rational of judgement upon his breast, when he
    shall enter into the sanctuary, a memorial before the Lord for
    ever.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt put in the rational of judgment
    doctrine and truth, which shall be on Aaron's breast, when he
    shall go in before the Lord: and he shall bear the judgment of
    the children of Israel on his breast, in the sight of the Lord
    always.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt make the tunick of the ephod all of
    violet,</span></li>

    <li><span>In the midst whereof above shall be a hole for the
    head, and a border round about it woven, as is wont to be made
    in the outmost parts of garments, that it may not easily be
    broken.</span></li>

    <li><span>And beneath at the feet of the same tunick round
    about, thou shalt make as it were pomegranates, of violet, and
    purple, and scarlet twice dyed, with little bells set
    between:</span></li>

    <li><span>So that there shall be a golden bell and a
    pomegranate, and again another golden bell and a
    pomegranate.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Aaron shall be vested with it in the office of
    his ministry, that the sound may be heard, when he goeth in and
    cometh out of the sanctuary, in the sight of the Lord, and that
    he may not die.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt make also a plate of the purest gold:
    wherein thou shalt grave with engraver's work, Holy to the
    Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt tie it with a violet fillet, and it
    shall be upon the mitre,</span></li>

    <li><span>Hanging over the forehead of the high priest. And
    Aaron shall bear the iniquities of those things, which the
    children of Israel have offered and sanctified, in all their
    gifts and offerings. And the plate shall be always on his
    forehead, that the Lord may be well pleased with
    them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt gird the tunick with fine linen, and
    thou shalt make a fine linen mitre, and a girdle of embroidered
    work.</span></li>

    <li><span>Moreover for the sons of Aaron thou shalt prepare
    linen tunicks, and girdles and mitres for glory and
    beauty:</span></li>

    <li><span>And with all these things thou shalt vest Aaron thy
    brother, and his sons with him. And thou shalt consecrate the
    hands of them all, and shalt sanctify them, that they may do
    the office of priesthood unto me.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt make also linen breeches, to cover the
    flesh of their nakedness from the reins to the
    thighs:</span></li>

    <li><span>And Aaron and his sons shall use them when they shall
    go in to the tabernacle of the testimony, or when they approach
    the altar to minister in the sanctuary, lest being guilty of
    iniquity they die. It shall be a law for ever to Aaron, and to
    his seed after him.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="29">Exodus 29</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And thou shalt also do this, that they may be
    consecrated to me in priesthood. Take a calf from the herd, and
    two rams without blemish,</span></li>

    <li><span>And unleavened bread, and a cake without leaven,
    tempered with oil, wafers also unleavened anointed with oil:
    thou shalt make them all of wheaten flour.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt put them in a basket and offer them:
    and the calf and the two rams.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons to the door
    of the tabernacle of the testimony. And when thou hast washed
    the father and his sons with water,</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt clothe Aaron with his vestments, that is,
    with the linen garment and the tunick, and the ephod and the
    rational, which thou shalt gird with the girdle.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt put the mitre upon his head, and the
    holy plate upon the mitre,</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt pour the oil of unction upon his head:
    and by this rite shall he be consecrated.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt bring his sons also and shalt put on them
    the linen tunicks, and gird them with a girdle:</span></li>

    <li><span>To wit, Aaron and his children, and thou shalt put
    mitres upon them: and they shall be priests to me by a
    perpetual ordinance. After thou shalt have consecrated their
    hands,</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt present also the calf before the
    tabernacle of the testimony. And Aaron and his sons shall lay
    their hands upon his head,</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt kill him in the sight of the Lord,
    beside the door of the tabernacle of the testimony.</span></li>

    <li><span>And taking some of the blood of the calf, thou shalt
    put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and the
    rest of the blood thou shalt pour at the bottom
    thereof.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt take also all the fat that covereth the
    entrails, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and
    the fat that is upon them, and shalt offer a burnt offering
    upon the altar:</span></li>

    <li><span>But the flesh of the calf and the hide and the dung,
    thou shalt burn abroad, without the camp, because it is for
    sin.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt take also one ram upon the head whereof
    Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when thou hast killed him, thou shalt take of the
    blood thereof, and pour round about the altar:</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and having
    washed his entrails and feet, thou shalt put them upon the
    flesh that is cut in pieces, and upon his head.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt offer the whole ram for a burnt
    offering upon the altar: it is an oblation to the Lord, a most
    sweet savour of the victim of the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt take also the other ram, upon whose head
    Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when thou hast sacrificed him, thou shalt take of
    his blood, and put upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron and
    of his sons, and upon the thumbs and great toes of their right
    hand and foot, and thou shalt pour the blood upon the altar
    round about.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when thou hast taken of the blood, that is upon
    the altar, and of the oil of unction, thou shalt sprinkle Aaron
    and his vesture, his sons and their vestments. And after they
    and their vestments are consecrated,</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt take the fat of the ram, and the rump, and
    the fat that covereth the lungs, and the caul of the liver, and
    the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right
    shoulder, because it is the ram of consecration.</span></li>

    <li><span>And one roll of bread, a cake tempered with oil, a
    wafer out of the basket of unleavened bread, which is set in
    the sight of the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt put all upon the hands of Aaron and of
    his sons, and shalt sanctify them elevating before the
    Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt take all from their hands, and shalt
    burn them upon the altar for a holocaust, a most sweet savour
    in the sight of the Lord, because it is his
    oblation.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt take also the breast of the ram, wherewith
    Aaron was consecrated, and elevating it thou shalt sanctify it
    before the Lord, and it shall fall to thy share.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt sanctify both the consecrated breast,
    and the shoulder that thou didst separate of the
    ram,</span></li>

    <li><span>Wherewith Aaron was consecrated and his sons, and
    they shall fall to Aarons share and his sons' by a perpetual
    right from the children of Israel: because they are the
    choicest and the beginnings of their peace victims which they
    offer to the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the holy vesture, which Aaron shall use, his sons
    shall have after him, that they may be anointed, and their
    hands consecrated to it.</span></li>

    <li><span>He of his sons that shall be appointed high priest in
    his stead, and that shall enter into the tabernacle of the
    testimony to minister in the sanctuary, shall wear it seven
    days.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and
    shalt boil the flesh thereof in the holy place:</span></li>

    <li><span>And Aaron and his sons shall eat it. The loaves also,
    that are in the basket, they shall eat in the entry of the
    tabernacle of the testimony,</span></li>

    <li><span>That it may be an atoning sacrifice, and the hands of
    the offerers may be sanctified. A stranger shall not eat of
    them, because they are holy.</span></li>

    <li><span>And if there remain of the consecrated flash, or of
    the bread till the morning, thou shalt burn the remainder with
    fire: they shall not be eaten, because they are
    sanctified.</span></li>

    <li><span>All that I have commanded thee, thou shalt do unto
    Aaron and his sons. Seven days shalt thou consecrate their
    hands:</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt offer a calf for sin every day for
    expiation. And thou shalt cleanse the altar when thou hast
    offered the victim of expiation, and shalt anoint it to
    sanctify it.</span></li>

    <li><span>Seven days shalt thou expiate the altar and sanctify
    it, and it shall be most holy. Every one that shall touch it
    shall be holy.</span></li>

    <li><span>This is what thou shalt sacrifice upon the altar: Two
    lambs of a year old every day continually.</span></li>

    <li><span>One lamb in the morning and another in the
    evening.</span></li>

    <li><span>With one lamb a tenth part of flour tempered with
    beaten oil, of the fourth part of a hin, and wine for libation
    of the same measure.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the other lamb thou shalt offer in the evening,
    according to the rite of the morning oblation, and according to
    what we have said, for a savour of sweetness:</span></li>

    <li><span>It is a sacrifice to the Lord, by perpetual oblation
    unto your generations, at the door of the tabernacle of the
    testimony before the Lord, where I will appoint to speak unto
    thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>And there will I command the children of Israel, and
    the altar shall be sanctified by my glory.</span></li>

    <li><span>I will sanctify also the tabernacle of the testimony
    with the altar, and Aaron with his sons, to do the office of
    priesthood unto me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I will dwell in the midst of the children of
    Israel, and will be their God:</span></li>

    <li><span>And they shall know that I am the Lord their God, who
    have brought them out of the land of Egypt, that I might abide
    among them, I the Lord their God.</span></li>

    that hangeth before the ark of the testimony before the
    propitiatory wherewith the testimony is covered, where I will
    speak to thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Aaron shall burn sweet smelling incense upon it
    in the morning. When he shall dress the lamps, he shall burn
    it:</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he shall place them in the evening, he shall
    burn an everlasting incense before the Lord throughout your
    generations.</span></li>

    <li><span>You shall not offer upon it incense of another
    composition nor oblation, and victim, neither shall you offer
    libations.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Aaron shall pray upon the horns thereof once a
    year, with the blood of that which was offered for sin, and
    shall make atonement upon it in your generations. It shall be
    most holy to the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>

    <li><span>When thou shalt take the sum of the children of
    Israel according to their number, every one of them shall give
    a price for their souls to the Lord, and there shall be no
    scourge among them, when they shall be reckoned.</span></li>

    <li><span>And this shall every one give that passeth at the
    naming, half a sicle according to the standard of the temple. A
    sicle hath twenty obols. Half a sicle shall be offered to the
    Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>He that is counted in the number from twenty years
    and upwards, shall give the price.</span></li>

    <li><span>The rich man shall not add to half a sicle, and the
    poor man shall diminish nothing.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the money received which was contributed by the
    children of Israel, thou shalt deliver unto the uses of the
    tabernacle of the testimony, that it may be a memorial of them
    before the Lord, and he may be merciful to their
    souls.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt make also a brazen laver with its foot, to
    wash in: and thou shalt set it between the tabernacle of the
    testimony and the altar. And water being put into
    it,</span></li>

    <li><span>Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and feet in
    it:</span></li>

    <li><span>When they are going into the tabernacle of the
    testimony, and when they are to come to the altar, to offer on
    it incense to the Lord,</span></li>

    <li><span>Lest perhaps they die. It shall be an everlasting law
    to him, and to his seed by successions.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses,</span></li>

    <li><span>Saying: Take spices, of principal and chosen myrrh
    five hundred sicles, and of cinnamon half so much, that is, two
    hundred and fifty sicles, of calamus in like manner two hundred
    and fifty.</span></li>

    <li><span>And of cassia five hundred sicles by the weight of
    the sanctuary, of oil of olives the measure hin:</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt make the holy oil of unction, an
    ointment compounded after the art of the perfumer,</span></li>

    <li><span>And therewith thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the
    testimony, and the ark of the testament,</span></li>

    <li><span>And the table with the vessels thereof, the
    candlestick and furniture thereof, the altars of
    incense,</span></li>

    <li><span>And of holocaust, and all the furniture that
    belongeth to the service of them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt sanctify all, and they shall be most
    holy: he that shall touch them shall be sanctified.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and shalt
    sanctify them, that they may do the office of priesthood unto
    me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt say to the children of Israel: This
    oil of unction shall be holy unto me throughout your
    generations.</span></li>

    <li><span>The flesh of man shall not be anointed therewith, and
    you shall make none other of the same composition, because it
    is sanctified, and shall be holy unto you.</span></li>

    <li><span>What man soever shall compound such, and shall give
    thereof to a stranger, he shall be cut off from his
    people.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Take unto thee spices,
    stacte, and onycha, galbanum of sweet savour, and the clearest
    frankincense, all shall be of equal weight.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt make incense compounded by the work of
    the perfumer, well tempered together, and pure, and most worthy
    of sanctification.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when thou has beaten all into very small powder,
    thou shalt set of it before the tabernacle of the testimony, in
    the place where I will appear to thee. Most holy shall this
    incense be to you.</span></li>

    <li><span>You shall not make such a composition for your own
    uses, because it is holy to the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>What man soever shall make the like, to enjoy the
    smell thereof, he shall perish out of his people.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="31">Exodus 31</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>

    <li><span>Behold, I have called by name Beseleel the son of Uri
    the son of Hur of the tribe of Juda,</span></li>

    <li><span>And I have filled him with the spirit of God, with
    wisdom and understanding, and knowledge in all manner of
    work.</span></li>

    <li><span>To devise whatsoever may be artificially made of
    gold, and silver, and brass,</span></li>

    <li><span>Of marble, and precious stones, and variety of
    wood.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I have given him for his companion Ooliab the son
    of Achisamech of the tribe of Dan. And I have put wisdom in the
    heart of every skilful man, that they may make all things which
    I have commanded thee,</span></li>

    <li><span>The tabernacle of the covenant, and the ark of the
    testimony, and the propitiatory that is over it, and all the
    vessels of the tabernacle,</span></li>

    <li><span>And the table and the vessels thereof, the most pure
    candlestick with the vessels thereof, and the altars of
    incense,</span></li>

    <li><span>And of holocaust, and all their vessels, the laver
    with its foot,</span></li>

    <li><span>The holy vestments in the ministry for Aaron the
    priest, and for his sons, that they may execute their office
    about the sacred things:</span></li>

    <li><span>The oil of unction, and the incense of spices in the
    sanctuary, all things which I have commanded thee, shall they
    make.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>

    <li><span>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say
    to them: See that thou keep my sabbath: because it is a sign
    between me and you in your generations: that you may know that
    I am the Lord, who sanctify you.</span></li>

    <li><span>Keep you my sabbath: for it is holy unto you: he that
    shall profane it, shall be put to death: he that shall do my
    work in it, his soul shall perish out of the midst of his
    people.</span></li>

    <li><span>Six days shall you do work: in the seventh day is the
    sabbath, the rest holy to the Lord. Every one that shall do any
    work on this day, shall die.</span></li>

    <li><span>Let the children of Israel keep the sabbath, and
    celebrate it in their generations. It is an everlasting
    covenant</span></li>

    <li><span>Between me and the children of Israel, and a
    perpetual sign. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth,
    and in the seventh he ceased from work.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord, when he had ended these words in mount
    Sinai, gave to Moses two stone tables of testimony, written
    with the finger of God.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="32">Exodus 32</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And the people seeing that Moses delayed to come down
    from the mount, gathering together against Aaron, said: Arise,
    make us gods, that may go before us: for as to this Moses, the
    man that brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what
    has befallen him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Aaron said to them: Take the golden earrings from
    the ears of your wives, and your sons and daughters, and bring
    them to me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the people did what he had commanded, bringing
    the earrings to Aaron.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had received them, he fashioned them by
    founders' work, and made of them a molten calf. And they said:
    These are thy gods, O Israel, that have brought thee out of the
    land of Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it,
    and made proclamation by a crier's voice, saying: To morrow is
    the solemnity of the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And rising in the morning, they offered holocausts,
    and peace victims, and the people sat down to eat, and drink,
    and they rose up to play.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: Go, get thee
    down: thy people, which thou hast brought out of the land of
    Egypt, hath sinned.</span></li>

    <li><span>They have quickly strayed from the way which thou
    didst shew them: and they have made to themselves a molten
    calf, and have adored it, and sacrificing victims to it, have
    said: These are thy gods, O Israel, that have brought thee out
    of the land of Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>And again the Lord said to Moses: See that this
    people is stiffnecked:</span></li>

    <li><span>Let me alone, that my wrath may be kindled against
    them, and that I may destroy them, and I will make of thee a
    great nation.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Moses besought the Lord his God, saying: Why, O
    Lord, is thy indignation kindled against thy people, whom thou
    hast brought out of the land of Egypt, with great power, and
    with a mighty hand?</span></li>

    <li><span>Let not the Egyptians say, I beseech thee: He
    craftily brought them out, that he might kill them in the
    mountains, and destroy them from the earth: let thy anger
    cease, and be appeased upon the wickedness of thy
    people.</span></li>

    <li><span>Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to
    whom thou sworest by thy own self, saying: I will multiply your
    seed as the stars of heaven: and this whole land that I have
    spoken of, I will give to you seed, and you shall possess it
    for ever.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord was appeased from doing the evil which
    he had spoken against his people.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses returned from the mount, carrying the two
    tables of the testimony in his hand, written on both
    sides,</span></li>

    <li><span>And made by the work of God: the writing also of God
    was graven in the tables.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Josue hearing the noise of the people shouting,
    said to Moses: The noise of battle is heard in the
    camp.</span></li>

    <li><span>But he answered: It is not the cry of men encouraging
    to fight, nor the shout of men compelling to flee: but I hear
    the voice of singers.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he came nigh to the camp, he saw the calf,
    and the dances: and being very angry, he threw the tables out
    of his hand, and broke them at the foot of the
    mount:</span></li>

    <li><span>And laying hold of the calf which they had made, he
    burnt it, and beat it to powder, which he strowed into water,
    and gave thereof to the children of Israel to
    drink.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to Aaron: What has this people done to
    thee, that thou shouldst bring upon them a most heinous
    sin?</span></li>

    <li><span>And he answered him: Let not my lord be offended: for
    thou knowest this people, that they are prone to
    evil.</span></li>

    <li><span>They said to me: Make us gods, that may go before us:
    for as to this Moses, who brought us forth out of the land of
    Egypt, we know not what is befallen him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I said to them: Which of you hath any gold? and
    they took and brought it to me: and I cast it into the fire,
    and this calf came out.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Moses saw that the people were naked, (for
    Aaron had stripped them by occasion of the shame of the filth,
    and had set them naked among their enemies,)</span></li>

    <li><span>Then standing in the gate of the camp, he said: If
    any man be on the Lord's side let him join with me. And all the
    sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him:</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to them: Thus saith the Lord God of
    Israel: Put every man his sword upon his thigh: go, and return
    from gate to gate through the midst of the camp, and let every
    man kill his brother, and friend, and neighbour.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the sons of Levi did according to the words of
    Moses, and there were slain that day about three and twenty
    thousand men.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses said: You have consecrated your hands this
    day to the Lord, every man in his son and in his brother, that
    a blessing may be given to you.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the next day was come, Moses spoke to the
    people: You have sinned a very great sin: I will go up to the
    Lord, if by any means I may be able to entreat him for your
    crime.</span></li>

    <li><span>And returning to the Lord, he said: I beseech thee:
    this people hath sinned a heinous sin, and they have made to
    themselves gods of gold: either forgive them this
    trespass,</span></li>

    <li><span>Or if thou do not, strike me out of the book that
    thou hast written.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord answered him: He that hath sinned
    against me, him will I strike out of my book:</span></li>

    <li><span>But go thou, and lead this people whither I have told
    thee: my angel shall go before thee. And I in the day of
    revenge will visit this sin also of theirs.</span></li>

    <li><span>The Lord therefore struck the people for the guilt on
    occasion of the calf which Aaron had made.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="33">Exodus 33</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: God, get thee up
    from this place, thou and thy people which thou has brought out
    of the land of Egypt, into the land concerning which I swore to
    Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying: To thy seed I will give
    it.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I will send an angel before thee, that I may cast
    out the Chanaanite, and the Amorrhite, and the Hethite, and the
    Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite.</span></li>

    <li><span>That thou mayst enter into the land that floweth with
    milk and honey. For I will not go up with thee, because thou
    art a stiffnecked people: lest I destroy thee in the
    way.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the people hearing these very bad tidings,
    mourned: and no man put on his ornaments according to
    custom.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Say to the children of
    Israel: Thou are a stiffnecked people; once I shall come up in
    the midst of thee, and shall destroy thee. Now presently lay
    aside thy ornaments, that I may know what to do with
    thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>So the children of Israel laid aside their ornaments
    by mount Horeb.</span></li>

    <li><span>Moses also taking the tabernacle, pitched it without
    the camp afar off, and called the name thereof, The tabernacle
    of the covenant. And all the people that had any question, went
    forth to the tabernacle of the covenant, without the
    camp.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Moses went forth to the tabernacle, all the
    people rose up, and every one stood in the door of his
    pavilion, and they beheld the back of Moses, till he went into
    the tabernacle.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he was gone into the tabernacle of the
    covenant, the pillar of the cloud came down, and stood at the
    door, and he spoke with Moses.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all saw that the pillar of the cloud stood at the
    door of the tabernacle. And they stood, and worshipped at the
    doors of their tents.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses face to face, as a man is
    wont to speak to his friend. And when he returned into the
    camp, his servant Josue the son of Nun, a young man, departed
    not from the tabernacle.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses said to the Lord; Thou commandest me to
    lead forth this people: and thou dost not let me know whom thou
    wilt send with me, especially whereas thou hast said: I know
    thee by name, and thou hast found favour in my
    sight.</span></li>

    <li><span>If therefore I have found favour in thy sight, show
    me thy face, that I may know thee, and may find grace before
    thy eyes: look upon thy people this nation.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said: My face shall go before thee, and
    I will give thee rest.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses said: If thou thyself dost not go before,
    bring us not out of this place.</span></li>

    <li><span>For how shall we be able to know, I and thy people,
    that we have found grace in thy sight, unless thou walk with
    us, that we may be glorified by all people that dwell upon the
    earth?</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: This word also, which
    thou hast spoken, will I do: for thou hast found grace before
    me, and thee I have known by name.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said: Shew me thy glory.</span></li>

    <li><span>He answered: I will shew thee all good, and I will
    proclaim in the name of the Lord before thee: and I will have
    mercy on whom I will, and I will be merciful to whom it shall
    please me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And again he said: Thou canst not see my face: for
    man shall not see me and live.</span></li>

    <li><span>And again he said: Behold there is a place with me,
    and thou shalt stand upon the rock.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when my glory shall pass, I will set thee in a
    hole of the rock, and protect thee with my right hand, till I
    pass:</span></li>

    <li><span>And I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see my
    back parts: but my face thou canst not see.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="34">Exodus 34</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And after this he said: Hew thee two tables of stone
    like unto the former, and I will write upon them the words
    which were in the tables, which thou brokest.</span></li>

    <li><span>Be ready in the morning, that thou mayst forthwith go
    up into mount Sinai, and thou shalt stand with me upon the top
    of the mount.</span></li>

    <li><span>Let no man go up with thee: and let not any man be
    seen throughout all the mount: neither let the oxen nor the
    sheep feed over against it.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then he cut out two tables of stone, such as had been
    before: and rising very early he went up into the mount Sinai,
    as the Lord had commanded him, carrying with him the
    tables.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the Lord was come down in a cloud, Moses
    stood with him, calling upon the name of the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he passed before him, he said: O the Lord,
    the Lord God, merciful and gracious, patient and of much
    compassion, and true,</span></li>

    <li><span>Who keepest mercy unto thousands: who takest away
    iniquity, and wickedness, and sin, and no man of himself is
    innocent before thee. Who renderest the iniquity of the fathers
    to the children, and to the grandchildren, unto the third and
    fourth generation.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses making haste, bowed down prostrate unto the
    earth, and adoring,</span></li>

    <li><span>Said: If I have found grace in thy sight: O Lord, I
    beseech thee, that thou wilt go with us, (for it is a
    stiffnecked people,) and take away our iniquities and sin, and
    possess us.</span></li>

    <li><span>The Lord answered: I will make a covenant in the
    sight of all. I will do signs such as were never seen upon the
    earth, nor in any nation: that this people, in the midst of
    whom thou art, may see the terrible work of the Lord which I
    will do.</span></li>

    <li><span>Observe all things which this day I command thee: I
    myself will drive out before thy face the Amorrhite, and the
    Chanaanite, and the Hethite, and the Pherezite, and the Hevite,
    and the Jebusite.</span></li>

    <li><span>Beware thou never join in friendship with the
    inhabitants of that land, which may be thy ruin:</span></li>

    <li><span>But destroy their altars, break their statues, and
    cut down their groves:</span></li>

    <li><span>Adore not any strange god. The Lord his name is
    Jealous, he is a jealous God.</span></li>

    <li><span>Make no covenant with the men of those countries
    lest, when they have committed fornication with their gods, and
    have adored their idols, some one call thee to eat of the
    things sacrificed.</span></li>

    <li><span>Neither shalt thou take of their daughters a wife for
    thy son, lest after they themselves have committed fornication,
    they make thy sons also to commit fornication with their
    gods.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt not make to thyself any molten
    gods.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt keep the feast of the unleavened bread.
    Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee
    in the time of the month of the new corn: for in the month of
    the springtime thou camest out from Egypt.</span></li>

    <li><span>All of the male kind, that openeth the womb, shall be
    mine. Of all beasts, both of oxen and of sheep, it shall be
    mine.</span></li>

    <li><span>The firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a
    sheep: but if thou wilt not give a price for it, it shall be
    slain. The firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem: neither
    shalt thou appear before me empty.</span></li>

    <li><span>Six days shalt thou work, the seventh day thou shalt
    cease to plough, and to reap.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt keep the feast of weeks with the
    firstfruits of the corn of thy wheat harvest, and the feast
    when the time of the year returneth that all things are laid
    in.</span></li>

    <li><span>Three times in a year all thy males shall appear in
    the sight of the Almighty Lord the God of Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>For when I shall have taken away the nations from thy
    face, and shall have enlarged thy borders, no man shall lie in
    wait against thy land when thou shalt go up, and appear in the
    sight of the Lord thy God thrice in a year.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice upon
    leaven: neither shall there remain in the morning any thing of
    the victim of the solemnity of the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>The first of the fruits of thy ground thou shalt
    offer in the house of the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not boil a
    kid in the milk of his dam.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord said to Moses: Write these words by
    which I have made a covenant both with thee and with
    Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he was there with the Lord forty days and forty
    nights: he neither ate bread nor drank water, and he wrote upon
    the tables the ten words of the covenant.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Moses came down from the mount Sinai, he
    held the two tables of the testimony, and he knew not that his
    face was horned from the conversation of the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Aaron and the children of Israel seeing the face
    of Moses horned, were afraid to come near.</span></li>

    <li><span>And being called by him, they returned, both Aaron
    and the rulers of the congregation. And after that he spoke to
    them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the children of Israel came to him: and he
    gave them in commandment all that he had heard of the Lord in
    mount Sinai.</span></li>

    <li><span>And having done speaking, he put a veil upon his
    face.</span></li>

    <li><span>But when he went in to the Lord, and spoke with him,
    he took it away until he came forth, and then he spoke to the
    children of Israel all things that had been commanded
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they saw that the face of Moses when he came out
    was horned, but he covered his face again, if at any time he
    spoke to them.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="35">Exodus 35</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And all the multitude of the children of Israel being
    gathered together, he said to them: These are the things which
    the Lord hath commanded to be done.</span></li>

    <li><span>Six days you shall do work: the seventh day shall be
    holy unto you, the sabbath, and the rest of the Lord: he that
    shall do any work on it, shall be put to death.</span></li>

    <li><span>You shall kindle no fire in any of your habitations
    on the sabbath day.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses said to all the assembly of the children of
    Israel: This is the word the Lord hath commanded,
    saying:</span></li>

    <li><span>Set aside with you firstfuits to the Lord. Let every
    one that is willing and hath a ready heart, offer them to the
    Lord: gold, and silver, and brass,</span></li>

    <li><span>Violet and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, and fine
    linen, goats' hair,</span></li>

    <li><span>And rams' skins dyed red, and violet coloured skins,
    setim wood,</span></li>

    <li><span>And oil to maintain lights, and to make ointment, and
    most sweet incense.</span></li>

    <li><span>Onyx stones, and precious stones, for the adorning of
    the ephod and the rational.</span></li>

    <li><span>Whosoever of you is wise, let him come, and make that
    which the Lord hath commanded:</span></li>

    <li><span>To wit, the tabernacle and the roof thereof, and the
    cover, the rings, and the board work with the oars, the
    pillars, and the sockets:</span></li>

    <li><span>The ark and the staves, the propitiatory, and the
    veil that is drawn before it:</span></li>

    <li><span>The table with the bars and the vessels, and the
    loaves of proposition:</span></li>

    <li><span>The candlestick to bear up the lights, the vessels
    thereof and the lamps, and the oil for the nourishing of
    fires:</span></li>

    <li><span>The altar of incense, and the bars, and the oil of
    unction and the incense of spices: the hanging at the door of
    the tabernacle:</span></li>

    <li><span>The altar of holocaust, and its grate of brass, with
    the bars and vessels thereof: the laver and its
    foot:</span></li>

    <li><span>The curtains of the court with the pillars and the
    sockets, the hanging in the doors of the entry,</span></li>

    <li><span>The pins of the tabernacle and of the court with
    their little cords:</span></li>

    <li><span>The vestments that are to be used in the ministry of
    the sanctuary, the vesture of Aaron the high priest, and of his
    sons, to do the office of priesthood to me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the multitude of the children of Israel going
    out from the presence of Moses,</span></li>

    <li><span>Offered firstfruits to the Lord with a most ready and
    devout mind, to make the work of the tabernacle of the
    testimony. Whatsoever was necessary to the service, and to the
    holy vestments,</span></li>

    <li><span>Both men and women gave bracelets and earrings, rings
    and tablets: every vessel of gold was set aside to be offered
    to the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>If any man had violet, and purple, and scarlet twice
    dyed, fine linen and goats' hair, rams' skins dyed red, and
    violet coloured skins,</span></li>

    <li><span>Metal of silver and brass, they offered it to the
    Lord, and setim wood for divers uses.</span></li>

    <li><span>The skilful women also gave such things as they had
    spun, violet, purple, and scarlet, and fine linen,</span></li>

    <li><span>And goats' hair, giving all of their own
    accord.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the princes offered onyx stone, and precious
    stones, for the ephod and the rational,</span></li>

    <li><span>And spices and oil for the lights, and for the
    preparing of ointment, and to make the incense of most sweet
    savour.</span></li>

    <li><span>All both men and women with devout mind offered
    gifts, that the works might be done which the Lord had
    commanded by the hand of Moses. All the children of Israel
    dedicated voluntary offerings to the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses said to the children of Israel: Behold the
    Lord hath called by name Beseleel the son of Uri the son of Hur
    of the tribe of Juda.</span></li>

    <li><span>And hath filled him with the spirit of God, with
    wisdom and understanding and knowledge and all
    learning.</span></li>

    <li><span>To devise and to work in gold and silver and
    brass,</span></li>

    <li><span>And in engraving stones, and in carpenters' work.
    Whatsoever can be devised artificially,</span></li>

    <li><span>He hath given in his heart: Ooliab also the son of
    Achisamech of the tribe of Dan:</span></li>

    <li><span>Both of them hath he instructed with wisdom, to do
    carpenters' work and tapestry, and embroidery in blue and
    purple, and scarlet twice dyed, and fine linen, and to weave
    all things, and to invent all new things.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="36">Exodus 36</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Beseleel, therefore, and Ooliab, and every wise man,
    to whom the Lord gave wisdom and understanding, to know how to
    work artificially, made the things that are necessary for the
    uses of the sanctuary, and which the Lord
    commanded.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Moses had called them, and every skilful
    man, to whom the Lord had given wisdom, and such as of their
    own accord had offered themselves to the making of the
    work,</span></li>

    <li><span>He delivered all the offerings of the children of
    Israel unto them. And while they were earnest about the work,
    the people daily in the morning offered their vows.</span></li>

    <li><span>Whereupon the workmen being constrained to
    come,</span></li>

    <li><span>Said to Moses: The people offereth more than is
    necessary.</span></li>

    <li><span>Moses therefore commanded proclamation to be made by
    the crier's voice: Let neither man nor woman offer any more for
    the work of the sanctuary. And so they ceased from offering
    gifts,</span></li>

    <li><span>Because the things that were offered did suffice, and
    were too much.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the men that were wise of heart, to
    accomplish the work of the tabernacle, made ten curtains of
    twisted fine linen, and violet, and purple, and scarlet twice
    dyed, with varied work, and the art of
    embroidering:</span></li>

    <li><span>The length of one curtain was twenty-eight cubits,
    and the breadth four: all the curtains were of the same
    size.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he joined five curtains, one to another, and the
    other five he coupled one to another.</span></li>

    <li><span>He made also loops of violet in the edge of the
    curtain on both sides, and in the edge of the other curtain in
    like manner,</span></li>

    <li><span>That the loops might meet on against another, and
    might be joined each with the other.</span></li>

    <li><span>Whereupon also he cast fifty rings of gold, that
    might catch the loops of the curtains, and they might be made
    one tabernacle.</span></li>

    <li><span>He made also eleven curtains of goats' hair, to cover
    the roof of the tabernacle:</span></li>

    <li><span>One curtain was thirty cubits long and four cubits
    broad: all the curtains were of one measure.</span></li>

    <li><span>Five of which he joined apart, and the other six
    apart.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he made fifty loops in the edge of one curtain,
    and fifty in the edge of another curtain, that they might be
    joined one to another.</span></li>

    <li><span>And fifty buckles of brass wherewith the roof might
    be knit together, that of all the curtains there might be made
    one covering.</span></li>

    <li><span>He made also a cover for the tabernacle of rams'
    skins dyed red: and another cover over that of violet
    skins.</span></li>

    <li><span>He made also the boards of the tabernacle of setim
    wood standing.</span></li>

    <li><span>The length of one board was ten cubits: and the
    breadth was one cubit and a half.</span></li>

    <li><span>There were two mortises throughout every board, that
    one might be joined to the other. And in this manner he made
    for all the boards of the tabernacle.</span></li>

    <li><span>Of which twenty were at the south side
    southward,</span></li>

    <li><span>With forty sockets of silver, two sockets were put
    under one board on the two sides of the corners, where the
    mortises of the sides end in the corners.</span></li>

    <li><span>At that side also of the tabernacle, that looketh
    toward the north, he made twenty boards.</span></li>

    <li><span>With forty sockets of silver, two sockets for every
    board.</span></li>

    <li><span>But against the west, to wit, at that side of the
    tabernacle, which looketh to the sea, he made six
    boards,</span></li>

    <li><span>And two others at each corner of the tabernacle
    behind:</span></li>

    <li><span>Which were also joined from beneath unto the top, and
    went together into one joint. Thus he did on both sides at the
    corners:</span></li>

    <li><span>So there were in all eight boards and they had
    sixteen sockets of silver, to wit, two sockets under every
    board.</span></li>

    <li><span>He made also bars of setim wood, five to hold
    together the boards of one side of the tabernacle,</span></li>

    <li><span>And five others to join together the boards of the
    other side: and besides these, five other bars at the west side
    of the tabernacle towards the sea.</span></li>

    <li><span>He made also another bar, that might come by the
    midst of the boards from corner to corner.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the board works themselves he overlaid with gold,
    casting for them sockets of silver. And their rings he made of
    gold, through which the bars might be drawn: and he covered the
    bars themselves with plates of gold.</span></li>

    <li><span>He made also a veil of violet, and purple, scarlet,
    and fine twisted linen, varied and distinguished with
    embroidery:</span></li>

    <li><span>And four pillars of setim wood, which with their
    heads be overlaid with gold, casting for them sockets of
    silver.</span></li>

    <li><span>He made also a hanging in the entry of the tabernacle
    of violet, purple, scarlet, and fine twisted linen, with the
    work of an embroiderer.</span></li>

    <li><span>And five pillars with their heads, which he covered
    with gold, and their sockets he cast of brass.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="37">Exodus 37</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And Beseleel made also the ark of setim wood: it was
    two cubits and a half in length, and a cubit and a half in
    breadth, and the height was of one cubit and a half: and he
    overlaid it with the purest gold within and
    without.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he made to it a crown of gold round
    about,</span></li>

    <li><span>Casting four rings of gold at the four corners
    thereof: two rings in one side, and two in the
    other.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he made bars of setim wood, which he overlaid
    with gold,</span></li>

    <li><span>And he put them into the rings that were at the sides
    of the ark to carry it.</span></li>

    <li><span>He made also the propitiatory, that is, the oracle,
    of the purest gold, two cubits and a half in length, and a
    cubit and a half in breadth.</span></li>

    <li><span>Two cherubims also of beaten gold, which he set on
    the two sides of the propitiatory:</span></li>

    <li><span>One cherub in the top of one side, and the other
    cherub in the top of the other side: two cherubims at the two
    ends of the propitiatory,</span></li>

    <li><span>Spreading their wings, and covering the propitiatory,
    and looking one towards the other, and towards it.</span></li>

    <li><span>He made also the table of setim wood, in length two
    cubits, and in breadth one cubit, and in height it was a cubit
    and a half.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he overlaid it with the finest gold, and he made
    to it a golden ledge round about.</span></li>

    <li><span>And to the ledge itself he made a polished crown of
    gold, of four fingers' breadth, and upon the same another
    golden crown.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he cast four rings of gold, which he put in the
    four corners at each foot of the table,</span></li>

    <li><span>Over against the crown: and he put the bars into
    them, that the table might be carried.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the bars also themselves he made of setim wood,
    and overlaid them with gold,</span></li>

    <li><span>And the vessels for the divers uses of the table,
    dishes, bowls, and cups, and censers of pure gold, wherein the
    libations are to be offered.</span></li>

    <li><span>He made also the candlestick of beaten work of the
    finest gold. From the shaft whereof its branches, its cups, and
    bowls, and lilies came out:</span></li>

    <li><span>Six on the two sides: three branches on one side, and
    three on the other.</span></li>

    <li><span>Three cups in manner of a nut on each branch, and
    bowls withal and lilies; and three cups of the fashion of a nut
    in another branch, and bowls withal and lilies. The work of the
    six branches that went out from the shaft of the candlestick
    was equal.</span></li>

    <li><span>And in the shaft itself were four cups after the
    manner of a nut, and bowls withal at every one, and
    lilies:</span></li>

    <li><span>And bowls under two branches in three places, which
    together make six branches going out from one
    shaft.</span></li>

    <li><span>So both the bowls, and the branches were of the same,
    all beaten work of the purest gold.</span></li>

    <li><span>He made also the seven lamps with their snuffers, and
    the vessels where the snuffings were to be put out, of the
    purest gold.</span></li>

    <li><span>The candlestick with all the vessels thereof weighed
    a talent of gold.</span></li>

    <li><span>He made also the altar of incense of setim wood,
    being a cubit on every side foursquare, and in height two
    cubits: from the corners of which went out horns.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he overlaid it with the purest gold, with its
    grate and the sides, and the horns.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he made to it a crown of gold round about, and
    two golden rings under the crown at each side, that the bars
    might be put into them, and the altar be carried.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the bars themselves he made also of setim wood,
    and overlaid them with plates of gold.</span></li>

    <li><span>He compounded also the oil for the ointment of
    sanctification, and incense of the purest spices, according to
    the work of a perfumer.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="38">Exodus 38</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>He made also the altar of holocaust of setim wood,
    five cubits square, and three in height:</span></li>

    <li><span>The horns whereof went out from the corners, and he
    overlaid it with plates of brass.</span></li>

    <li><span>And for the uses thereof, he prepared divers vessels
    of brass, cauldrons, tongs, fleshhooks, pothooks, and
    firepans.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he made the grate thereof of brass, in manner of
    a net, and under it in the midst of the altar a
    hearth,</span></li>

    <li><span>Casting four rings at the four ends of the net at the
    top, to put in bars to carry it.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he made the bars of setim wood, and overlaid them
    with plates of brass:</span></li>

    <li><span>And he drew them through the rings that stood out in
    the sides of the altar. And the altar itself was not solid, but
    hollow, of boards, and empty within.</span></li>

    <li><span>He made also the laver of brass, with the foot
    thereof, of the mirrors of the women that watch at the door of
    the tabernacle.</span></li>

    <li><span>He made also the court, in the south side whereof
    were hangings of fine twisted linen, of a hundred
    cubits,</span></li>

    <li><span>Twenty pillars of brass with their sockets, the heads
    of the pillars, and the whole graving of the work, of
    silver.</span></li>

    <li><span>In like manner at the north side the hangings, the
    pillars, and the sockets and heads of the pillars were of the
    same measure, and work and metal.</span></li>

    <li><span>But on that side that looketh to the west, there were
    hangings of fifty cubits, ten pillars of brass with their
    sockets, and the heads of the pillars, and all the graving of
    the work, of silver.</span></li>

    <li><span>Moreover towards the east he prepared hangings of
    fifty cubits:</span></li>

    <li><span>Fifteen cubits of which were on one side with three
    pillars, and their sockets:</span></li>

    <li><span>And on the other side (for between the two he made
    the entry of the tabernacle) there were hangings equally of
    fifteen cubits, and three pillars, and as many
    sockets.</span></li>

    <li><span>All the hangings of the court were woven with twisted
    linen.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sockets of the pillars were of brass, and their
    heads with all their gravings of silver: and he overlaid the
    pillars of the court also with silver.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he made in the entry thereof an embroidered
    hanging of violet, purple, scarlet, and fine twisted linen,
    that was twenty cubits long, and five cubits high according to
    the measure of all the hangings of the court.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the pillars in the entry were four with sockets
    of brass, and their heads and gravings of silver.</span></li>

    <li><span>The pins also of the tabernacle and of the court
    round about he made of brass.</span></li>

    <li><span>These are the instruments of the tabernacle of the
    testimony, which were counted according to the commandment of
    Moses, in the ceremonies of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar
    son of Aaron the priest:</span></li>

    <li><span>Which Beseleel the son of Uri the son of Hur of the
    tribe of Juda had made as the Lord commanded by
    Moses,</span></li>

    <li><span>Having for his companion Ooliab the son of Achisamech
    of the tribe of Dan: who also was an excellent artificer in
    wood, and worker in tapestry and embroidery in violet, purple,
    scarlet, and fine linen.</span></li>

    <li><span>All the gold that was spent in the work of the
    sanctuary, and that was offered in gifts was nine and twenty
    talents, and seven hundred and thirty sicles according to the
    standard of the sanctuary.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it was offered by them that went to be numbered,
    from twenty years old and upwards, of six hundred and three
    thousand five hundred and fifty men able to bear
    arms.</span></li>

    <li><span>There were moreover a hundred talents of silver,
    whereof were cast the sockets of the sanctuary, and of the
    entry where the veil hangeth.</span></li>

    <li><span>A hundred sockets were made of a hundred talents, one
    talent being reckoned for every socket.</span></li>

    <li><span>And of the thousand seven hundred and seventy-five he
    made the heads of the pillars, which also he overlaid with
    silver.</span></li>

    <li><span>And there were offered of brass also seventy-two
    thousand talents, and four hundred sicles besides.</span></li>

    <li><span>Of which were cast the sockets in the entry of the
    tabernacle of the testimony, and the altar of brass with the
    grate thereof, and all the vessels that belong to the use
    thereof.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the sockets of the court as well round about as
    in the entry thereof, and the pins of the tabernacle and of the
    court round about.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="39">Exodus 39</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And he made, of violet and purple, scarlet and fine
    linen, the vestments for Aaron to wear when he ministered in
    the holy places, as the Lord commanded Moses.</span></li>

    <li><span>So he made an ephod of gold, violet, and purple, and
    scarlet twice dyed, and fine twisted linen.</span></li>

    <li><span>With embroidered work: and he cut thin plates of
    gold, and drew them small into threads, that they might be
    twisted with the woof of the aforesaid colours,</span></li>

    <li><span>And two borders coupled one to the other in the top
    on either side,</span></li>

    <li><span>And a girdle of the same colours, as the Lord had
    commanded Moses.</span></li>

    <li><span>He prepared also two onyx stones, fast set and closed
    in gold, and graven by the art of a lapidary, with the names of
    the children of Israel:</span></li>

    <li><span>And he set them in the sides of the ephod for a
    memorial of the children of Israel, as the Lord had commanded
    Moses.</span></li>

    <li><span>He made also a rational with embroidered work,
    according to the work of the ephod, of gold, violet, purple,
    and scarlet twice dyed, and fine twisted linen,</span></li>

    <li><span>Foursquare, double, of the measure of a
    span.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he set four rows of precious stones in it. In the
    first row was a sardius, a topaz, and emerald.</span></li>

    <li><span>In the second, a carbuncle, a sapphire, and a
    jasper.</span></li>

    <li><span>In the third, a ligurius, an agate, and an
    amethyst.</span></li>

    <li><span>In the fourth, a chrysolite, an onyx, and a beryl,
    set and enclosed in gold by their rows.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the twelve stones were engraved with the names of
    the twelve tribes of Israel, each one with its several
    name.</span></li>

    <li><span>They made also in the rational little chains linked
    one to another of the purest gold,</span></li>

    <li><span>And two hooks, and as many rings of gold. And they
    set the rings on either side of the rational,</span></li>

    <li><span>On which rings the two golden chains should hang,
    which they put into the hooks that stood out in the corners of
    the ephod.</span></li>

    <li><span>These both before and behind so answered one another,
    that the ephod and the rational were bound
    together,</span></li>

    <li><span>Being fastened to the girdle and strongly coupled
    with rings, which a violet fillet joined, lest they should flag
    loose, and be moved one from the other, as the Lord commanded
    Moses.</span></li>

    <li><span>They made also the tunick of the ephod all of
    violet,</span></li>

    <li><span>And a hole for the head in the upper part at the
    middle, and a woven border round about the hole:</span></li>

    <li><span>And beneath at the feet pomegranates of violet,
    purple, scarlet, and fine twisted linen:</span></li>

    <li><span>And little bells of the purest gold, which they put
    between the pomegranates at the bottom of the tunick round
    about:</span></li>

    <li><span>To wit, a bell of gold, and a pomegranate, wherewith
    the high priest went adorned, when he discharged his ministry,
    as the Lord had commanded Moses.</span></li>

    <li><span>They made also fine linen tunicks with woven work for
    Aaron and his sons:</span></li>

    <li><span>And mitres with their little crowns of fine
    linen:</span></li>

    <li><span>And linen breeches of fine linen:</span></li>

    <li><span>And a girdle of fine twisted linen, violet, purple,
    and scarlet twice dyed, of embroidery work, as the Lord had
    commanded Moses.</span></li>

    <li><span>They made also the plate of sacred veneration of the
    purest gold, and they wrote on it with the engraving of a
    lapidary, The Holy of the Lord:</span></li>

    <li><span>And they fastened it to the mitre with a violet
    fillet, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</span></li>

    <li><span>So all the work of the tabernacle and of the roof of
    the testimony was finished: and the children of Israel did all
    things which the Lord had commanded Moses.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they offered the tabernacle and the roof and the
    whole furniture, the rings, the boards, the bars, the pillars,
    and their sockets,</span></li>

    <li><span>The cover of rams' skins dyed red, and the other
    cover of violet skins,</span></li>

    <li><span>The veil, the ark, the bars, the
    propitiatory,</span></li>

    <li><span>The table, with the vessels thereof, and the loaves
    of proposition:</span></li>

    <li><span>The candlestick, the lamps, and the furniture of them
    with the oil:</span></li>

    <li><span>The altar of gold, and the ointment, and the incense
    of spices:</span></li>

    <li><span>And the hanging in the entry of the
    tabernacle:</span></li>

    <li><span>The altar of brass, the grate, the bars, and all the
    vessels thereof: the laver with the foot thereof: the hangings
    of the court, and the pillars with their sockets:</span></li>

    <li><span>The hanging in the entry of the court, and the little
    cords, and the pins thereof. Nothing was wanting of the
    vessels, that were commanded to be made for the ministry of the
    tabernacle, and for the roof of the covenant.</span></li>

    <li><span>The vestments also, which the priests, to wit, Aaron
    and his sons, used in the sanctuary,</span></li>

    <li><span>The children of Israel offered as the Lord had
    commanded.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Moses saw all things finished, he blessed
    them.</span></li>

  <h2><a name="40">Exodus 40</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</span></li>

    <li><span>The first month, the first day of the month, thou
    shalt set up the tabernacle of the testimony,</span></li>

    <li><span>And shalt put the ark in it, and shalt let down the
    veil before it:</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt bring in the table, and set upon it
    the things that are commanded according to the rite. The
    candlestick shall stand with its lamps,</span></li>

    <li><span>And the altar of gold whereon the incense is burnt,
    before the ark of the testimony. Thou shalt put the hanging in
    the entry of the tabernacle,</span></li>

    <li><span>And before it the altar of holocaust:</span></li>

    <li><span>The laver between the altar and the tabernacle, and
    thou shalt fill it with water.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt encompass the court with hangings, and
    the entry thereof.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt take the oil of unction and anoint the
    tabernacle with its vessels, that they may be
    sanctified:</span></li>

    <li><span>The altar of holocaust and all its
    vessels:</span></li>

    <li><span>The laver with its foot: thou shalt consecrate all
    with the oil of unction, that they may be most
    holy.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons to the door
    of the tabernacle of the testimony, and having washed them with
    water,</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou shalt put on them the holy vestments, that they
    may minister to me, and that the unction of them may prosper to
    an everlasting priesthood.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses did all that the Lord had
    commanded.</span></li>

    <li><span>So in the first month of the second year, the first
    day of the month, the tabernacle was set up.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses reared it up, and placed the boards and the
    sockets and the bars, and set up the pillars,</span></li>

    <li><span>And spread the roof over the tabernacle, putting over
    it a cover, as the Lord had commanded.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he put the testimony in the ark, thrusting bars
    underneath, and the oracle above.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when he had brought the ark into the tabernacle,
    he drew the veil before it to fulfil the commandment of the
    Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he set the table in the tabernacle of the
    testimony at the north side without the veil,</span></li>

    <li><span>Setting there in order the loaves of proposition, as
    the Lord had commanded Moses.</span></li>

    <li><span>He set the candlestick also in the tabernacle of the
    testimony over against the table on the south side,</span></li>

    <li><span>Placing the lamps in order, according to the precept
    of the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>He set also the altar of gold under the roof of the
    testimony over against the veil,</span></li>

    <li><span>And burnt upon it the incense of spices, as the Lord
    had commanded Moses.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he put also the hanging in the entry of the
    tabernacle of the testimony,</span></li>

    <li><span>And the altar of holocaust of the entry of the
    testimony, offering the holocaust, and the sacrifices upon it,
    as the Lord had commanded.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he set the laver between the tabernacle of the
    testimony and the altar, filling it with water.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Moses and Aaron, and his sons washed their hands
    and feet,</span></li>

    <li><span>When they went into the tabernacle of the covenant,
    and went to the altar, as the Lord had commanded
    Moses.</span></li>

    <li><span>He set up also the court round about the tabernacle
    and the altar, drawing the hanging in the entry thereof. After
    all things were perfected,</span></li>

    <li><span>The cloud covered the tabernacle of the testimony,
    and the glory of the Lord filled it.</span></li>

    <li><span>Neither could Moses go into the tabernacle of the
    covenant, the cloud covering all things and the majesty of the
    Lord shining, for the cloud had covered all.</span></li>

    <li><span>If at any time the cloud removed from the tabernacle,
    the children of Israel went forward by their
    troops:</span></li>

    <li><span>If it hung over, they remained in the same
    place.</span></li>

    <li><span>For the cloud of the Lord hung over the tabernacle by
    day, and a fire by night, in the sight of all the children of
    Israel throughout all their mansions.</span></li>
