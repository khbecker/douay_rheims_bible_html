<ol>
<li><span>Now it came to pass after the death of Moses the servant
of the Lord, that the Lord spoke to Josue the son of Nun, the
minister of Moses, and said to him:</span></li>
<li><span>Moses my servant is dead: arise, and pass over this
Jordan, thou and thy people with thee, into the land which I will
give to the children of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>I will deliver to you every place that the sole of your
foot shall tread upon, as I have said to Moses.</span></li>
<li><span>From the desert and from Libanus unto the great river
Euphrates, all the land of the Hethites unto the great sea toward
the going; down of the sun, shall be your border.</span></li>
<li><span>No man shall be able to resist you all the days of thy
life: as I have been with Moses, so will I be with thee: I will not
leave thee, nor forsake thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Take courage, and be strong: for thou shalt divide by lot
to this people the land, for which I swore to their fathers, that I
would deliver it to them.</span></li>
<li><span>Take courage therefore, and be very valiant: that thou
mayst observe and do all the law, which Moses my servant hath
commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left,
that thou mayst understand all things which thou dost.</span></li>
<li><span>Let not the book of this law depart from thy mouth: but
thou shalt meditate on it day and night, that thou mayst observe
and do all things that are written in it: then shalt thou direct
thy way, and understand it.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I command thee, take courage, end be strong. Fear
not and be not dismayed: because the Lord thy God is with thee in
all things whatsoever thou shalt go to.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josue commanded the princes of the people, saying:
Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, and
say:</span></li>
<li><span>Prepare you victuals: for after the third day you shall
pass over the Jordan and shall go in to possess the land, which the
Lord your God will give you.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to the Rubenites, and the Gadites, and the
half tribe of Manasses:</span></li>
<li><span>Remember the word, which Moses the servant of the Lord
commanded you, saying: The Lord your God hath given you rest, and
all this land.</span></li>
<li><span>Your wives, and children, and cattle shall remain in the
land which Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan: but pass you
over armed before your brethren, all of you that are strong of
hand, and fight for them,</span></li>
<li><span>Until the Lord give rest to your brethren as he hath
given you, and they also possess the land which the Lord your God
will give them: and so you shall return into the land of your
possession, and you shall dwell in it, which Moses the servant of
the Lord gave you beyond the Jordan, toward the rising of the
sun.</span></li>
<li><span>And they made answer to Josue, and said: All that thou
hast commanded us we will do; and whithersoever thou shalt send us,
we will go.</span></li>
<li><span>As we obeyed Moses in all things, so will we obey thee
also: only be the Lord thy God with thee, as he was with
Moses.</span></li>
<li><span>He that shall gainsay thy mouth, and not obey all thy
words, that thou shalt command him, let him die: only take thou
courage, and do manfully.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="2">Joshua 2</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And Josue the son of Nun sent from Setim two men, to spy
secretly: and said to them: Go, and view the land and the city of
Jericho. n They went and entered into the house of a woman that was
a harlot named Rahab, and lodged with her.</span></li>
<li><span>And it was told the king of Jericho, and was said :
Behold there are men come in hither, by night, of the children of
Israel, to spy the land.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying: Bring
forth the men that came to thee, and are entered into thy house:
for they are spies, and are come to view all the land.</span></li>
<li><span>And the woman taking the men, hid them, and said: I
confess they came to me, but I knew not whence they
were:</span></li>
<li><span>And at the time of shutting the gate in the dark, they
also went out together. I know not whither they are gone: pursue
after them quickly, and you will overtake them.</span></li>
<li><span>But she made the men go up to the top of her house, and
covered them with the stalks of flax, which was there.</span></li>
<li><span>Now they that were sent, pursued after them, by the way
that leadeth to the fords of the Jordan: and as soon as they were
gone out, the gate was presently shut.</span></li>
<li><span>The men that were hidden were not yet asleep, when behold
the woman went up to them, and said:</span></li>
<li><span>the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea at your going
in, when you came out of Egypt: and what things you did to the two
kings of the Amorrhites, that were beyond the Jordan: Sehon and Og
whom you slew.</span></li>
<li><span>I know that the Lord hath given this land to you: for the
dread of you is fallen upon us, and all the inhabitants of the land
have lost all strength.</span></li>
<li><span>We have heard that</span></li>
<li><span>And hearing these things we were affrighted, and our
heart fainted away, neither did there remain any spirit in us at
your coming in: for the Lord your God he is God in heaven above,
and in the earth beneath.</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore swear ye to me by the Lord, that as I have
shewn mercy to you, so you also will shew mercy to my father's
house: and give me a true token,</span></li>
<li><span>That you will save my father and mother, my brethren end
sisters, and all things that are theirs, and deliver our souls from
death.</span></li>
<li><span>They answered her: Be our lives for you unto death, only
if thou betray us not. And when the Lord shall have delivered us
the land, we will shew thee mercy and truth.</span></li>
<li><span>Then she let them down with a cord out of a window: for
her house joined close to the wall.</span></li>
<li><span>And she said to them: Get ye up to the mountains, lest
perhaps they meet you as they return: and there lie ye hid three
days, till they come back, and so you shall go on your
way.</span></li>
<li><span>And they said to her: We shall be blameless of this oath,
which thou hast made us swear:</span></li>
<li><span>If when we come into the land, this scarlet cord be a
sign, and thou tie it in the window, by which thou hast let us
down: and gather together thy father and mother, and brethren and
all thy kindred into thy house.</span></li>
<li><span>Whosoever shall go out of the door of thy house, his
blood shall be upon his own head, and we shall be quit. But the
blood of all that shall be with thee in the house, shall light upon
our head, if any man touch them.</span></li>
<li><span>But if thou wilt betray us, and utter this word abroad,
we shall be quit of this oath which thou hast made us
swear.</span></li>
<li><span>And she answered: As you have spoken, so be it done. And
sending them on their way, she hung the scarlet cord in the
window.</span></li>
<li><span>But they went and came to the mountains, and stayed there
three days till they that pursued them were returned. For having
sought them through all the way, they found them not.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they were gone back into the city, the spies
returned, and came down from the mountain: and passing over the
Jordan, they came to Josue the son of Nun, and told him all that
befel them.</span></li>
<li><span>And said: The Lord hath delivered all this land into our
hands, and all the inhabitants thereof are overthrown with
fear.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="3">Joshua 3</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And Josue rose before daylight, and removed the camp: and
they departed from Setim, and came to the Jordan, he, and all the
children of Israel, and they abode there for three
days.</span></li>
<li><span>After which, the heralds went through the midst of the
camp,</span></li>
<li><span>And began to proclaim: When you shall see the ark of the
covenant of the Lord your God, and the priests of the race of Levi
carrying it, rise you up also, and follow them as they go
before:</span></li>
<li><span>And let there be between you and the ark the space of two
thousand cubits: that you may see it afar off, and know which way
you must go: for you have not gone this way before: and take care
you come not near the ark.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josue said to the people: Be ye sanctified: for to
morrow the Lord will do wonders among you.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to the priests: Take up the ark of the
covenant, and go before the people. And they obeyed his commands,
and took it up and walked before them.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Josue: This day will I begin to
exalt thee before Israel: that they may know that as I was with
Moses, so I am with thee also.</span></li>
<li><span>And do thou command the priests that carry the ark of the
covenant, and say to them: When you shall have entered into part of
the water of the Jordan, stand in it.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josue said to the children of Israel: Come hither and
hear the word of the Lord your God.</span></li>
<li><span>And again he said: By this you shall know that the Lord
the living God is in the midst of you, and that he shall destroy
before your sight the Chanaanite and the Hethite, the Hevite and
the Pherezite, the Gergesite also and the Jebusite, and the
Amorrhite.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the
earth shall go before you into the Jordan.</span></li>
<li><span>Prepare ye twelve men of the tribes of Israel, one of
every tribe.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the priests, that carry the ark of the Lord the
God of the whole earth, shall set the soles of their feet in the
waters of the Jordan, the waters that are beneath shall run down
and go off: and those that come from above, shall stand together
upon a heap.</span></li>
<li><span>So the people went out of their tents, to pass over the
Jordan: and the priests that carried the ark of the covenant. went
on before them.</span></li>
<li><span>And as soon as they came into the Jordan, and their feet
were dipped in part of the water, (now the Jordan, it being harvest
time, had filled the banks of its channel,)</span></li>
<li><span>The waters that came down from above stood in one place,
and swelling up like a mountain, were seen afar off from the city
that is called Adom, to the place of Sarthan: but those that were
beneath, ran down into the sea of the wilderness (which now is
called the Dead Sea) until they wholly failed.</span></li>
<li><span>And the people marched over against Jericho: and the
priests that carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, stood
girded upon the dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, and all the
people passed over through the channel that was dried
up.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="4">Joshua 4</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And when they were passed over, the Lord said to
Josue:</span></li>
<li><span>Choose twelve men, one of every tribe:</span></li>
<li><span>And command them to take out of the midst of the Jordan,
where the feet of the priests stood, twelve very hard stones, which
you shall set in the place of the camp, where you shall pitch your
tents this night.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josue called twelve men, whom he had chosen out of
the children of Israel, one out of every tribe,</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to them: Go before the ark of the Lord your
God to the midst of the Jordan, and carry from thence every man a
stone on your shoulders, according to the number of the children of
Israel,</span></li>
<li><span>That it may be a sign among you end when your children
shall ask you to morrow, saying: What mean these
stones?</span></li>
<li><span>You shall answer them: The waters of the Jordan ran off
before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, when it passed over the
same: therefore were these atones set for a monument of the
children of Israel for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>The children of Israel therefore did as Josue commanded
them, carrying out of the channel of the Jordan twelve stones, as
the Lord had commanded him, according to the number of the children
of Israel, unto the place wherein they camped, and there they set
them.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josue put other twelve stones in the midst of the
channel of the Jordan, where the priests stood that carried the ark
of the covenant: and they are there until this present
day.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the priests that carried the ark, stood in the midst
of the Jordan till all things were accomplished which the Lord had
commanded Josue to speak to the people, and Moses had said to him.
And the people made haste and passed over.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they had all passed over, the ark also of the
Lord passed over, and the priests went before the
people.</span></li>
<li><span>The children of Ruben also and Gad, and half the tribe of
Manasses, went armed before the children of Israel as Moses had
commanded them.</span></li>
<li><span>And forty thousand fighting men by their troops, and
bands, marched through the plains and fields of the city of
Jericho.</span></li>
<li><span>In that day the Lord magnified Josue in the sight of all
Israel, that they should fear him, as they had feared Moses, while
he lived.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to him:</span></li>
<li><span>Command the priests, that carry the ark of the covenant,
to come up out of the Jordan.</span></li>
<li><span>And he commanded them, saying: Come ye up out of the
Jordan.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they that carried the ark of the covenant of the
Lord, were come up, and began to tread on the dry ground, the
waters returned into the channel, and ran as they were wont
before.</span></li>
<li><span>And the people came up out of the Jordan, the tenth day
of the first month, and camped in Galgal, over against the east
side of the city of Jericho.</span></li>
<li><span>And the twelve stones which they had taken out of the
channel of the Jordan, Josue pitched in Galgal,</span></li>
<li><span>And said to the children of Israel: When your children
shall ask their fathers, to morrow, and shall say to them: What
mean these stones?</span></li>
<li><span>You shall teach them and say: Israel passed over this
Jordan through the dry channel.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord your God drying up the waters thereof in your
sight, until you passed over:</span></li>
<li><span>As he had done before in the Red Sea, which he dried up
till we passed through :</span></li>
<li><span>That all the people of the earth may learn the most
mighty hand of the Lord, that you also may fear the Lord your God
for ever.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="5">Joshua 5</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Now when all the kings of the Amorrhites, who dwelt
beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of Chanaan, who
possessed the places near the great sea, had heard that the Lord
had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the children of
Israel, till they passed over, their heart failed them, and there
remained no spirit in them, fearing the coming in of the children
of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>At that time the Lord said to Josue: Make thee knives of
stone, and circumcise the second time the children of
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>He did what the Lord had commanded, and he circumcised
the children of Israel in the hill of the foreskins.</span></li>
<li><span>Now this is the cause of the second circumcision: All the
people that came out of Egypt that were males, all the men fit for
war, died in the desert, during the time of the long going about in
the way.</span></li>
<li><span>Now these were all circumcised. But the people that were
born in the desert,</span></li>
<li><span>Luring the forty years of the journey in the wide
wilderness, were uncircumcised: till all they were consumed that
had not heard the voice of the Lord, and to whom he had sworn
before, that he would not shew them the land flowing with milk and
honey.</span></li>
<li><span>The children of these succeeded in the place of their
fathers, and were circumcised by Josue: for they were uncircumcised
even as they were born, and no one had circumcised them in the
way.</span></li>
<li><span>Now after they were all circumcised, they remained in the
same place of the camp, until they were healed.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Josue: This day have I taken away
from you the reproach of Egypt. And the name of that place was
called Galgal, until this present day.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Israel abode in Galgal, and they kept
the phase on the fourteenth day of the month, at evening, in the
plains of Jericho:</span></li>
<li><span>And they ate on the next day unleavened bread of the corn
of the land, and frumenty of the same year.</span></li>
<li><span>And the manna ceased after they ate of the corn of the
land, neither did the children of Israel use that food any more,
but they ate of the corn of the present year of the land of
Chanaan.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Josue was in the field of the city of Jericho,
he lifted up his eyes, and saw a man standing over against him:
holding a drawn sword, and he went to him, and said: Art thou one
of ours, or of our adversaries?</span></li>
<li><span>And he answered: No: but I am prince of the host of the
Lord, and now I am come.</span></li>
<li><span>Josue fell on his face to the ground. And worshipping,
add: What saith my lord to his servant?</span></li>
<li><span>Loose, saith he, thy shoes from off thy feet: for the
place whereon thou standest is holy. And Josue did as was commanded
him.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="6">Joshua 6</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Now Jericho was close shut up and fenced, for fear of the
children of Israel, and no man durst go out or come in.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Josue: Behold I have given into thy
hands Jericho, and the king thereof, and all the valiant
men.</span></li>
<li><span>Go round about the city, all ye fighting men, once a day:
so shall ye do for six days.</span></li>
<li><span>And on the seventh day the priests shall take the seven
trumpets, which are used in the jubilee, and shall go before the
ark of the covenant: and you shall go about the city seven times,
and the priests shall sound the trumpets.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the voice of the trumpet shall give a longer and
broken tune, and shall sound in your ears, all the people shall
shout together with a very great shout, and the walls of the city
shall fall to the ground, and they shall enter in every one at the
place against which they shall stand.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Josue the son of Nun called the priests, and said to
them: Take the ark of the covenant: and let seven other priests
take the seven trumpets of the jubilee, and march before the ark of
the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to the people: Go, and compass the city,
armed, marching before the ark of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Josue had ended his words, and the seven priests
blew the seven trumpets before the ark of the covenant of the
Lord,</span></li>
<li><span>And all the armed men went before, the rest of the common
people followed the ark, and the sound of the trumpets was heard on
all sides.</span></li>
<li><span>But Josue had commanded the people, saying: You shall not
shout, nor shall your voice be heard, nor any word go out of your
mouth: until the day come wherein I shall say to you: Cry, and
shout.</span></li>
<li><span>So the ark of the Lord went about the city once a day,
and returning into the camp, abode there.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josue rising before day, the priests took the ark of
the Lord,</span></li>
<li><span>And seven of them seven trumpets, which are used in the
jubilee: and they went before the ark of the Lord walking and
sounding the trumpets: and the armed men went before them, and the
rest of the common people followed the ark, and they blew the
trumpets.</span></li>
<li><span>And they went round about the city the second day once,
and returned into the camp. So they did six days.</span></li>
<li><span>But the seventh day, rising up early, they went about the
city, as it was ordered, seven times.</span></li>
<li><span>And when in the seventh going about the priests sounded
with the trumpets, Josue said to all Israel: Shout: for the Lord
hath delivered the city to you:</span></li>
<li><span>And let this city be an anathema, and all things that are
in it, to the Lord. Let only Rahab the harlot live, with all that
are with her in the house: for she hid the messengers whom we
sent.</span></li>
<li><span>But beware ye lest you touch ought of those things that
are forbidden, and you be guilty of transgression, and all the camp
of Israel be under sin, and be troubled.</span></li>
<li><span>But whatsoever gold or silver there shall be, or vessels
of brass and iron, let it be consecrated to the Lord, laid up in
his treasures.</span></li>
<li><span>So all the people making a shout, and the trumpets
sounding, when the voice and the sound thundered in the ears of the
multitude, the walls forth- with fell down: and every man went up
by the place that was over against him: s and they took the
city,</span></li>
<li><span>And killed all that were in it, man and woman, young and
old. The oxen also and the sheep, and the asses, they slew with the
edge of the sword.</span></li>
<li><span>But Josue said to the two men that had been sent for
spies: Go into the harlot's house, and bring her out, and all
things that are hers, as you assured her by oath.</span></li>
<li><span>And the young men went in and brought out Rahab, and her
parents, her brethren also and all her goods and her kindred, and
made them to stay without the camp.</span></li>
<li><span>But they burned the city, and all things that were
therein; except the gold and silver, and vessels of brass and iron,
which they consecrated into the treasury of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>But Josue saved Rahab the harlot and her father's house,
and all she had, and they dwelt in the midst of Israel until this
present day: because she hid the messengers whom he had sent to spy
out Jericho. At that time, Josue made an imprecation,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Cursed be the man before the Lord, that shall raise up
and build the city of Jericho. In his firstborn may he lay the
foundation thereof, and in the last of his children set up its
gates.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord was with Josue, and his name was noised
throughout all the land.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="7">Joshua 7</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>But the children of Israel transgressed the commandment,
and took to their own use of the anathema. For Achan the son of
Charmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zare of the tribe of Juda,
took something of the anathema: and the Lord was angry against the
children of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Josue sent men from Jericho against Hai, which
is beside Bethaven, on the east side of the town of Bethel, he said
to them: Go up, and view the country: and they fulfilled his
command, and viewed Hai.</span></li>
<li><span>And returning they said to him: Let not all the people go
up, but let two or three thousand men go and destroy the city: why
should all the people be troubled in vain against enemies that are
very few?</span></li>
<li><span>There went up therefore three thou- sand fighting men:
who immediately turned their backs,</span></li>
<li><span>And were defeated by the men of the city of Hai, and
there fell of them six and thirty men : and the enemies pursued
them from the gate as far as Sabarim, and they slew them as they
fled by the descent: and the heart of the people was struck with
fear, and melted like water.</span></li>
<li><span>But Josue rent his garments, and fell flat on the ground
before the ark of the Lord until the evening, both he and all the
ancients of Israel: and they put dust upon their heads.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josue said: Alas, O Lord God, why wouldst thou bring
this people over the river Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of
the Amorrhite, and to destroy us? would God, we had stayed beyond
the Jordan as we began.</span></li>
<li><span>My Lord God, what shall I say, seeing Israel turning
their backs to their enemies?</span></li>
<li><span>The Chanaanites, and all the inhabitants of the land will
hear of it, and being gathered together will surround us and cut
off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do to thy great
name?</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Josue: Arise, why liest thou flat on
the ground?</span></li>
<li><span>Israel hath sinned, and transgressed my covenant: and
they have taken of the anathema, and have stolen and lied, and have
hidden it among their goods.</span></li>
<li><span>Neither can Israel stand before his enemies, but he shall
flee from them: because he is defiled with the anathema. I will be
no more with you, till you destroy him that is guilty of this
wickedness.</span></li>
<li><span>Arise, sanctify the people, and say to them: Be ye
sanctified against to morrow: for thus saith the Lord God of
Israel: The anathema is in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst
not stand before thy enemies, till he be destroyed out of thee that
is defiled with this wickedness.</span></li>
<li><span>And you shall come in the morning every one by your
tribes: and what tribe soever the lot shall find, it shall come by
its kindreds and the kindred by its houses, and the house by the
men.</span></li>
<li><span>And whosoever he be that shall be found guilty of this
fact, he shall be burnt with fire with all his substance, because
he hath transgressed the covenant of the Lord, and hath done
wickedness in Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Josue, therefore, when he rose in the morning, made
Israel to come by their tribes, and the tribe of Juda was
found,</span></li>
<li><span>Which being brought by its families, it was found to be
the family of Zare. Bringing that also by the houses, he found it
to be Zabdi.</span></li>
<li><span>And bringing his house man by man, he found Achan the son
of Charmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zare of the tribe of
Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josue said to Achan: My son, give glory to the Lord
God of Israel, and confess, and tell me what thou hast done, hide
it not.</span></li>
<li><span>And Achan answered Josue, and said to him: Indeed I have
sinned against the Lord the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I
done.</span></li>
<li><span>For I saw among the spoils a scarlet garment exceeding
good, and two hundred sides of silver, and a golden rule of fifty
sides: and I coveted them, and I took them away, and hid them in
the ground is the midst of my tent, and the silver I covered with
the earth that I dug up.</span></li>
<li><span>Josue therefore sent ministers: who running to his tent,
found all hidden in the same place, together with the
silver.</span></li>
<li><span>And taking them away out of the tent, they brought them
to Josue, and to all the children of Israel, and threw them down
before the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Josue and all Israel with him took Achan the son of
Zare, and the silver and the garments, and the golden rule, his
sons also and his daughters, his oxen and asses and sheep, the tent
also, and all the goods: and brought them to the valley of
Achor:</span></li>
<li><span>Where Josue said: Because thou hast troubled us, the Lord
trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him: and all things
that were his, were consumed with fire.</span></li>
<li><span>And they gathered together upon him a great heap of
stones, which remaineth until this present day. And the wrath of
the Lord was turned away from them. And the name of that place was
called the Valley of Achor, until this day.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="8">Joshua 8</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Josue: Fear not, nor be thou
dismayed: take with thee all the multitude of fighting men, arise
and go up to the town of Hai. Behold I have delivered into thy hand
the king thereof, and the people, and the city, and the
land.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt do to the city of Hai, and to the king
thereof, as thou hast done to Jericho, and to the king thereof: but
the spoils and all the cattle you shall take for a prey to
yourselves: lay an ambush for the city behind it.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josue arose, and all the army of the fighting men
with him, to go up against Hai: and he sent thirty thousand chosen
valiant men in the night,</span></li>
<li><span>And commanded them, saying: Lay an ambush behind the
city: and go not very far from it: and be ye all ready.</span></li>
<li><span>But I and the rest of the multitude which is with me;
will approach on the contrary side against the city. And when they
shall come out against us, we will flee, and turn our backs, as we
did before:</span></li>
<li><span>Till they pursuing us be drawn farther from the city: for
they will think that we flee as before.</span></li>
<li><span>And whilst we are fleeing, and they pursuing, you shall
arise out of the ambush, and shall destroy the city: and the Lord
your God will deliver it into our hands.</span></li>
<li><span>And when you shall have taken it, set it on fire, and you
shall do all things so as I have commanded.</span></li>
<li><span>And he sent them away, and they went on to the place of
the ambush, and abode between Bethel and Hai, on the west side of
the city of Hai. But Josue stayed that night in the midst of the
people,</span></li>
<li><span>And rising early in the morning, he mustered his
soldiers, and went up with the ancients in the front of the army
environed with the aid of the fighting men.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they were come, and were gone up over against
the city, they stood on the north side of the city, between which
and them there was a valley in the midst.</span></li>
<li><span>And he had chosen five thousand men, and set them to lie
in ambush between Bethel and Hai, on the west side of the same
city:</span></li>
<li><span>But all the rest of the army went in battle array on the
north side, so that the last of that multitude reached to the west
side of the city. So Josue went that night, and stood in the midst
of the valley.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the king of Hai saw this, he made haste in the
morning, and went out with all the army of the city, and set it in
battle array toward the desert, not knowing that there lay an
ambush behind his back.</span></li>
<li><span>But Josue, and all Israel gave back, making as if they
were afraid, and fleeing by the way of the wilderness.</span></li>
<li><span>But they shouting together, and encouraging one another,
pursued them. And when they were come from the city,</span></li>
<li><span>And not one remained in the city of Hai and of Bethel,
that did not pursue after Israel, leaving the towns open as they
had rushed out,</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord said to Josue: Lift up the shield that is in thy
hand, towards the city of Hai, for I will deliver it to
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he had lifted up his shield towards the city,
the ambush that lay hid, rose up immediately: and going to the
city, took it and set it on fire.</span></li>
<li><span>And the men of the city, that pursued after Josue,
looking back and seeing the smoke of the city rise up to heaven,
had no more power to flee this way or that way: especially as they
that had counterfeited flight, end were going toward the
wilderness, turned back most valiantly against them that
pursued.</span></li>
<li><span>So Josue and all Israel seeing that the city was taken,
and that the smoke of the city rose up, returned and slew the men
of Hai.</span></li>
<li><span>And they also that had taken and set the city on fire,
issuing out of the city to meet their own men, began to cut off the
enemies who were surrounded by them. So that the enemies being cut
off on both sides, not one of so great a multitude was
saved.</span></li>
<li><span>And they took the king of the city of Hai alive, and
brought him to Josue.</span></li>
<li><span>So all being slain that had pursued after Israel in his
flight to the wilderness, and tailing by the sword in the same
place, the children of Israel returned and laid waste the
city.</span></li>
<li><span>And the number of them that fell that day, both of men
and women, was twelve thousand persons all of the city of
Hai.</span></li>
<li><span>But Josue drew not back his hand, which he had stretched
out on high, holding the shield, till all the inhabitants of Hai
were slain.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Israel divided among them the cattle
and the prey of the city, as the Lord had commanded
Josue.</span></li>
<li><span>And he burned the city, and made it a heap for
ever:</span></li>
<li><span>And he hung the king thereof on a gibbet until the
evening and the going down of the sun. Then Josue commanded, and
they took down his carcass from the gibbet: and threw it in the
very entrance of the city, heaping upon it a great heap of stones,
which remaineth until this present day.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Josue built an altar to the Lord the God of Israel
in mount Hebal,</span></li>
<li><span>As Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded the
children of Israel, and it is written in the book of the law of
Moses: an altar of unhewn stones which iron had not touched: and he
offered upon it holocausts to the Lord, and immolated victims of
peace offerings.</span></li>
<li><span>And he wrote upon stones the Deuteronomy of the law of
Moses, which he had ordered before the children of
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the people, and the ancients, and the princes and
judges stood on both sides of the ark, before the priests that
carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, both the stranger and
he that was born among them, half of them by mount Garizim, and
half by mount Hebal, as Moses the servant of the Lord had
commanded. And first he blessed the people of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>After this he read all the words of the blessing and the
cursing and all things that were written in the hook of the
law.</span></li>
<li><span>He left out nothing of those things which Moses had
commanded, but he repeated all before all the people of Israel,
with the women and children and strangers that dwelt among
them.</span></li>

<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="9">Joshua 9</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Now When these things were heard of, all the kings beyond
the Jordan, that dwelt in the mountains and in the plains, in the
places near the sea, and on the coasts of the great sea, they also
that dwell by Libanus, the Hethite and the Amorrhite, the
Chanaanite, the Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the
Jebusite,</span></li>
<li><span>Gathered themselves together, to fight against Josue and
Israel with one mind, and one resolution.</span></li>
<li><span>But they that dwelt in Gabaon, hearing all that Josue had
done to Jericho and Hai:</span></li>
<li><span>Cunningly devising took for themselves provisions, laying
old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles rent and sewed up
again,</span></li>
<li><span>And very old shoes, which for a show of age were clouted
with patches, and old garments upon them: the leaves also, which
they carried for provisions by the way, were hard, and broken into
pieces:</span></li>
<li><span>And they went to Josue, who then abode in the camp at
Galgal, and said to him, and to all Israel with him: We are come
from a far country, desiring to make peace with you. And the
children of Israel answered them, and said:</span></li>
<li><span>Perhaps you dwell in the land which falls to our lot; if
so, we can make no league with you.</span></li>
<li><span>But they said to Josue: We are thy servants. Josue said
to them: Who are you? and whence came you?</span></li>
<li><span>They answered: From a very far country thy servants are
come in the name of the Lord thy God. For we have heard the fame of
his power, all the things that he did in Egypt.</span></li>
<li><span>And to the two kings of the Amorrhites that were beyond
the Jordan, Sehon king of Hesebon, and Og king of Basan, that was
in Astaroth:</span></li>
<li><span>And our ancients, and all the inhabitants of our country
said to us: Take with you victuals for a long way, and go meet
them, and say: We are your servants, make ye a league with
us.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold, these leaves we took hot, when we set out from
our houses to come to you, now they are become dry, and broken in
pieces, by being exceeding old.</span></li>
<li><span>These bottles of wine when we filled them were new, now
they are rent and burst. These garments we have on, and the shoes
we have on our feet, by reason of the very long journey are worn
out, and almost consumed.</span></li>
<li><span>They took therefore of their victuals, and consulted not
the mouth of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josue made peace with them, and entering into a
league promised that they should not be slain: the princes also of
the multitude swore to them.</span></li>
<li><span>Now three days after the league was made, they heard that
they dwelt nigh, and they should be among them.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Israel removed the camp, and came
into their cities on the third day, the names of which are Gabaon,
and Caphira, and Beroth, and Cariathiarim.</span></li>
<li><span>And they slew them not, because the princes of the
multitude had sworn in the name of the Lord the God of Israel. Then
all the common people murmured against the princes.</span></li>
<li><span>And they answered them: We have sworn to them in the name
of the Lord the God of Israel, and therefore we may not touch
them.</span></li>
<li><span>But this we mill do to them: Let their lives be saved,
lest the wrath of the Lord be stirred up against us, if we should
be forsworn.</span></li>
<li><span>But so let them live, as to serve the whole multitude in
hewing wood, and bringing in water. As they were speaking these
things,</span></li>
<li><span>Josue called the Gabaonites and said to them: Why would
you impose upon us, saying: We dwell far off from you, whereas you
are in the midst of us?</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore you shall be under a curse, and your race shall
always be hewers of wood, and carriers of water unto the house of
my God.</span></li>
<li><span>They answered: It was told us thy servants, that the Lord
thy God had promised his servant Moses to give you all the land,
and to destroy all the inhabitants thereof. Therefore we feared
exceedingly and provided for our lives. compelled by the dread we
had of you and we took this counsel.</span></li>
<li><span>And now we are in thy hand: deal with us as it seemeth
good and right unto thee.</span></li>
<li><span>So Josue did as he had said, and delivered them from the
hand of the children of Israel, that they should not be
slain.</span></li>
<li><span>And he gave orders in that day that they should be in the
service of all the people, and of the altar of the Lord, hewing
wood and carrying water, until this present time, in the place
which the Lord hath chosen.</span></li>

</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="10">Joshua 10</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>When Adonisedec king of Jerusalem had heard these things,
to wit, that Josue had taken Hai, and had destroyed it, (for as he
had done to Jericho and the king thereof, so did he to Hai, and its
king,) and that the Gabaonites were gone over to Israel, and were
their confederates,</span></li>
<li><span>He was exceedingly afraid. For Gabaon was a great city,
and one of the royal cities, and greater than the town of Hai, and
all its fighting men were most valiant.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore Adonisedec king of Jerusalem sent to Oham king
of Hebron, and to Pharam king of Jerimoth, and to Japhia king of
Lachis, and to Dabir king of Eglon, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Come up to me, and bring help, that we may take Gabaon,
because it hath gone over to Josue, and to the children of
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>So the five kings of the Amorrhites being assembled
together went up: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the
king of Jerimoth, the king of Lachis, the king of Eglon, they and
their armies, and camped about Gabaon, laying siege to
it.</span></li>
<li><span>But the inhabitants of the city of Gabaon which was
besieged, sent to Josue, who then abode in the camp at Galgal, and
said to him: Withdraw not thy hands from helping thy servants: come
up quickly and save us, and bring us succour: for all the kings of
the Amorrhites, who dwell in the mountains, are gathered together
against us.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josue went up from Galgal, and all the army of the
warriors with him, most valiant men.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Josue: Fear them not: for I have
delivered them into thy hands: none of them shall be able to stand
against thee.</span></li>
<li><span>So Josue going up from Galgal all the night, came upon
them suddenly.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord troubled them at the sight of Israel: and he
slew them with a great slaughter in Gabaon, and pursued them by the
way of the ascent to Beth-horon, and cut them off all the way to
Azeca and Maceda.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they were fleeing from the children of Israel,
and were in the descent of Beth-horon, the Lord cast down upon them
great stones from heaven as far as Azeca: and many more were killed
with the hailstones than were slain by the swords of the children
of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Josue spoke to the Lord, in the day that he
delivered the Amorrhite in the sight of the children of Israel, and
he said before them: Move not, O sun, toward Gabaon, nor thou, O
moon, toward the valley of Ajalon.</span></li>
<li><span>And the sun and the moon stood still, till the people
revenged themselves of their enemies. Is not this written in the
book of the just? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven,
and hasted not to go down the space of one day.</span></li>
<li><span>There was not before nor after so long a day, the Lord
obeying the voice of a man, and fighting for Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josue returned with all Israel into the camp of
Galgal.</span></li>
<li><span>For the five kings were fled, and had hidden themselves
in a cave of the city of Maceda.</span></li>
<li><span>And it was told Josue that the five kings were found
hidden in a cave of the city of Maceda.</span></li>
<li><span>And he commanded them that were with him, saying: Roll
great stones to the mouth of the cave, and set careful men, to keep
them shut up:</span></li>
<li><span>And stay you not, but pursue after the enemies, and kill
all the hindermost of them as they flee, and do not suffer them
whom the Lord God hath delivered into your hands to shelter
themselves in their cities.</span></li>
<li><span>So the enemies being slain with a great slaughter, and
almost utterly consumed, they that were able to escape from Israel,
entered into fenced cities.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the army returned to Josue in Maceda, where the
camp then was, in good health and without the loss of any one: and
no man durst move his tongue against the children of
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josue gave orders, saying: Open the mouth of the
cave, and bring forth to me the five kings that lie hid
therein.</span></li>
<li><span>And the ministers did as they were commanded: and they
brought out to him the five kings out of the cave: the king of
Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jerimoth, the king of
Lachis, the king of Eglon.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they were Drought out to him, he called all the
men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the army that were with
him: Go, and set your feet on the necks of these kings. And when
they had gone, and put their feet upon the necks of them lying
under them,</span></li>
<li><span>He said again to them: Fear not, neither be ye dismayed,
take courage and be strong: for so will the Lord do to all your
enemies, against whom you fight.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josue struck, and slew them, and hanged them upon
five gibbets, and they hung until the evening.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the sun was down, he commanded the soldiers to
take them down from the gibbets. And after they were taken down,
they cast them into the cave where they had lain hid, and put great
stones at the mouth thereof, which remain until this
day.</span></li>
<li><span>The same day Josue took Maceda and destroyed it, with the
edge of the sword, and killed the king and all the inhabitants
thereof: he left not in it the least remains. And he did to the
king of Maceda, as he had done to the king of Jericho.</span></li>
<li><span>And he passed from Maceda with all Israel to Lebna, and
fought against it:</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord delivered it with the king thereof into the
hands of Israel: and they destroyed the city with the edge of the
sword, and all the inhabitants thereof. They left not in it any
remains. And they did to the king of Lebna, as they had done to the
king of Jericho.</span></li>
<li><span>From Lebna he passed unto Lachis, with all Israel: and
investing it with his army, besieged it.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord delivered Lachis into the hands of Israel,
and he took it the following day, and put it to the sword, and
every soul that was in it, as he had done to Lebna.</span></li>
<li><span>At that time Horam king of Gazer, came up to succour
Lachis: and Josue slew him with all his people, so as to leave none
alive.</span></li>
<li><span>And he passed from Lachis to Eglon, and surrounded
it,</span></li>
<li><span>And took it the same day: and put to the sword all the
souls that were in it, according to all that he had done to
Lachis.</span></li>
<li><span>He went up also with all Israel from Eglon to Hebron, and
fought against it:</span></li>
<li><span>Took it, and destroyed it with the edge of the sword: the
king also thereof, and all the towns of that country, and all the
souls that dwelt in it: he left not therein any remains: as he had
done to Eglon, so did he also to Hebron, putting to the sword all
that he found in it.</span></li>
<li><span>Returning from thence to Dabir,</span></li>
<li><span>He took it and destroyed it: the king also thereof and
all the towns round about he destroyed with the edge of the sword:
he left not in it any remains: as he had done to Hebron and Lebna
and to their kings, so did he to Dabir and to the king
thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>So Josue conquered all the country of the hills and of
the south and of the plain, and of Asedoth, with their kings: he
left not any remains therein, but slew all that breathed, as the
Lord the God of Israel had commanded him,</span></li>
<li><span>From Cadesbarne even to Gaza. All the land of Gosen even
to Gabaon,</span></li>
<li><span>And all their kings, and their lands he took and wasted
at one onset: for the Lord the God of Israel fought for
him.</span></li>
<li><span>And he returned with all Israel to the place of the camp
in Galgal.</span></li>

<li><span>And when Jabin king of Asor had heard these things, he
sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Semeron, and to the
king of Achsaph:</span></li>
<li><span>And to the kings of the north, that dwelt in the
mountains and in the plains over against the south side of
Ceneroth, and in the levels and the countries of Dor by the sea
side :</span></li>
<li><span>To the Chanaanites also on the ease and on the west, and
the Amorrhite, and the Hethite, and the Pherezite, and the Jebusite
in the mountains: to the Hevite also who dwelt at the foot of
Hermon in the land of Maspha.</span></li>
<li><span>And they all came out with their troops, a people
exceeding numerous as the sand that is on the sea shore, their
horses also and chariots a very great multitude,</span></li>
<li><span>And all these kings assembled together at the waters of
Merom, to fight against Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Josue: Fear them not: for to morrow
at this same hour I will deliver all these to be slain in the sight
of Israel: thou shalt hamstring their horses, and thou shalt burn
their chariots with fire.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josue came, and all the army with him, against them
to the waters of Merom on a sudden, and fell upon them.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord delivered them into the hands of Israel. And
they defeated them, and chased them as far as the great Sidon, and
the waters of Maserophot, and the field of Masphe, which is on the
east side thereof. He slew them all, so as to leave no remains of
them:</span></li>
<li><span>And he did as the Lord had commanded him, he hamstringed
their horses and burned their chariots.</span></li>
<li><span>And presently turning back he took Asor: and slew the
king thereof with the sword. Now Asor of old was the head of all
these kingdoms.</span></li>
<li><span>And he cut off all the souls that abode there: he left
not in it any remains, but utterly destroyed all, and burned the
city itself with fire.</span></li>
<li><span>And he took and put to the sword and destroyed all the
cities round about, and their kings, as Moses the servant of God
had commanded him.</span></li>
<li><span>Except the cities that were on hills and high places, the
rest Israel burned: only Asor that was very strong he consumed with
fire.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Israel divided among themselves all
the spoil of these cities and the cattle, killing all the
men.</span></li>
<li><span>As the Lord had commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses
command Josue, and he accomplished all: he left not one thing
undone of all the commandments which the Lord had commanded
Moses.</span></li>
<li><span>So Josue took all the country of the hills, and of the
south, and the land of Gosen, and the plains and the west country,
and the mountain of Israel, and the plains thereof:</span></li>
<li><span>And part of the mountain that goeth up to Seir as far as
Baalgad, by the plain of Libanus under mount Hermon: all their
kings he took, smote and slew.</span></li>
<li><span>Josue made war a long time against these
kings.</span></li>
<li><span>There was hot a city that delivered itself to the
children of Israel, except the Hevite, who dwelt in Gabaon: for he
took all by fight.</span></li>
<li><span>For it was the sentence of the Lord, that their hearts
should be hardened, and they should fight against Israel, and fall,
and should not deserve any clemency, and should be destroyed as the
Lord had commanded Moses.</span></li>
<li><span>At that time Josue came and cut off the Enacims from the
mountains, from Hebron, and Dabir, and Anab, and from all the
mountain of Juda and Israel, and destroyed their
cities.</span></li>
<li><span>He left not any of the stock of the Enacims, in the land
of the children of Israel: except the cities of Gaza, and Geth, and
Azotus, in which alone they were left.</span></li>
<li><span>So Josue took all the land, as the Lord spoke to Moses,
and delivered it in possession to the children of Israel, according
to their divisions and tribes. And the land rested from
wars.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>Josue was old, and far advanced in years, and the Lord
said to him: Thou art grown old, and advanced in age, and there is
a very large country left, which is not yet divided by
lot:</span></li>
<li><span>To wit, all Galilee, Philistia, and all
Gessuri.</span></li>
<li><span>From the troubled river, that watereth Egypt, unto the
borders of Accaron northward: the land of Chanaan, which is divided
among the lords of the Philistines, the Gazites, the Azotians, the
Ascalonites, the Gethites, and the Accronites.</span></li>
<li><span>And on the south side are the Hevites, all the land of
Chanaan, and Maara of the Sidonians as far as Apheca, and the
borders of the Amorrhite,</span></li>
<li><span>And his confines. The country also of Libanus towards the
east from Baalgad under mount Hermon to the entering into
Emath.</span></li>
<li><span>Of all that dwell in the mountains from Libanus, to the
waters of Maserephoth, and all the Sidonians. I am he that will cut
them off from before the face of the children of Israel. So let
their land come in as a part of the inheritance of Israel, as I
have commanded thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And now divide the land in possession to the nine tribes,
and to the half tribe of Manasses,</span></li>
<li><span>With whom Ruben and Gad have possessed the land, which
Moses the servant of the Lord delivered to them beyond the river
Jordan, on the east side.</span></li>
<li><span>From Aroer, which is upon the bank of the torrent Amen,
and in the midst of the valley and all the plains of Medaba, as far
as Dibon:</span></li>
<li><span>And all the cities of Sehon, king of the Amorrhites, who
reigned in Hesebon, unto the borders of the children of
Ammon.</span></li>
<li><span>And Galaad, and the borders of Gessuri and Machati, and
all mount Hermon, and all Basan as far as Salecha,</span></li>
<li><span>All the kingdom of Og in Basan, who reigned in Astaroth
and Edrai, he was of the remains of the Raphaims: and Moses
overthrew and destroyed them.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Israel would not destroy Gessuri and
Machati: and they have dwelt in the midst of Israel, until this
present day.</span></li>
<li><span>But to the tribe of Levi he gave no possession: but the
sacrifices and victims of the Lord God of Israel, are his
inheritance, as he spoke to him.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses gave a possession to the children of Ruben
according to their kindreds.</span></li>
<li><span>And their border was from Aroer, which is on the bank of
the torrent Arnon, and in the midst of the valley of the same
torrent: all the plain, that leadeth to Medaba,</span></li>
<li><span>And Hesebon, and all their villages, which are in the
plains. Dibon also, and Bamothbaal, and the town of
Baalmaon,</span></li>
<li><span>And Jassa, and Cidimoth, and Mephaath,</span></li>
<li><span>And Cariathaim, and Sabama, and Sarathasar in the
mountain of the valley.</span></li>
<li><span>Bethphogor and Asedoth, Phasga and
Bethiesimoth,</span></li>
<li><span>And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdoms of
Sehon king of the Amorrhites, that reigned in Hesebon, whom Moses
slew with the princes of Madian: Hevi, and Recem, and Sur and Hur,
and Rebe, dukes of Sehon inhabitants of the land.</span></li>
<li><span>Balaam also the son of Beer the soothsayer, the children
of Israel slew with the sword among the rest that were
slain.</span></li>
<li><span>And the river Jordan was the herder of the children of
Ruben. This is the possession of the Rubenites, by their kindreds,
of cities and villages.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses gave to the tribe of Gad and to his children by
their kindreds a possession, of which this is the
division.</span></li>
<li><span>The border of Jaser, and all the cities of Galaad, and
half the land of the children of Ammon: as far as Aroer which is
over against Rabba:</span></li>
<li><span>And from Hesebon unto Ramoth, Masphe and Betonim: and
from Manaim unto the borders of Dabir.</span></li>
<li><span>And in the valley Betharan and Bethnemra, and Socoth, and
Saphon the other part of the kingdom of Sehon king of Hesebon: the
limit of this also is the Jordan, as far as the uttermost part of
the sea of Cenereth beyond the Jordan on the east side.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the possession of the children of Gad by their
families, their cities, and villages.</span></li>
<li><span>He gave also to the half tribe of Manasses and his
children possession according to their kindreds,</span></li>
<li><span>The beginning whereof is this: from Manaim all Basan, and
all the kingdoms of Og king of Basan, and all the villages of Jair,
which are in Basan, threescore towns.</span></li>
<li><span>And half Galaad, and Astaroth, and Edrai, cities of the
kingdom of Og in Basan: to the children of Machir, the son of
Manasses, to one? half of the children of Machir according to their
kindreds.</span></li>
<li><span>This possession Moses divided in the plains of Moab,
beyond the Jordan, over against Jericho on the east
side.</span></li>
<li><span>But to the tribe of Levi he gave no possession: because
the Lord the God of Israel himself is their possession, as he spoke
to them.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="14">Joshua 14</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>This is what the children of Israel possessed in the land
of Chanaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Josue the son of Nun, and
the princes of the families by the tribes of Israel gave to
them:</span></li>
<li><span>Dividing all by lot, as the Lord had commanded by the
hand of Moses, to the nine tribes, and the half tribe.</span></li>
<li><span>For to two tribes and a half Moses had given possession
beyond the Jordan: besides the Levites, who received no land among
their brethren:</span></li>
<li><span>But in their place succeeded the children of Joseph
divided into two tribes, of Manasses and Ephraim: neither did the
Levites receive other portion of land, but cities to dwell in, and
their suburbs to feed their beasts and flocks.</span></li>
<li><span>As the Lord had commanded Moses, so did the children of
Israel, and they divided the land.</span></li>
<li><span>Then the children of Juda came to Josue in Galgal, and
Caleb the son of Jephone the Cenezite spoke to him: Thou knowest
what the Lord spoke to Moses the man of God concerning me and thee
in Cadesbarne.</span></li>
<li><span>I was forty Bears old when Moses the servant of the Lord
sent me m from Cadesbarne, to view the land, and I brought him word
again as to me seemed true.</span></li>
<li><span>But my brethren, that had gone up with me, discouraged
the heart of the people: and I nevertheless followed the Lord my
God.</span></li>
<li><span>And Moses swore in that day, saying: The land which thy
foot hath trodden upon shall be thy possession, and thy children's
for ever, because thou hast followed the Lord my God.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord therefore hath granted me life, as he promised
until this present day. It is forty and five years since the Lord
spoke this word to Moses, when Israel journeyed through the
wilderness: this day I am eighty-five years old,</span></li>
<li><span>As strong as I was at that time when I was sent to view
the land : the strength of that time continueth in me until this
day, as well to fight as to march.</span></li>
<li><span>Give me therefore this mountain, which the Lord promised,
in thy hearing also, wherein are the Enacims, and cities great and
strong: if so be the Lord will be with me, and I shall be able to
destroy them, as he promised me.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josue blessed him, and gave him Hebron in
possession.</span></li>
<li><span>And from that time Hebron belonged to Caleb the son of
Jephone the Cenezite, until this present day: because he followed
the Lord the God of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>The name of Hebron before was called Cariath-Arbe: Adam
the greatest among the Enacims was laid there: and the land rested
from wars.</span></li>

<li><span>Now the lot of the children of Juda by their kindreds was
this: From the frontier of Edom, to the desert of Sin southward,
and to the uttermost part of the south coast.</span></li>
<li><span>Its beginning was from the top of the most salt sea, and
from the bay thereof, that looketh to the south.</span></li>
<li><span>And it goeth out towards the ascent of the Scorpion, and
passeth on to Sina: and ascendeth into Cadesbarne, and reacheth
into Esron, going up to Addar, and compassing Carcaa.</span></li>
<li><span>And from thence passing along into Asemona, and reaching
the torrent of Egypt: and the bounds thereof shall be the great
sea, this shall be the limit of the south coast.</span></li>
<li><span>But on the east side the beginning shall be the most salt
sea even to the end of the Jordan: and towards the north, from the
bay of the sea unto the same river Jordan.</span></li>
<li><span>And the border goeth up into Beth-Hagla, and passeth by
the north into Beth-Araba: going up to the stone of Boen the son of
Ruben.</span></li>
<li><span>And reaching as far as the borders of Debara from the
valley of Achor, and so northward looking towards Galgal, which is
opposite to the ascent of Adommin, on the south side of the
torrent: and the border passeth the waters that are called the
fountain of the sun: and the goings out thereof shall be at the
fountain Rogel.</span></li>
<li><span>And it goeth up by the valley of the son of Ennom on the
side of the Jebusite towards the south, the same is Jerusalem: and
thence ascending to the top of the mountain, which is over against
Geennom to the west in the end of the valley of Raphaim,
northward.</span></li>
<li><span>And it passeth on from the top of the mountain to the
fountain of the water of Nephtoa: and reacheth to the towns of
mount Ephron: and it bendeth towards Baala, which is Cariathiarim,
that is to say, the city of the woods.</span></li>
<li><span>And it compasseth from Baala westward unto mount Seir:
and passeth by the side of mount Jarim to the north into Cheslon:
and goeth down into Bethsames, and passeth into Thamna.</span></li>
<li><span>And it reacheth northward to a part of Accaron at the
side: and bendeth to Sechrona, and passeth mount Baala: and cometh
into Jebneel, and is bounded westward with the great
sea.</span></li>
<li><span>These are the borders round about of the children of Juda
in their kindreds.</span></li>
<li><span>But to Caleb the son of Jephone he gave a portion in the
midst of the children of Juda, as the Lord had commanded him:
Cariath-Arbe the father of Enac. which is Hebron.</span></li>
<li><span>And Caleb destroyed out of it the three sons of Ehac,
Sesai and Ahiman. and Tholmai of the race of Enac.</span></li>
<li><span>And going up from thence he came to the inhabitants of
Dabir, which before was called Cariath-Sepher, that is to say, the
city of letters.</span></li>
<li><span>And Caleb said: He that shall smite Cariath-Sepher, and
take it, I will give him Axa my daughter to wife.</span></li>
<li><span>And Othoniel the son of Cenez, the younger brother of
Caleb, took it: and he gave him Axa his daughter to
wife.</span></li>
<li><span>And as they were going together, she was moved by her
husband to ask a field of her father, and she sighed as she sat on
her ass. And Caleb said to her: What aileth thee?</span></li>
<li><span>But she answered: Give me a blessing: thou hast given me
a southern and dry land, give me also a land that is watered. And
Caleb gave her the upper and the nether watery ground.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the possession of the tribe of the children of
Juda by their kindreds.</span></li>

<li><span>And the lot of the sons of Joseph fell from the Jordan

wilderness which goeth up from Jericho to the mountain of
Bethel:</span></li>
<li><span>And goeth out from Bethel to Luza: and passeth the border
of Archi, to Ataroth,</span></li>
<li><span>And goeth down westward, by the border of Jephleti, unto
the borders of Beth-horon the nether, and to Gazer :and the
countries of it are ended by the great sea:</span></li>

Ataroth-addar unto Beth-horon the upper.</span></li>

<li><span>And this lot fell to the tribe of Manasses (for he is the
firstborn of Joseph) to Machir the firstborn of Manasses the father
of Galaad, who was a warlike man, and had for possession Galaad and
Basan.</span></li>
<li><span>And to the rest of the children of Manasses according to
their families: to the children of Abiezer, and to the children of
Helec, and to the children of Esriel, and to the children of
Sechem, and to the children of Hepher, and to the children of

<li><span>But Salphaad the son of Hepher the son of Galaad the son
of Machir the son of Manasses had no sons, but only daughters:
whose names are these, Maala and Noa and Hegla and Melcha and
Thersa.</span></li>
<li><span>And they came in the presence of Eleazar the priest and
of Josue the son of Nun, and of the princes, saying: The Lord
commanded by the hand of Moses, that a possession should be given
us in the midst of our brethren. And he gave them according to the
commandment of the Lord a possession amongst the brethren of their
father.</span></li>
<li><span>And there fell ten portions to Manasses, beside the land
of Galaad and Basan beyond the Jordan.</span></li>
<li><span>For the daughters of Manasses possessed inheritance in
the midst of his sons. And the land of Galaad fell to the lot of
the rest of the children of Manasses.</span></li>
<li><span>And the border of Manasses was from Aser, Machmethath
which looketh towards Sichem: and it goeth out on the right hand by
the inhabitants of the fountain of Taphua.</span></li>
<li><span>For the lot of Manasses took in the land of Taphua, which
is on the borders of Manasses, and belongs to the children of
Ephraim.</span></li>
<li><span>And the border goeth down to the valley of the reeds, to
the south of the torrent of the cities of Ephraim, which are in the
midst of the cities of Manasses: the border of Manasses is on the
north side of the torrent, and the outgoings of it are at the
sea:</span></li>
<li><span>So that the possession of Ephraim is on the south, and on
the north that of Manasses, and the sea is the border of both, and
they are joined together in the tribe of Aser on the north, and in
the tribe of Issachar on the east.</span></li>
<li><span>And the inheritance of Manasses in Issachar and in Aser,
was Bethsan and its villages, and Jeblaam with its villages, and
the inhabitants of Dor, with the towns thereof: the inhabitants
also of Endor with the villages thereof: and in like manner the
inhabitants of Thenac with the villages thereof: and the
inhabitants of Mageddo with their villages, and the third part of
the city of Nopheth.</span></li>
<li><span>Neither could the children of Manasses overthrow these
cities, but the Chanaanite began to dwell in his land.</span></li>
<li><span>But after that the children of Israel were grown strong,
they subdued the Chanaanites, and made them their tributaries, and
they did not kill them.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Joseph spoke to Josue, and said: Why
hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to possess, whereas
I am of so great a multitude, and the Lord hath blessed
me?</span></li>
<li><span>And Josue said to them: If thou be a great people, go up
into the woodland, and cut down room for thyself in the land of the
Pherezite and the Raphaims: because the possession of mount Ephraim
is too narrow for thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Joseph answered him: We cannot go up
to the mountains, for the Chanaanites that dwell in the low lands,
wherein are situate Bethsan with its towns, and Jezrael in the
midst of the valley, have chariots of iron</span></li>
<li><span>And Josue said to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and
Manasses: Thou art a great people, and of great strength, thou
shalt not have one lot only:</span></li>
<li><span>But thou shalt pass to the mountain, and shalt cut down
the wood, and make thyself room to dwell in: and mayst proceed
farther, when thou hast destroyed the Chanaanites, who as thou

<li><span>And all the children of Israel assembled together in
Silo, and there they set up the tabernacle of the testimony, and
the land was subdued before them.</span></li>
<li><span>But there remained seven tribes of the children of
Israel, which as yet had not received their
possessions.</span></li>
<li><span>And their cities were, Jericho and Bethhagla and
Vale-Casis,</span></li>
<li><span>And Josue said to them: How long are you indolent and
slack, and go not in to possess the land which the Lord the God of
your fathers hath given you?</span></li>
<li><span>Choose of every tribe three men, that I may send them,
and they may go and compass the land, and mark it out according to
the number of each multitude: and bring back to me what they have
marked out.</span></li>
<li><span>Divide to yourselves the land into seven parts: let Juda
be in his bounds on the south side, and the house of Joseph on the
north.</span></li>
<li><span>The land in the midst between these mark ye out into
seven parts; and you shall come hither to me, that I may cast lots
for you before the Lord your God.</span></li>
<li><span>For the Levites have no part among you, but the
priesthood of the Lord is their inheritance. And Gad and Ruben, and
the half tribe of Manasses have already received their possessions
beyond the Jordan eastward: which Moses the servant of the Lord
gave them.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the men were risen up, to go to mark out the
land, Josue commanded them, saying: Go round the land and mark it
out, and return to me: that I may cast lots for you before the Lord
in Silo.</span></li>
<li><span>So they went: and surveying it divided it into seven
parts, writing them down in a book. And they returned to Josue, to
the camp in Silo.</span></li>
<li><span>And he cast lots before the Lord in Silo, and divided the
land to the children of Israel into seven parts.</span></li>
<li><span>And first came up the lot of the children of Benjamin by
their families, to possess the land between the children of Juda,
and the children of Joseph.</span></li>
<li><span>And their border northward was from the Jordan: going
along by the side of Jericho on the north side, and thence going up
westward to the mountains, and reaching to the wilderness of
Bethaven,</span></li>
<li><span>And passing along southward by Luza, the same is Bethel:
and it goeth down into Ataroth-addar to the mountain, that is on
the south of the nether Beth-horon.</span></li>
<li><span>And it bendeth thence going round towards the sea, south
of the mountain that looketh towards Beth-horon to the southwest:
and the outgoings thereof are into Cariathbaal, which is called
also Cariathiarim, a city of the children of Juda. This is their
coast towards the sea, westward.</span></li>
<li><span>But on the south side the border goeth out from part of

Beer Ramath to the south quarter. This is the inheritance of the
children of Simeon according to their kindreds,</span></li>
<li><span>In the possession and lot of the children of Juda:
because it was too great, and therefore the children of Simeon had
their possession in the midst of their inheritance.</span></li>

portion of Achziba:</span></li>

<li><span>This is the possession of the children of Aser by their
kindreds, and the cities and their villages.</span></li>
<li><span>The sixth lot came out to the sons of Nephtali by their
families:</span></li>
<li><span>And the border began from Heleph and Elon to Saananim,
and Adami, which is Neceb, and Jebnael even to Lecum: and their
outgoings unto the Jordan:</span></li>
<li><span>And the border returneth westward to Azanotthabor, and
goeth out from thence to Hucuca, and passeth along to Zabulon
southward, and to Aser westward, and to Juda upon the Jordan
towards the rising of the sun.</span></li>

and fought against Lesem, and took it: and they put it to the
sword, and possessed it, and dwelt in it, calling the name of it
Lesem Dan, by the name of Dan their father.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the possession of the tribe of the sons of Dan,
by their kindreds, the cities and their villages.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he had made an end of dividing the land by lot
to each one by their tribes, the children of Israel gave a
possession to Josue the son of Nun in the midst of
them,</span></li>
<li><span>According to the commandment of the Lord, the city which
he asked for, Thamnath Saraa, in mount Ephraim: and he built up the
city, and dwelt in it.</span></li>
<li><span>These are the possessions which Eleazar the priest, and
Josue the son of Nun, and the princes of the families, and of the
tribes of the children of Israel, distributed by lot in Silo,

<li><span>At the same time Josue called the Rubenites, and the
Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasses,</span></li>
<li><span>And said to them: You have done all that Moses the
servant of the Lord commanded you: you have also obeyed me in all
things,</span></li>
<li><span>Neither have you left your brethren this long time, until
this present day, keeping the commandment of the Lord your
God.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore as the Lord your God hath given your brethren
rest and peace, as he promised: return, and go to your dwellings,
and to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the
Lord gave you beyond the Jordan:</span></li>
<li><span>Yet so that you observe attentively, and in work fulfil
the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the Lord
commanded you: that you love the Lord your God, and walk in all his
ways, and keep all his commandments, and cleave to him, and serve
him with all your heart, and with all your soul.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josue blessed them, and sent them away, and they
returned to their dwellings.</span></li>
<li><span>Now to half the tribe of Manasses, Moses had given a
possession in Basan: and therefore to the half that remained, Josue
gave a lot among the rest of their brethren beyond the Jordan to
the west. And when he sent them away to their dwellings and had
blessed them,</span></li>
<li><span>He said to them : With much substance and riches, you
return to your settlements, with silver and gold, brass and iron,
and variety of raiment: divide the prey of your enemies with your
brethren.</span></li>
<li><span>So the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and
the half tribe of Manasses returned, and parted from the children
of Israel in Silo, which is in Chanaan, to go into Galaad the land
of their possession, which they had obtained according to the
commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they were come to the banks of the Jordan, in
the land of Chanaan, they built an altar immensely great near the
Jordan.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the children of Israel had heard of it, and
certain messengers had brought them an account that the children of
Ruben, and of Cad, and the half tribe of Manasses had built an
altar in the land of Chanaan, upon the banks of the Jordan, over
against the children of Israel:</span></li>
<li><span>They all assembled in Silo, to go up and fight against
them.</span></li>
<li><span>And in the mean time they sent to them into the land of
Galaad, Phinees the son of Eleazar the priest,</span></li>
<li><span>And ten princes with him, one of every tribe.</span></li>
<li><span>Who came to the children of Ruben, and of Gad, and the
half tribe of Manasses, into the land of Galaad, and said to
them:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith all the people of the Lord: What meaneth this
transgression? Why have you forsaken the Lord the God of Israel,
building a sacrilegious altar, and revolting from the worship of
him?</span></li>
<li><span>Is it a small thing to you that you sinned with
Beelphegor, and the stain of that crime remaineth in us to this
day? and many of the people perished.</span></li>
<li><span>And you have forsaken the Lord to day, and to morrow his
wrath will rage against all Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>But if you think the land of your possession to be
unclean, pass over to the land wherein is the tabernacle of the
Lord, and dwell among us: only depart not from the Lord, and from
our society, by building an altar beside the altar of the Lord our
God.</span></li>
<li><span>Did not Achan the son of Zare transgress the commandment
of the Lord, and his wrath lay upon all the people of Israel? And
he was but one man, and would to God he alone had perished in his
wickedness.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Ruben, and of Gad, and of the half
tribe of Manasses answered the princes of the embassage of
Israel:</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord the most mighty God, the Lord the most mighty
God, he knoweth, and Israel also shall understand: If with the
design of transgression we have set up this altar, let him not save
us, but punish us immediately:</span></li>
<li><span>And if we did it with that mind, that we might lay upon
it holocausts, and sacrifice, and victims of peace offerings, let
him require and judge:</span></li>
<li><span>And not rather with this thought and design, that we
should say: To morrow your children will say to our children: What
have you to do with the Lord the God of Israel?</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord hath put the river Jordan for a border between
us and you, O ye children of Ruben, and ye children of Gad: and
therefore you have no part in the Lord. And by this occasion you
children shall turn away our children from the fear of the Lord. We
therefore thought, it best,</span></li>
<li><span>And said: Let us build us an altar, not for holocausts,
nor to offer victims,</span></li>
<li><span>But for a testimony between us and you, and our posterity
and yours, that we may serve the Lord, and that we may have a right
to offer both holocausts, and victims and sacrifices of peace
offerings: and that your children to morrow may not say to our
children: You have no part in the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And if they will say so, they shall answer them: Behold
the altar of the Lord, which our fathers made, not for holocausts,
nor for sacrifice, but for a testimony between us and
you.</span></li>
<li><span>God keep us from any such wickedness that we should
revolt from the Lord, and leave off following his steps, by
building an altar to offer holocausts, and sacrifices, and victims,
beside the altar of the Lord our God, which is erected before his
tabernacle.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Phinees the priest, and the princes of the
embassage, who were with him, had heard this, they were satisfied:
and they admitted most willingly the words of the children of
Ruben, and Gad, and of the half tribe of Manasses.</span></li>
<li><span>And Phinees the priest the son of Eleazar said to them:
Now we know that the Lord is with us, because you are not guilty of
this revolt, and you have delivered the children of Israel from the
hand of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And he returned with the princes from the children of
Ruben and Gad, out of the land of Galaad, into the land of Chanaan,
to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.</span></li>
<li><span>And the saying pleased all that heard it. And the
children of Israel praised God, and they no longer said that they
would go up against them, and fight, and destroy the land of their
possession.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Ruben, and the children of Cad called
the altar which they had built, Our testimony, that the Lord is
God.</span></li>

excellent land, which he hath given you.</span></li>

the Lord promised to perform for you, not one hath
failed.</span></li>

and all things prosperous have come: so Will he bring upon you all
the evils he hath threatened, till he take you away and destroy you

<li><span>And I would not hear him, but on the contrary I blessed
you by him, and I delivered you out of his hand.</span></li>
<li><span>And you passed over the Jordan, and you came to Jericho.
And the men of that city fought against you, the Amorrhite, and the
Pherezite, and the Chanaanite, and the Hethite, and the Gergesite,
and the Hevite, and the Jebusite: and I delivered them into your
hands.</span></li>
<li><span>And I sent before you hornets: and I drove them out from
their places, the two kings of the Amorrhites, not with thy sword
nor with thy bow.</span></li>
<li><span>And I gave you a land, in which you had not laboured, and
cities to dwell in which you built not, vineyards and oliveyards,
which you planted not.</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore fear the Lord, and serve him with a perfect
and most sincere heart: and put away the gods which your fathers
served in Mesopotamia and in Egypt, and serve the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>But if it seem evil to you to serve the Lord, you have
your choice: choose this day that which pleaseth you, whom you
would rather serve, whether the gods which your fathers served in
Mesopotamia, or the gods of the Amorrhites, in whose land you
dwell: but as for me and my house we will serve the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And the people answered, and said: God forbid we should
leave the Lord, and serve strange gods.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord our God he brought us and our fathers out of the
land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage: and did very great
signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way by which we
journeyed, and among all the people through whom we
passed.</span></li>
<li><span>And he hath cast out all the nations, the Amorrhite the
inhabitant of the land into which we are come. Therefore we will
serve the Lord, for he is our God.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josue said to the people: You will not be able to
serve the Lord: for he is a holy God, and mighty and jealous, and
will not forgive your wickedness and sins.</span></li>
<li><span>If you leave the Lord, and serve strange gods, he will
turn, and will afflict you, and will destroy you after all the good
he hath done you.</span></li>
<li><span>And the people said to Josue: No, it shall not be so as
thou sayest, but we will serve the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And Josue said to the people: You are witnesses, that you
yourselves have chosen you the Lord to serve him. And they
answered: We are witnesses.</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore, said he, put away strange gods from among
you, and incline your hearts to the Lord the God of
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And the people said to Josue: We will serve the Lord our
God, and we will be obedient to his commandments.</span></li>
<li><span>Josue therefore on that day made a covenant, and set
before the people commandments and judgments in Sichem.</span></li>
<li><span>And he wrote all these things in the volume of the law of
the Lord: and he took a great stone, and set it under the oak that
was in the sanctuary of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to all the people: Behold this stone shall be
a testimony unto you, that it hath heard all the words of the Lord,
which he hath spoken to you: lest perhaps hereafter you will deny
it, and lie to the Lord your God.</span></li>
<li><span>And he sent the people away every one to their own
possession.</span></li>
<li><span>And after these things Josue the son of Null the servant
of the Lord died, being a hundred and ten years old:</span></li>
<li><span>And they buried him in the border of his possession in
Thamnathsare, which is situate in mount Ephraim, on the north side
of mount Gaas.</span></li>
<li><span>And Israel served the Lord all the days of Josue, and of
the ancients that lived a long time after Josue, and that had known
all the works of the Lord which he had done in Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And the bones of Joseph which the children of Israel had
taken out of Egypt, they buried in Sichem, in that part of the
field which Jacob had bought of the sons of Hemor the father of
Sichem, for a hundred young ewes, and it was in the possession of
the sons of Joseph.</span></li>
<li><span>Eleazar also the son of Aaron died: and they buried him
in Gabaath that belongeth to Phinees his son, which was given him
in mount Ephraim.</span></li>
