<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="1">1 Samuel 1</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>There was a man of Ramathaimsophim, of mount Ephraim, and
his name was Elcana, the son of Jeroham, the son of Eliu, the son
of Thohu, the son of Suph, an Ephraimite:</span></li>
<li><span>And he had two wives, the name of one was Anna, and the
name of the other Phenenna. Phenenna had children: but Anna had no
children.</span></li>
<li><span>And this man went up out of his city upon the appointed
days, to adore and to offer sacrifice to the Lord of hosts in Silo.
And the two sons of Heli, Ophni and Phinees, were there priests of
the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the day came, and Elcana offered sacrifice, and gave
to Phenenna his wife, and to all her sons and daughters,
portions:</span></li>
<li><span>But to Anna he gave one portion with sorrow, because he
loved Anna. And the Lord had shut up her womb.</span></li>
<li><span>Her rival also afflicted her, and troubled her
exceedingly, insomuch that she upbraided her, that the Lord had
shut up her womb:</span></li>
<li><span>And thus she did every year, when the time returned that
they went up to the temple of the Lord: and thus she provoked her:
but Anna wept, and did not eat.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Elcana her husband said to her: Anna, why weepest
thou? and why dost thou not eat? And why dost thou afflict thy
heart? Am not I better to thee than ten children?</span></li>
<li><span>So Anna arose after she had eaten and drunk in Silo: And
Heli the priest sitting upon a stool, before the door of the temple
of the Lord:</span></li>
<li><span>As Anna had her heart full of grief, she prayed to the
Lord, shedding many tears,</span></li>
<li><span>And she made a vow, saying: O Lord, of hosts, if thou
wilt look down on the affliction of thy servant, and wilt be
mindful of me, and not forget thy handmaid, and wilt give to thy
servant a man child: I will give him to the Lord all the days of
his life, and no razor shall come upon his head.</span></li>
<li><span>And it came to pass, as she multiplied prayers before the
Lord, that Heli observed her mouth.</span></li>
<li><span>Now Anna spoke in her heart, and only her lips moved, but
her voice was not heard at all. Heli therefore thought her to be
drunk,</span></li>
<li><span>And said to her: How long wilt thou, be drunk? digest a
little the wine, of which thou hast taken too much.</span></li>
<li><span>Anna answering, said: Not so, my lord: for I am an
exceeding unhappy woman, and have drunk neither wine nor any strong
drink, but I have poured out my soul before the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Count not thy handmaid for one of the daughters of
Belial: for out of the abundance of my sorrow and grief have I
spoken till now.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Heli said to her: Go in peace: and the God of Israel
grant thee thy petition, which thou hast asked of him.</span></li>
<li><span>And she said: Would to God thy handmaid may find grace in
thy eyes. So the woman went on her way, and ate, and her
countenance was no more changed.</span></li>
<li><span>And they rose in the morning, and worshipped before the
Lord: and they returned, and came into their house at Ramatha. And
Elcana knew Anna his wife: and the Lord remembered her.</span></li>
<li><span>And it came to pass when the time was come about, Anna
conceived and bore a son, and called his name Samuel: because she
had asked him of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And Elcana her husband went up, and all his house, to
offer to the Lord the solemn sacrifice, and his vow.</span></li>
<li><span>But Anna went not up: for she said to her husband: I will
not go till the child be weaned, and till I may carry him, that he
may appear before the Lord, and may abide always there.</span></li>
<li><span>And Elcana her husband said to her: Do what seemeth good
to thee, and stay till thou wean him: and I pray that the Lord may
fulfil his word. So the woman stayed at home, and gave her son
suck, till she weaned him.</span></li>
<li><span>And after she had weaned him, she carried him with her,
with three calves, and three bushels of flour, and a bottle of
wine, and she brought him to the house of the Lord in Silo. Now the
child was as yet very young:</span></li>
<li><span>And they immolated a calf, and offered the child to
Heli.</span></li>
<li><span>And Anna said: I beseech thee, my lord, as thy soul
liveth, my lord: I am that woman who stood before thee here praying
to the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>For this child did I pray, and the Lord hath granted me
my petition, which I asked of him.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore I also have lent him to the Lord all the days
of his life, he shall be lent to the Lord. And they adored the Lord
there. And Anna prayed, and said:</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="2">1 Samuel 2</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>My heart hath rejoiced in the Lord, and my horn is
exalted in my God: my mouth is enlarged over my enemies: because I
have joyed in thy salvation.</span></li>
<li><span>There is none holy as the Lord is: for there is no other
beside thee, and there is none strong like our God.</span></li>
<li><span>Do not multiply to speak lofty things, boasting: let old
matters depart from your mouth: for the Lord is a God of all
knowledge, and to him are thoughts prepared.</span></li>
<li><span>The bow of the mighty is overcome, and the weak are girt
with strength.</span></li>
<li><span>They that were full before have hired out themselves for
bread: and the hungry are filled, so that the barren hath borne
many: and she that had many children is weakened.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord killeth and maketh alive, he bringeth down to
hell and bringeth back again.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord maketh poor and maketh rich, he humbleth and he
exalteth.</span></li>
<li><span>He raiseth up the needy from the dust, and lifteth up the
poor from the dunghill: that he may sit with princes, and hold the
throne of glory. For the poles of the earth are the Lord's, and
upon them he hath set the world.</span></li>
<li><span>He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall
be silent in darkness, because no man shall prevail by his own
strength.</span></li>
<li><span>The adversaries of the Lord shall fear him: and upon them
shall he thunder in the heavens. The Lord shall judge the ends of
the earth, and he shall give empire to his king, and shall exalt
the horn of his Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>And Elcana went to Ramatha, to his house: but the child
ministered in the sight of the Lord before the face of Heli the
priest.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the sons of Heli were children of Belial, not knowing
the Lord,</span></li>
<li><span>Nor the office of the priests to the people: but
whosoever had offered a sacrifice, the servant of the priest came,
while the flesh was in boiling, with a fleshhook of three teeth in
his hand,</span></li>
<li><span>And thrust it into the kettle, or into the caldron, or
into the pot, or into the pan: and all that the fleshhook brought
up, the priest took to himself. Thus did they to all Israel that
came to Silo.</span></li>
<li><span>Also before they burnt the fat, the servant of the priest
came, and said to the man that sacrificed: Give me flesh to boil
for the priest: for I will not take of thee sodden flesh, but
raw.</span></li>
<li><span>And he that sacrificed said to him: Let the fat first be
burnt to day according to the custom, and then take as much as thy
soul desireth. But he answered and said to him: Not so: but thou
shalt give it me now, or else I will take it by force.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore the sin of the young men was exceeding great
before the Lord: because they withdrew men from the sacrifice of
the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>But Samuel ministered before the face of the Lord: being
a child girded with a linen ephod.</span></li>
<li><span>And his mother made him a little coat, which she brought
to him on the appointed days, when she went up with her husband, to
offer the solemn sacrifice.</span></li>
<li><span>And Heli blessed Elcana and his wife: and he said to him:
The Lord give thee seed of this woman, for the loan thou hast lent
to the Lord. And they went to their own home.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord visited Anna, and she conceived, and bore
three sons and two daughters: and the child Samuel became great
before the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Now Heli was very old, and he heard all that his sons did
to all Israel: and how they lay with the women that waited at the
door of the tabernacle:</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to them: Why do ye these kinds of things,
which I hear, very wicked things, from all the people?</span></li>
<li><span>Do not so, my sons: for it is no good report that I hear,
that you make the people of the Lord to transgress.</span></li>
<li><span>If one man shall sin against another, God may be appeased
in his behalf: but if a man shall sin against the Lord, who shall
pray for him? And they hearkened not to the voice of their father,
because the Lord would slay them.</span></li>
<li><span>But the child Samuel advanced, and grew on, and pleased
both the Lord and men.</span></li>
<li><span>And there came a man of God to Heli, and said to him:
Thus saith the Lord: Did I not plainly appear to thy father's
house, when they were in Egypt in the house of Pharao?</span></li>
<li><span>And I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my
priest, to go up to my sitar, and burn incense to me, and to wear
the ephod before me: and I gave to thy father's house of all the
sacrifices of the children of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Why have you kicked away my victims, and my gifts which I
commanded to be offered in the temple: and thou hast rather
honoured thy sons than me, to eat the firstfruits of every
sacrifice of my people Israel?</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: I said
indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father should minister
in my sight, for ever. But now saith the Lord: Far be this from me:
but whosoever shall glorify me, him will I glorify: but they that
despise me, shall be despised.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold the days come: and I will cut off thy arm, and the
arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in
thy house.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt see thy rival in the temple, in all the
prosperity of Israel, and there shall not be an old man in thy
house for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>However I will not altogether take away a man of thee
from my altar: but that thy eyes may faint and thy soul be spent:
and a great part of thy house shall die when they come to man's
estate.</span></li>
<li><span>And this shall be a sign to thee, that shall come upon
thy two sons, Ophni and Phinees: In one day they shall both of them
die.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will raise me up a faithful priest, who shall do
according to my heart, and my soul, and I will build him a faithful
house, and he shall walk all days before my anointed.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall remain in
thy house, shall come that he may be prayed for, and shall offer a
piece of silver, and a roll of bread, and shall say: Put me, I
beseech thee, to somewhat of the priestly office, that I may eat a
morsel of bread.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="3">1 Samuel 3</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Now the child Samuel ministered to the Lord before Heli,
and the word of the Lord was precious in those days, there was no
manifest vision.</span></li>
<li><span>And it came to pass one day when Heli lay in his place,
and his eyes were grown dim, that he could not see:</span></li>
<li><span>Before the lamp of God went out, Samuel slept in the
temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord called Samuel. And he answered: Here am
I.</span></li>
<li><span>And he ran to Heli and said: Here am I: for thou didst
call me. He said: I did not call: go back and sleep. And he went
and slept.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord called Samuel again. And Samuel arose and
went to Heli, and said: Here am I: for thou calledst me. He
answered: I did not call thee, my son: return and
sleep.</span></li>
<li><span>Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, neither had the
word of the Lord been revealed to him.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord called Samuel again the third time. And he
arose up and went to Heli.</span></li>
<li><span>And said: Here am I: for thou didst call me. Then Heli
understood that the Lord called the child, and he said to Samuel:
Go, and sleep: and if he shall call thee any more, thou shalt say:
Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and slept in
his place.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord came and stood: and he called, as he had
called the other times: Samuel, Samuel. And Samuel said: Speak,
Lord, for thy servant heareth.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Samuel: Behold I do a thing in
Israel: and whosoever shall hear it, both his ears shall
tingle.</span></li>
<li><span>In that day I will raise up against Heli all the things I
have spoken concerning his house: I will begin, and I will make an
end.</span></li>
<li><span>For I have foretold unto him, that I will judge his house
for ever, for iniquity, because he knew that his sons did wickedly,
and did not chastise them.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore have I sworn to the house of Hell, that the
iniquity of his house shall not be expiated with victims nor
offerings for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel slept till morning, and opened the doors of
the house of the Lord. And Samuel feared to tell the vision to
Hell.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Heli called Samuel, and said: Samuel, my son. And he
answered: Here am I.</span></li>
<li><span>And he asked him: What is the word that the Lord hath
spoken to thee? I beseech thee hide it not from me. May God do so
and so to thee, and add so and so, if thou hide from me one word of
all that were said to thee.</span></li>
<li><span>So Samuel told him all the words, and did not hide them
from him. And he answered: It is the Lord: let him do what is good
in his sight.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and not one
of his words fell to the ground.</span></li>
<li><span>And all Israel from Dan to Bersabee, knew that Samuel was
a faithful prophet of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord again appeared in Silo, for the Lord
revealed himself to Samuel in Silo, according to the word of the
Lord. And the word of Samuel came to pass to all
Israel.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="4">1 Samuel 4</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines
gathered themselves together to fight: and Israel went out to war
against the Philistines, and camped by the Stone of help. And the
Philistines came to Aphec,</span></li>
<li><span>And put their army in array against Israel. And when they
had joined battle, Israel turned their backs to the Philistines,
and there was slain in that fight here and there in the fields
about four thousand men.</span></li>
<li><span>And the people returned to the camp: and the ancients of
Israel said: Why hath the Lord defeated us to day before the
Philistines? Let us fetch unto us the ark of the covenant of the
Lord from Silo, and let it come in the midst of us, that it may
save us from the hand of our enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>So the people sent to Silo, and they brought from thence
the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts sitting upon the
cherubims: and the two sons of Heli, Ophni and Phinees, were with
the ark of the covenant of God.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord was come
into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, and the earth
rang again.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, and
they said: What is this noise of a great shout in the camp of the
Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the Lord was come into
the camp.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Philistines were afraid, saying: God is come into
the camp. And sighing, they said:</span></li>
<li><span>Woe to us: for there was no such great joy yesterday and
the day before: Woe to us. Who shall deliver us from the hand of
these high gods? these are the gods that struck Egypt with all the
plagues in the desert.</span></li>
<li><span>Take courage and behave like men, ye Philistines: lest
you come to be servants to the Hebrews, as they have served you:
take courage and fight.</span></li>
<li><span>So the Philistines fought, and Israel was overthrown, and
every man fled to his own dwelling: and there was an exceeding
great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand
footmen.</span></li>
<li><span>And the ark of God was taken: and the two sons of Heli,
Ophni and Phinees, were slain.</span></li>
<li><span>And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came
to Silo the same day, with his clothes rent, and his head strewed
with dust.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he was come, Heli sat upon a stool over against
the way watching. For his heart was fearful for the ark of God. And
when the man was come into the city, he told it: and all the city
cried out.</span></li>
<li><span>And Heli heard the noise of the cry, and he said: What
meaneth the noise of this uproar? But he made haste, and came, and
told Heli.</span></li>
<li><span>Now Heli was ninety and eight years old, and his eyes
were dim, and he could not see.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to Heli: I am he that came from the battle,
and have fled out of the field this day. And he said to him: What
is there done, my son?</span></li>
<li><span>And he that brought the news answered, and said: Israel
has fled before the Philistines, and there has been a great
slaughter of the people: moreover thy two sons, Ophni and Phinees,
are dead: and the ark of God is taken.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he had named the ark of God, he fell from his
stool backwards by the door, and broke his neck, and died. For he
was an old man, and far advanced in years: and he judged Israel
forty years.</span></li>
<li><span>And his daughter in law the wife of Phinees, was big with
child, and near her time: and hearing the news that the ark of God
was taken, and her father in law, and her husband, were dead, she
bowed herself and fell in labour: for her pains came upon her on a
sudden.</span></li>
<li><span>And when she was upon the point of death, they that stood
about her said to her: Fear not, for thou hast borne a son. She
answered them not, nor gave heed to them.</span></li>
<li><span>And she called the child Ichabod, saying: The glory is
gone from Israel, because the ark of God was taken, and for her
father in law, and her husband:</span></li>
<li><span>And she said: The glory is departed from Israel, because
the ark of God was taken.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="5">1 Samuel 5</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And the Philistines took the ark of God, and carried it
from the Stone of help into Azotus.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it
into the temple of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the Azotians arose early the next day, behold
Dagon lay upon his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord:
and they took Dagon, and set him again in his place.</span></li>
<li><span>And the next day again, when they rose in the morning,
they found Dagon lying upon his face on the earth before the ark of
the Lord: and the head of Dagon, and both the palms of his hands
were cut off upon the threshold:</span></li>
<li><span>And only the stump of Dagon remained in its place. For
this cause neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that go into the
temple tread on the threshold of Dagon in Azotus unto this
day.</span></li>
<li><span>And the hand of the Lord was heavy upon the Azotians, and
he destroyed them, and afflicted Azotus and the coasts thereof with
emerods. And in the villages and fields in the midst of that
country, there came forth a multitude of mice, and there was the
confusion of a great mortality in the city.</span></li>
<li><span>And the men of Azotus seeing this kind of plague, said:
The ark of the God of Israel shall not stay with us: for his hand
is heavy upon us, and upon Dagon our god.</span></li>
<li><span>And sending, they gathered together all the lords of the
Philistines to them, and said: What shall we do with the ark of the
God of Israel? And the Gethrites answered: Let the ark of the God
of Israel be carried about. And they carried the ark of the God of
Israel about.</span></li>
<li><span>And while they were carrying it about, the band of the
Lord came upon every city with an exceeding great slaughter: and he
smote the men of every city, both small and great, and they had
emerods in their secret parts. And the Gethrites consulted
together, and made themselves seats of skins.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore they sent the ark of God into Accaron. And when
the ark of God was come into Accaron, the Accaronites cried out,
saying: They have brought the ark of the God of Israel to us, to
kill us and our people.</span></li>
<li><span>They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords
of the Philistines: and they said: Send away the ark of the God of
Israel, and let it return into its own place, and not kill us and
our people.</span></li>
<li><span>For there was the fear of death in every city, and the
hand of God was exceeding heavy. The men also that did not die,
were afflicted with the emerods: and the cry of every city went up
to heaven.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="6">1 Samuel 6</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Now the ark of God was in the land of the Philistines
seven months.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Philistines called for the priests and the
diviners, saying: What shall we do with the ark of the Lord? tell
us how we are to send it back to its place? And they
said:</span></li>
<li><span>If you send back the ark of the God of Israel, send it
not away empty, but render unto him what you owe for sin, and then
you shall be healed: and you shall know why his hand departeth not
from you.</span></li>
<li><span>They answered: What is it we ought to render unto him for
sin? and they answered:</span></li>
<li><span>According to the number of the provinces of the
Philistines you shall make five golden emerods, and five golden
mice: for the same plague hath been upon you all, and upon your
lords. And you shall make the likeness of your emerods, and the
likeness of the mice that have destroyed the land, and you shall
give glory to the God of Israel: to see if he will take off his
hand from you, and from your gods, and from your land.</span></li>
<li><span>Why do you harden your hearts, as Egypt and Pharao
hardened their hearts? did not he, after he was struck, then let
them go, and they departed?</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore take and make a new cart: and two kine that
have calved, on which there hath come no yoke, tie to the cart, and
shut up their calves at home.</span></li>
<li><span>And you shall take the ark of the Lord, and lay it on the
cart, and the vessels of gold, which you have paid him for sin, you
shall put into a little box, at the side thereof: and send it away
that it may go.</span></li>
<li><span>And you shall look: and if it go up by the way of his own
coasts towards Bethsames, then he hath done us this great evil: but
if not, we shall know that it is not his hand hath touched us, but
it hath happened by chance.</span></li>
<li><span>They did therefore in this manner: and taking two kine,
that had suckling calves, they yoked them to the cart, and shut up
their calves at home.</span></li>
<li><span>And they laid the ark of God upon the cart, and the
little box that had in it the golden mice and the likeness of the
emerods.</span></li>
<li><span>And the kine took the straight way that leadeth to
Bethsames, and they went along the way, lowing as they went: and
turned not aside neither to the right hand nor to the left: and the
lords of the Philistines followed them as far as the borders of
Bethsames.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the Bethsamites were reaping wheat in the valley: and
lifting up their eyes they saw the ark, and rejoiced to see
it.</span></li>
<li><span>And the cart came into the field of Josue a Bethsamite,
and stood there. And there was a great stone, and they cut in
pieces the wood of the cart, and laid the kine upon it a holocaust
to the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Levites took down the ark of God, and the little
box that was at the side of it, wherein were the vessels of gold,
and they put them upon the great stone. The men also of Bethsames
offered holocausts and sacrificed victims that day to the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And the five princes of the Philistines saw, and they
returned to Accaron the same day.</span></li>
<li><span>And these are the golden emerods, which the Philistines
returned for sin to the Lord: For Azotus one, for Gaza one, for
Ascalon one, for Geth one, for Accaron one:</span></li>
<li><span>And the golden mice according to the number of the cities
of the Philistines, of the five provinces, from the fenced city to
the village that was without wall, and to the great Abel (the
stone) whereon they set down the ark of the Lord, which was till
that day in the field of Josue the Bethsamite.</span></li>
<li><span>But he slew of the men of Bethsames, because they had
seen the ark of the Lord: and he slew of the people seventy men,
and fifty thousand of the common people. And the people lamented,
because the Lord had smitten the people with a great
slaughter.</span></li>
<li><span>And the men of Bethsames said: Who shall be able to stand
before the Lord this holy God? and to whom shall he go up from
us?</span></li>
<li><span>And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of
Cariathiarim, saying: The Philistines have brought back the ark of
the Lord, come ye down and fetch it up to you.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="7">1 Samuel 7</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And then men of Cariathiarim came and fetched up the ark
of the Lord and carried it into the house of Abinadab in Gabaa: and
they sanctified Eleazar his son, to keep the ark of the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And it came to pass, that from the day the ark of the
Lord abode in Cariathiarim days were multiplied, (for it was now
the twentieth year,) and all the house of Israel rested following
the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying: If
you turn to the Lord with all your heart, put away the strange gods
from among you, Baalim and Astaroth: and prepare your hearts unto
the Lord, and serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the
hand of the Philistines.</span></li>
<li><span>Then the children of Israel put away Baalim and Astaroth,
and served the Lord only.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel said: Gather all Israel to Masphath, that I
may pray to the Lord for you.</span></li>
<li><span>And they gathered together to Masphath: and they drew
water, and poured it out before the Lord, and they fasted on that
day, and they said there: We have sinned against the Lord. And
Samuel judged the children of Israel in Masphath.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Philistines heard that the children of Israel
were gathered together to Masphath, and the lords of the
Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel
heard this, they were afraid of the Philistines.</span></li>
<li><span>And they said to Samuel: Cease not to cry to the Lord our
God for us, that he may save us out of the hand of the
Philistines.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it whole for
a holocaust to the Lord: and Samuel cried to the Lord for Israel,
and the Lord heard him.</span></li>
<li><span>And it came to pass, when Samuel was offering the
holocaust, the Philistines began the battle against Israel: but the
Lord thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the
Philistines, and terrified them, and they were overthrown before
the face of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And the men of Israel going out of Masphath pursued after
the Philistines, and made slaughter of them till they came under
Bethchar.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel took a stone, and laid it between Masphath and
Sen: and he called the place, the Stone of help. And he said: Thus
far the Lord hath helped us.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Philistines were humbled, and they did not come
any more into the borders of Israel. And the hand of the Lord was
against the Philistines, all the days of Samuel.</span></li>
<li><span>And the cities, which the Philistines had taken from
Israel, were restored to Israel, from Accaron to Geth, and their
borders: and he delivered Israel from the hand of the Philistines,
and there was peace between Israel and the Amorrhites.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his
life:</span></li>
<li><span>And he went every year about to Bethel and to Galgal and
to Masphath, and he judged Israel in the aforesaid
places.</span></li>
<li><span>And he returned to Ramatha, for there was his house, and
there he judged Israel: he built also there an altar to the
Lord.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="8">1 Samuel 8</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And it came to pass when Samuel was old, that he
appointed his sons to be judges over Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the name of his firstborn son was Joel: and the name
of the second was Abia, judges in Bersabee.</span></li>
<li><span>And his sons walked not in his ways: but they turned
aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted
judgment.</span></li>
<li><span>Then all the ancients of Israel being assembled, came to
Samuel to Ramatha.</span></li>
<li><span>And they said to him: Behold thou art old, and thy sons
walk not in thy ways: make us a king, to judge us, as all nations
have.</span></li>
<li><span>And the word was displeasing in the eyes of Samuel, that
they should say: Give us a king, to judge us. And Samuel prayed to
the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Samuel: Hearken to the voice of the
people in all that they say to thee. For they have not rejected
thee, but me, that I should not reign over them.</span></li>
<li><span>According to all their works, they have done from the day
that I brought them out of Egypt until this day: as they have
forsaken me, and served strange gods, so do they also unto
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore hearken to their voice: but yet testify to
them, and foretell them the right of the king, that shall reign
over them.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Samuel told all the words of the Lord to the people
that had desired a king of him,</span></li>
<li><span>And said: This will be the right of the king, that shall
reign over you: He will take your sons, and put them in his
chariots, and will make them his horsemen, and his running footmen
to run before his chariots,</span></li>
<li><span>And he will appoint of them to be his tribunes, and
centurions, and to plough his fields, and to reap his corn, and to
make him arms and chariots.</span></li>
<li><span>Your daughters also he will take to make him ointments,
and to be his cooks, and bakers.</span></li>
<li><span>And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and
your best oliveyards, and give them to his servants.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover he will take the tenth of your corn, and of the
revenues of your vineyards, to give his eunuchs and
servants.</span></li>
<li><span>Your servants also and handmaids, and your goodliest
young men, and your asses he will take away, and put them to his
work.</span></li>
<li><span>Your flocks also he will tithe, and you shall be his
servants.</span></li>
<li><span>And you shall cry out in that day from the face of the
king, whom you have chosen to yourselves. and the Lord will not
hear you in that day, because you desired unto yourselves a
king.</span></li>
<li><span>But the people would not hear the voice of Samuel, and
they said: Nay: but there shall be a king over us.</span></li>
<li><span>And we also will be like all nations: and our king shall
judge us, and go out before us, and tight our battles for
us.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and
rehearsed them in the ears of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Samuel: Hearken to their voice, and
make them a king. And Samuel said to the men of Israel: Let every
man go to his city.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="9">1 Samuel 9</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Now I there was a man of Benjamin whose name was Cis, the
son of Abiel, the son of Seror, the son of Bechorath, the son of
Aphia, the son of a man of Jemini, valiant and strong.</span></li>
<li><span>And he had a son whose name was Saul, a choice and goodly
man, and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier
person than he: from his shoulders and upward he appeared above all
the people.</span></li>
<li><span>And the asses of Cis, Sauls father, were lost: and Cis
said to his son Saul: Take one of the servants with thee, and
arise, go, and seek the asses. And when they had passed through
mount Ephraim,</span></li>
<li><span>And through the land of Salisa, and had not found them,
they passed also through the land of Salim, and they were not
there: and through the land of Jemini, and found them
not.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they were come to the land of Suph, Saul said to
the servant that was with him: Come, let us return, lest perhaps my
father forget the asses, and be concerned for us.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to him: Behold there is a man of God in this
city, a famous man: all that he saith, cometh certainly to pass.
Now therefore let us go thither, perhaps he may tell us of our way,
for which we are come.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said to his servant: Behold we will go: but what
shall we carry to the man of God? the bread is spent in our bags:
and we have no present to make to the man of God, nor any thing at
all.</span></li>
<li><span>The servant answered Saul again, and said: Behold there
is found in my hand the fourth part of a sicle of silver, let us
give it to the man of God, that he may tell us our way.</span></li>
<li><span>Now in time past, in Israel when a man went to consult
God he spoke thus: Come, let us go to the seer. For he that is now
called a prophet, in time past was called a seer.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said to his servant: Thy word is very good,
come, let us go. And they went into the city, where the man of God
was.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they went up the ascent to the city, they found
maids coming out to draw water, and they said to them: Is the seer
here?</span></li>
<li><span>They answered and said to them: He is: behold he is
before you, make haste now: for he came to day into the city, for
there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high
place.</span></li>
<li><span>As soon as you come into the city, you shall immediately
find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people
will not eat till he come: because he blesseth the victim, and
afterwards they eat that are invited. Now therefore go up, for to
day you shall find him.</span></li>
<li><span>And they went up into the city. And when they were
walking in the midst of the city, behold Samuel was coming out over
against them, to go up to the high place.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the Lord had revealed to the ear of Samuel the day
before Saul came, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>To morrow about this same hour I will send thee a man of
the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be ruler over my
people Israel: and he shall save my people out of the hand of the
Philistines: for I have looked down upon my people, because their
cry is come to me.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Samuel saw Saul, the Lord said to him: Behold
the man, of whom I spoke to thee, this man shall reign over my
people.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul came to Samuel in the midst of the gate and
said: Tell me, I pray thee, where is the house of the
seer?</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel answered Saul, saying: I am the seer, go up
before me to the high place, that you may eat with me to day, and I
will let thee go in the morning: and tell thee all that is in thy
heart.</span></li>
<li><span>And as for the asses, which were lost three days ago, be
not solicitous, because they are found. And for whom shall be all
the best things of Israel? Shall they not be for thee and for all
thy father's house?</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul answering, said: Am not I a son of Jemini of the
least tribe of Israel, and my kindred the last among all the
families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then hast thou spoken this
word to me?</span></li>
<li><span>Then Samuel taking Saul and his servant, brought them
into the parlour, and gave them a place at the head of them that
were invited. For there were about thirty men.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel said to the cook: Bring the portion, which I
gave thee, and commanded thee to set it apart by thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And the cook took up the shoulder, and set it before
Saul. And Samuel said: Behold what is left, set it before thee, and
eat: because it was kept of purpose for thee, when I invited the
people. And Saul ate with Samuel that day.</span></li>
<li><span>And they went down from the high place into the town, and
he spoke with Saul upon the top of the house: and he prepared a bed
for Saul on the top of the house, and he slept.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they were risen in the morning, and it began now
to be light, Samuel called Saul on the top of the house, saying:
Arise, that I may let thee go. And Saul arose: and they went out
both of them, to wit, he and Samuel.</span></li>
<li><span>And as they were going down in the end of the city,
Samuel said to Saul: Speak to the servant to go before us, and pass
on: but stand thou still a while, that I may tell thee the word of
the Lord.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="10">1 Samuel 10</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And Samuel took a little vial of oil and poured it upon
his head, and kissed him, and said: Behold, the Lord hath anointed
thee to be prince over his inheritance, and thou shalt deliver his
people out of the hands of their enemies, that are round about
them. And this shall be a sign unto thee, that God hath anointed
thee to be prince.</span></li>
<li><span>When thou shalt depart from me this day, thou shalt find
two men by the sepulchre of Rachel in the borders of Benjamin to
the south, and they shall say to thee: The asses are found which
thou wentest to seek: and thy father thinking no more of the asses
is concerned for you, and saith: What shall I do for my
son?</span></li>
<li><span>And when thou shalt depart from thence, and go farther
on, and shalt come to the oak of Thabor, there shall meet thee
three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and
another three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of
wine.</span></li>
<li><span>And they will salute thee, and will give thee two loaves,
and thou shalt take them at their hand.</span></li>
<li><span>After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where the
garrison of the Philistines is: and when thou shalt be come there
into the city, thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down
from the high place, with a psaltery and a timbrel, and a pipe, and
a harp before them, and they shall be prophesying.</span></li>
<li><span>And the spirit of the Lord shall come upon thee, and thou
shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be changed into another
man.</span></li>
<li><span>When therefore these signs shall happen to thee, do
whatsoever thy hand shall find, for the Lord is with
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt go down before me to Galgal, (for I will
come down to thee,) that thou mayest offer an oblation, and
sacrifice victims of peace: seven days shalt thou wait, O till I
come to thee, and I will shew thee what thou art to do.</span></li>
<li><span>So when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God
gave unto him another heart, and all these things came to pass that
day.</span></li>
<li><span>And they came to the foresaid hill, and behold a company
of prophets met him: and the spirit of the Lord came upon him, and
he prophesied in the midst of them.</span></li>
<li><span>And all that had known him yesterday and the day before,
seeing that he was with the prophets, and prophesied, said to each
other: What is this that hath happened to the son of Cis? Is Saul
also among the prophets?</span></li>
<li><span>And one answered another, saying: And who is their
father? therefore it became a proverb: Is Saul also among the
prophets?</span></li>
<li><span>And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to
the high place.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul's uncle said to him, and to his servant: Whither
went you? They answered: To seek the asses: and not finding them we
went to Samuel.</span></li>
<li><span>And his uncle said to him: Tell me what Samuel said to
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said to his uncle: He told us that the asses
were found. But of the matter of the kingdom of which Samuel had
spoken to him, he told him not.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel called together the people to the Lord in
Maspha:</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to the children of Israel: Thus saith the
Lord the God of Israel: I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and
delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians, and from the hand of
all the kings who afflicted you.</span></li>
<li><span>But you this day have rejected your God, who only hath
saved you out of all your evils and your tribulations: and you have
said: Nay: but set a king over us. Now therefore stand before the
Lord by your tribes, and by your families.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel brought to him all the tribes of Israel, and
the lot fell on the tribe of Benjamin.</span></li>
<li><span>And he brought the tribe of Benjamin and the kindreds
thereof, and the lot fell Upon the kindred of Metri, and it came to
Saul the son of Cis. They sought him therefore and he was not
found.</span></li>
<li><span>And after this they consulted the Lord whether he would
come thither. And the Lord answered: Behold he is hidden at
home.</span></li>
<li><span>And they ran and fetched him thence: and he stood in the
midst of the people, and he was higher than any of the people from
the shoulders and upward.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel said to all the people: Surely you see him
whom the Lord hath chosen, that there is none like him among all
the people. And all the people cried and said: God save the
king.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel told the people the law of the kingdom, and
wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the Lord: and Samuel sent
away all the people, every one to his own house.</span></li>
<li><span>Saul also departed to his own house in Gabaa: and there
went with him a part of the army, whose hearts God had
touched.</span></li>
<li><span>But the children of Belial said: Shall this fellow be
able to save us? And they despised him, and brought him no
presents, but he dissembled as though he heard not.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="11">1 Samuel 11</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And it came to pass about a month after this that Naas,
the Ammonite came up, and began to fight against Jabes Galaad. And
all the men of Jabes said to Naas: Make a covenant with us, and we
will serve thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And Naas the Ammonite answered them: On this condition
will I make a covenant with you, that I may pluck out all your
right eyes, and make you a reproach in all Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And the ancients of Jabes said to him: Allow us seven
days, that we may send messengers to all the coasts of Israel: and
if there be no one to defend us, we will come out to
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>The messengers therefore came to Gabaa of Saul: and they
spoke these words in the hearing of the people: and all the people
lifted up their voices, and wept.</span></li>
<li><span>And behold Saul came, following oxen out of the field,
and he said: What aileth the people that they weep? And they told
him the words of the men of Jabes.</span></li>
<li><span>And the spirit of the Lord came upon Saul, when he had
heard these words, and his anger was exceedingly
kindled.</span></li>
<li><span>And taking both the oxen, he cut them in pieces, and sent
them into all the coasts of Israel by messengers, saying: Whosoever
shall not come forth, and follow Saul and Samuel, so shall it be
done to his oxen. And the fear of the Lord fell upon the people,
and they went out as one man.</span></li>
<li><span>And he numbered them in Bezec: and there were of the
children of Israel three hundred thousand: and of the men of Juda
thirty thousand.</span></li>
<li><span>And they said to the messengers that came: Thus shall you
say to the men of Jabes Galaad: Tomorrow, when the sun shall be
hot, you shall have relief. The messengers therefore came, and told
the men of Jabes: and they were glad.</span></li>
<li><span>And they said: In the morning we will come out to you:
and you shall do what you please with us.</span></li>
<li><span>And it came to pass, when the morrow was come that Saul
put the people in three companies: and he came into the midst of
the camp in the morning watch, and he slew the Ammonites until the
day grew hot, and the rest were scattered, so that two of them were
not left together.</span></li>
<li><span>And the people said to Samuel: Who is he that said: Shall
Saul reign over us? Bring the men and we will kill
them.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said: No man shall be killed this day, because
the Lord this day hath wrought salvation in Israel:</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel said to the people: Come and let us go to
Galgal, and let us renew the kingdom there.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the people went to Galgal, and there they made
Saul king before the Lord in Galgal, and they sacrificed there
victims of peace before the Lord. And there Saul and all the men of
Israel rejoiced exceedingly</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="12">1 Samuel 12</a></div>

<li><span>And Samuel said to all Israel: Behold I have hearkened to
your voice in all that you said to me, and have made a king over
you.</span></li>
<li><span>And now the king goeth before you: but I am old and
greyheaded: and my sons are with you: having then conversed with
you from my youth unto this day, behold here I am.</span></li>
<li><span>Speak of me before the Lord, and before his anointed,
whether I have taken any man's ox, or ass: If I have wronged any
man, if I have oppressed any man, if I have taken a bribe at any
man's hand: and I will despise it this day, and will restore it to
you.</span></li>
<li><span>And they said: Thou hast not wronged us, nor oppressed
us, nor taken ought at any man's hand.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to them: The Lord is witness against you, and
his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found any thing
in my hand. And they said: He is witness.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel said to the people: It is the Lord, who made
Moses and Aaron, and brought our fathers out of the land of
Egypt.</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore stand up, that I may plead in judgment
against you before the Lord, concerning all the kindness of the
Lord, which he hath shewn to you, and to your fathers:</span></li>
<li><span>How Jacob went into Egypt, and your fathers cried to the
Lord: and the Lord sent Moses and Aaron, and brought your fathers
out of Egypt: and made them dwell in this place.</span></li>
<li><span>And they forgot the Lord their God, and he delivered them
into the hands of Sisara, captain of the army of Hasor, and into
the hands of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of
Moab, and they fought against them.</span></li>
<li><span>But afterwards they cried to the Lord, and said: We have
sinned, because we have forsaken the Lord, and have served Baalim
and Astaroth: but now deliver us from the hand of our enemies, and
we will serve thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord sent Jerobaal, and Badan, and Jephte, and
Samuel, and delivered you from the hand of your enemies round
about, and you dwelt securely.</span></li>
<li><span>But seeing that Naas king of the children of Ammon was
come against you, you said to me: Nay, but a king shall reign over
us: whereas the Lord your God was your king.</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore your king is here, whom you have chosen and
desired: Behold the Lord hath given you a king.</span></li>
<li><span>If you will fear the Lord, and serve him, and hearken to
his voice, and not provoke the mouth of the Lord: then shall both
you, and the king who reigneth over you, be followers of the Lord
your God.</span></li>
<li><span>But if you will not hearken to the voice of the Lord, but
will rebel against his words, the hand of the Lord shall be upon
you, and upon your fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>Now then stand, and see this great thing which the Lord
will do in your sight.</span></li>
<li><span>Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call upon the
Lord, and he shall send thunder and rain: and you shall know and
see that you yourselves have done a great evil in the sight of the
Lord, in desiring a king over you.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel cried unto the Lord, and the Lord sent thunder
and rain that day.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the people greatly feared the Lord and Samuel.
And all the people said to Samuel: Pray for thy servants to the
Lord thy God, that we may not die, for we have added to all our
sins this evil, to ask for a king.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel said to the people: Fear not, you have done
all this evil: but yet depart not from following the Lord, but
serve the Lord with all your heart.</span></li>
<li><span>And turn not aside after vain things which shall never
profit you, nor deliver you, because they are vain.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord will not forsake his people for his great
name's sake: because the Lord hath sworn to make you his
people.</span></li>
<li><span>And far from me be this sin against the Lord, that I
should cease to pray for you, and I will teach you the good and
right way.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore fear the Lord, and serve him in truth and with
your whole heart, for you have seen the great works which he hath
done among you.</span></li>

shall perish together.</span></li>

<li><span>Saul was a child of one year when he began to reign, and
he reigned two years over Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel: and two
thousand were with Saul in Machmas, and in mount Bethel: and a
thousand with Jonathan in Gabaa of Benjamin, and the rest of the
people he sent back every man to their dwellings.</span></li>

was in Gabaa. And when the Philistines had heard of it, Saul
sounded the trumpet over all the land, saying: Let the Hebrews
hear.</span></li>
<li><span>And all Israel heard this report: Saul hath smitten the
garrison of the Philistines: and Israel took courage against the
Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to
Galgal.</span></li>
<li><span>The Philistines also were assembled to fight against
Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and a
multitude of people besides, like the sand on the sea shore for
number. And going up they camped in Machmas at the east of
Bethaven.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the men of Israel saw that they were straitened,
(for the people were distressed,) they hid themselves in caves, and
in thickets, and in rocks, and in dens, and in pits.</span></li>
<li><span>And some of the Hebrews passed over the Jordan into the
land of Gad and Galaad. And when Saul was yet in Galgal, all the
people that followed him were greatly afraid.</span></li>
<li><span>And he waited seven days according to the appointment of
Samuel, I and Samuel came not to Galgal, and the people slipt away
from him.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Saul said: Bring me the holocaust, and the peace
offerings. And he offered the holocaust.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he had made an end of offering the holocaust,
behold Samuel came: and Saul went forth to meet him and salute
him.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel said to him: What hast thou done? Saul
answered: Because I saw that the people slipt from me, and thou
wast not come according to the days appointed, and the Philistines
were gathered together in Machmas,</span></li>
<li><span>I said: Now will the Philistines come down upon me to
Galgal, and I have not appeased the face of the Lord. Forced by
necessity, I offered the holocaust.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel said to Saul: Thou hast done foolishly, and
hast not kept the commandments of the Lord thy God, which he
commanded thee. And if thou hadst not done thus, the Lord would now
have established thy kingdom over Israel for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>But thy kingdom shall not continue. The Lord hath sought
him a man according to his own heart: and him hath the Lord
commanded to be prince over his people, because thou hast not
observed that which the Lord commanded.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel arose and went up from Galgal to Gabaa of
Benjamin. And the rest of the people went up after Saul, to meet
the people who fought against them, going from Galgal to Gabaa in
the hill of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people, that were found
with him, about six hundred men.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul and Jonathan his son, and the people that were
present with them, were in Gabaa of Benjamin: but the Philistines
encamped in Machmas.</span></li>
<li><span>And there went out of the camp of the Philistines three
companies to plunder. One company went towards the way of Ephra to
the land of Sual;</span></li>
<li><span>And another went by the way of Beth-horon, and the third
turned to the way of the border, above the valley of Seboim towards
the desert.</span></li>
<li><span>Now there was no smith to be found in all the land of
Israel, for the Philistines had taken this precaution, lest the
Hebrews should make them swords or spears.</span></li>
<li><span>So all Israel went down to the Philistines, to sharpen
every man his ploughshare, and his spade, and his axe, and his
rake.</span></li>
<li><span>So that their shares, and their spades, and their forks,
and their axes were blunt, even to the goad, which was to be
mended.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the day of battle was come, there was neither
sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were
with Saul and Jonathan, except Saul and Jonathan his
son.</span></li>
<li><span>And the army of the Philistines went out in order to
advance further in Machmas.</span></li>

</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="14">1 Samuel 14</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Now it came to pass one day that Jonathan the son of Saul
said to the young man that bore his armour: Come, and let us go
over to the garrison of the Philistines, which is on the other side
of yonder place. But he told not this to his father.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul abode in the uttermost part of Gabaa under the
pomegranate tree, which was in Magron: and the people with him were
about six hundred men.</span></li>
<li><span>And Achias the son of Achitob brother to Ichabod the son
of Phinees, the son of Heli the priest of the Lord in Silo, wore
the ephod. And the people knew not whither Jonathan was
gone.</span></li>
<li><span>Now there were between the ascents, by which Jonathan
sought to go over to the garrison of the Philistines, rocks
standing up on both sides, and steep cliffs like teeth on the one
side, and on the other, the name of the one was Boses, and the name
of the other was Sene:</span></li>
<li><span>One rock stood out towards the north over against
Machmas, and the other to the south over against Gabaa.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armour:
Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised, it may
be the Lord will do for us, because it is easy for the Lord to save
either by many, or by few.</span></li>
<li><span>And his armourbearer said to him: Do all that pleaseth
thy mind: go whither thou wilt, and I will be with thee wheresoever
thou hast a mind.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jonathan said: Behold we will go over to these men.
And when we shall be seen by them,</span></li>
<li><span>If they shall speak thus to us: Stay till we come to you:
let us stand still in our place, and not go up to them.</span></li>
<li><span>But if they shall say: Come up to us: let us go up,
because the Lord hath delivered them into our hands, this shall be
a sign unto us.</span></li>
<li><span>So both of them discovered themselves to the garrison of
the Philistines: and the Philistines said: Behold the Hebrews come
forth out of the holes wherein they were hid.</span></li>
<li><span>And the men of the garrison spoke to Jonathan, and to his
armourbearer, and said: Come up to us, and we will shew you a
thing. And Jonathan said to his armourbearer: Let us go up, follow
me: for the Lord hath delivered them into the hands of I
srael.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jonathan went up creeping on his hands and feet, and
his armourbearer after him. And some fell before Jonathan, others
his armourbearer slew as he followed him.</span></li>
<li><span>And the first slaughter which Jonathan and his
armourbearer made, was of about twenty men, within half an acre of
land, which a yoke of oxen is wont to plough in a day.</span></li>
<li><span>And there was a miracle in the camp, through the fields:
yea and all the people of their garrison, who had gone out to
plunder, were amazed, and the earth trembled: and it happened as a
miracle from God.</span></li>
<li><span>And the watchmen of Saul, who were in Gabaa of Benjamin
looked, and behold a multitude overthrown, and fleeing this way and
that.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said to the people that were with him: Look, and
see who is gone from us. And when they had sought, it was found
that Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said to Achias: Bring the ark of the Lord. (For
the ark of God was there that day with the children of
Israel.)</span></li>
<li><span>And while Saul spoke to the priest, there arose a great
uproar in the camp of the Philistines: and it increased by degrees,
and was heard more clearly. And Saul said to the priest: Draw in
thy hand.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Saul and all the people that were with him, shouted
together, and they came to the place of the fight: and behold every
man's sword was turned upon his neighbour, and there was a very
great slaughter.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover the Hebrews that had been with the Philistines
yesterday and the day before, and went up with them into the camp,
returned to be with the Israelites, who were with Saul and
Jonathan.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the Israelites that had hid themselves in mount
Ephraim, hearing that the Philistines fled, joined themselves with
their countrymen in the fight. And there were with Saul about ten
thousand men.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord saved Israel that day. And the fight went on
as far as Bethaven.</span></li>
<li><span>And the men of Israel were joined together that day; and
Saul adjured the people, saying: Cursed be the man that shall eat
food till evening, till I be revenged of my enemies. So none of the
people tasted any food:</span></li>
<li><span>And all the common people came into a forest, in which
there was honey upon the ground.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the people came into the forest, behold the
honey dropped, but no man put his hand to his mouth. For the people
feared the oath.</span></li>
<li><span>But Jonathan had not heard when his father adjured the
people: and he put forth the end of the rod, which he had in his
hand, and dipt it in a honeycomb: and he carried his hand to his
mouth, and his eyes were enlightened.</span></li>
<li><span>And one of the people answering, said: Thy father hath
bound the people with an oath, saying: Cursed be the man that shall
eat any food this day. (And the people were faint.)</span></li>
<li><span>And Jonathan said: My father hath troubled the land: you
have seen yourselves that my eyes are enlightened, because I tasted
a little of this honey:</span></li>
<li><span>How much more if the people had eaten of the prey of
their enemies, which they found? had there not been made a greater
slaughter among the Philistines?</span></li>
<li><span>So they smote that day the Philistines from Machmas to
Ailon. And the people were wearied exceedingly.</span></li>
<li><span>And falling upon the spoils, they took sheep, and oxen,
and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people ate them
with the blood.</span></li>
<li><span>And they told Saul that the people had sinned against the
Lord, eating with the blood. And he said: You have transgressed:
roll here to me now a great stone.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said: Disperse yourselves among the people, and
tell them to bring me every man his ox and his ram, and slay them
upon this stone, and eat, and you shall not sin against the Lord in
eating with the blood. So all the people brought every man his ox
with him till the night: and slew them there.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul built an altar to the Lord and he then first
began to build an altar to the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said: Let us fall upon the Philistines by night,
and destroy them till the morning light, and let us not leave a man
of them. And the people said: Do all that seemeth good in thy eyes.
And the priest said: Let us draw near hither unto God.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul consulted the Lord: Shall I pursue after the
Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hands of Israel? And
he answered him not that day.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said: Bring hither all the corners of the
people: and know, and see by whom this sin hath happened to
day.</span></li>
<li><span>As the Lord liveth who is the saviour of Israel, if it
was done by Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. In this none of
the people gainsaid him.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to all Israel: Be you on one side, and I with
Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people answered
Saul: Do what seemeth good in thy eyes.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said to the Lord: O Lord God of Israel, give a
sign, by which we may know, what the meaning is, that thou
answerest not thy servant to day. If this iniquity be in me, or in
my son Jonathan, give a proof: or if this iniquity be in thy
people, give holiness. And Jonathan and Saul were taken, and the
people escaped.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said: Cast lots between me, and Jonathan my son.
And Jonathan was taken.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said to Jonathan: Tell me what thou hast done.
And Jonathan told him, and said: I did but taste a little honey
with the end of the rod, which was in my hand, and behold I must
die.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said: May God do so and so to me, and add still
more: for dying thou shalt die, O Jonathan.</span></li>
<li><span>And the people said to Saul: Shall Jonathan then die, who
hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? This must not be. As
the Lord liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the
ground, for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people
delivered Jonathan, that he should not die.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul went back, and did not pursue after the
Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own
places.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul having his kingdom established over Israel,
fought against all his enemies round about, against Moab, and
against the children of Ammon, and Edom, and the kings of Soba, and
the Philistines; and whithersoever he turned himself, he
overcame.</span></li>
<li><span>And gathering together an army, he defeated Amalec, and
delivered Israel from the hand of them that spoiled
them.</span></li>
<li><span>And the sons of Saul, were Jonathan, and Jessui, and
Melchisua: and the names of his two daughters, the name of the
firstborn was Merob, and the name of the younger
Michol.</span></li>
<li><span>And the name of Saul's wife, was Achinoam the daughter of
Achimaas; and the name of the captain of his army was Abner, the
son of Ner, the cousin german of Saul.</span></li>
<li><span>For Cis was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of
Abner, was son of Abiel.</span></li>
<li><span>And there was a great war against the Philistines all the
days of Saul. For whomsoever Saul saw to be a valiant man, and fit
for war, he took him to himself.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="15">1 Samuel 15</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And Samuel said to Saul: The Lord sent me to anoint thee
king over his People Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the
voice of the Lord:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I have reckoned up all that
Amalec hath done to Israel: I how he opposed them in the way when
they came up out of Egypt.</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore go, and smite Amalec, and utterly destroy
all that he hath: spare him not, nor covet any thing that is his:
but slay both man and woman, child and suckling, ox and sheep,
camel and ass.</span></li>
<li><span>So Saul commanded the people, and numbered them as lambs:
two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand of the men of
Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Saul was come to the city of Amalec, he laid
ambushes in the torrent.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said to the Cinite: Go, depart and get ye down
from Amalec: lest I destroy thee with him. For thou hast shewn
kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of
Egypt. And the Cinite departed from the midst of
Amalec.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul smote Amalec from Hevila, until thou comest to
Sur, which is over against Egypt.</span></li>
<li><span>And he took Agag the king of Amalec alive: but all the
common people he slew with the edge of the sword.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the
flocks of sheep and of the herds, and the garments and the rams,
and all that was beautiful, and would not destroy them: but every
thing that was vile and good for nothing, that they
destroyed.</span></li>
<li><span>And the word of the Lord came to Samuel,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>It repenteth me that I have made Saul king: for he hath
forsaken me, and hath not executed my commandments. And Samuel was
grieved, and he cried unto the Lord all night.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Samuel rose early, to go to Saul in the morning,
it was told Samuel, that Saul was come to Carmel, and had erected
for himself a triumphant arch, and returning had passed on, and
gone down to Galgal. And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul was offering
a holocaust to the Lord out of the choicest of the spoils which he
had brought from Amalec.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Samuel was come to Saul, Saul said to him:
Blessed be thou of the Lord, I have fulfilled the word of the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel said: What meaneth then this bleating of the
flocks, which soundeth in my ears, and the lowing of the herds,
which I hear?</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said: They have brought them from Amalec: for
the people spared the best of the sheep and of the herds that they
might be sacrificed to the Lord thy God, but the rest we have
slain.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel said to Saul: Suffer me, and I will tell thee
what the Lord hath said to me this night. And he said to him:
Speak.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel said: When thou wast a little one in thy own
eyes, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel? And the
Lord anointed thee to be king over Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord sent thee on the way, and said: Go, and kill
the sinners of Amalec, and thou shalt fight against them until thou
hast utterly destroyed them.</span></li>
<li><span>Why then didst thou not hearken to the voice of the Lord:
but hast turned to the prey, and hast done evil in the eyes of the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said to Samuel: Yea I have hearkened to the
voice of the Lord, and have walked in the way by which the Lord
sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalec, and Amalec I
have slain.</span></li>
<li><span>But the people took of the spoils sheep and oxen, as the
firstfruits of those things that were slain, to offer sacrifice to
the Lord their God in Galgal.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel said: Doth the Lord desire holocausts and
victims, and not rather that the voice of the Lord should be
obeyed? For obedience is better than sacrifices: and to hearken
rather than to offer the fat of rams.</span></li>
<li><span>Because it is like the sin of witchcraft, to rebel: and
like the crime of idolatry, to refuse to obey. Forasmuch therefore
as thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, the Lord hath also
rejected thee from being king.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said to Samuel: I have sinned because I have
transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and thy words, fearing
the people, and obeying their voice.</span></li>
<li><span>But now bear, I beseech thee, my sin, and return with me,
that I may adore the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel said to Saul: I will not return with thee,
because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord hath
rejected thee from being king over Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel turned about to go away: but he laid hold upon
the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel said to him: The Lord hath rent the kingdom of
Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to thy neighbour who
is better than thee.</span></li>
<li><span>But the triumpher in Israel will riot spare, and will not
be moved to repentance: for he is not a mail that he should
repent.</span></li>
<li><span>Then he said: I have sinned: yet honour me now before the
ancients of my people, and before Israel, and return with me, that
I may adore the Lord thy God.</span></li>
<li><span>So Samuel turned again after Saul: and Saul adored the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel said: Bring hitherto me Agag the king of
Amalec. And Agag was presented to him very fat, and trembling. And
Agag said: Doth bitter death separate in this manner?</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel said: As thy sword hath made women childless,
so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed him
in pieces before the Lord in Galgal.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel departed to Ramatha: but Saul went up to his
house in Gabaa.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel saw Saul no more till the day of his death:
nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul, because the Lord repented
that he had made him king over Israel.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="16">1 Samuel 16</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Samuel. How It long wilt thou mourn
for Saul, whom I have rejected from reigning over Israel? fill thy
horn with oil, and come, that I may send thee to Isai the
Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his
sons.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel said: How shall I go? for Saul will hear of
it, and he will kill me. And the Lord said: Thou shalt take with
thee a calf of the herd, and thou shalt say: I am come to sacrifice
to the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt call Isai to the sacrifice, and I will
shew thee what thou art to do, and thou shalt anoint him whom I
shall shew to thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Samuel did as the Lord had said to him. And he came
to Bethlehem, and the ancients of the city wondered, and meeting
him, they said: Is thy coming hither peaceable?</span></li>
<li><span>And he said: It is peaceable: I am come to offer
sacrifice to the Lord, be ye sanctified, and come with me to the
sacrifice. And he sanctified Isai and his sons, and called them to
the sacrifice.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they were come in, he saw Eliab, and said: Is
the Lord's anointed before him?</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Samuel: Look not on his countenance,
nor on the height of his stature: because I have rejected him, nor
do I judge according to the look of man: for man seeth those things
that appear, but the Lord beholdeth the heart.</span></li>
<li><span>And Isai called Abinadab, and brought him before Samuel.
And he said: Neither hath the Lord chosen this.</span></li>
<li><span>And Isai brought Samma, and he said of him: Neither hath
the Lord chosen this.</span></li>
<li><span>Isai therefore brought his seven sons before Samuel: and
Samuel said to Isai: The Lord hath not chosen any one of
these.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel said to Isai: Are here all thy sons? He
answered: There remaineth yet a young one, who keepeth the sheep.
And Samuel said to Isai: Send, and fetch him, for we will not sit
down till he come hither.</span></li>
<li><span>He sent therefore and brought him Now he was ruddy and
beautiful to behold, and of a comely face. And the Lord said:
Arise, and anoint him, for this is he.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the
midst of his brethren: and the spirit of the Lord came upon David
from that day forward: and Samuel rose up, and went to
Ramatha.</span></li>
<li><span>But the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an
evil spirit from the Lord troubled him.</span></li>
<li><span>And the servants of Saul said to him: Behold now an evil
spirit from God troubleth thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Let our lord give orders, and thy servants who are before
thee will seek out a man skilful in playing on the harp, that when
the evil spirit from the Lord is upon thee, he may play with his
hand, and thou mayest bear it more easily.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said to his servants: Provide me then some man
that can play well, and bring him to me.</span></li>
<li><span>And one of the servants answering, said: Behold I have
seen a son of Isai the Bethlehemite, a skilful player, and one of
great strength, and a man fit for war, and prudent in his words,
and a comely person: and the Lord is with him.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Saul sent messengers to Isai, saying: Send me David
thy son, who is in the pastures.</span></li>
<li><span>And Isai took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of
wine, and a kid of the flock, and sent them by the hand of David
his son to Saul.</span></li>
<li><span>And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he
loved him exceedingly, and made him his armourbearer.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul sent to Isai, saying: Let David stand before me:
for he hath found favour in my sight.</span></li>
<li><span>So whensoever the evil spirit from the Lord was upon
Saul, David took his harp, and played with his hand, and Saul was
refreshed, and was better, for the evil spirit departed from
him.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="17">1 Samuel 17</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Now the Philistines gathering together their troops to
battle, assembled at Socho of Juda, and camped between Socho and
Azeca in the borders of Dommim.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul and the children of Israel being gathered
together came to the valley of Terebinth, and they set the army in
array to fight against the Philistines.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side,
and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a
valley between them.</span></li>
<li><span>And there went out a man baseborn from the camp of the
Philistines named Goliath, of Geth, whose height was six cubits and
a span:</span></li>
<li><span>And he had a helmet of brass upon his head, and he was
clothed with a coat of mail with scales, and the weight of his coat
of mail was five thousand sicles of brass:</span></li>
<li><span>And he had greaves of brass on his legs, and a buckler of
brass covered his shoulders.</span></li>
<li><span>And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam, and
the head of his spear weighed six hundred sicles of iron: and his
armourbearer went before him.</span></li>
<li><span>And standing he cried out to the bands of Israel, and
said to them: Why are you come out prepared to fight? am not I a
Philistine, and you the servants of Saul? Choose out a man of you,
and let him come down and fight hand to hand.</span></li>
<li><span>If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, we will be
servants to you: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, you
shall be servants, and shall serve us.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Philistine said: I have defied the bands of
Israel this day: Give me a man, and let him fight with me hand to
hand.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul and all the Israelites hearing these words of
the Philistine were dismayed, and greatly afraid.</span></li>
<li><span>Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem
Juda before mentioned, whose name was Isai, who had eight sons, and
was an old man in the days of Saul, and of great age among
men.</span></li>
<li><span>And his three eldest sons followed Saul to the battle:
and the names of his three sons that went to the battle, were Eliab
the firstborn, and the second Abinadab, and the third
Samma.</span></li>
<li><span>But David was the youngest. So the three eldest having
followed Saul,</span></li>
<li><span>David went, and returned from Saul, to feed his father's
flock at Bethlehem.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the Philistine came out morning and evening, and
presented himself forty days.</span></li>
<li><span>And Isai said to David his son: Take for thy brethren an
ephi of frumenty, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy
brethren.</span></li>
<li><span>And carry these ten little cheeses to the tribune: and go
see thy brethren, if they are well: and learn with whom they are
placed.</span></li>
<li><span>But Saul, and they, and all the children of Israel were
in the valley of Terebinth fighting against the
Philistines.</span></li>
<li><span>David therefore arose in the morning, and gave the charge
of the flock to the keeper: and went away loaded as Isai had
commanded him. And he came to the place of Magala, and to the army,
which was going out to fight, and shouted for the
battle.</span></li>
<li><span>For Israel had put themselves in array, and the
Philistines who stood against them were prepared.</span></li>
<li><span>And David leaving the vessels which he had brought, under
the care of the keeper of the baggage, ran to the place of the
battle and asked if all things went well with his
brethren.</span></li>
<li><span>And as he talked with them, that baseborn man whose name
was Goliath, the Philistine, of Geth, shewed himself coming up from
the camp of the Philistines: and he spoke according to the same
words, and David heard them.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the Israelites when they saw the man, fled from
his face, fearing him exceedingly.</span></li>
<li><span>And some one of Israel said: Have you seen this man that
is come up, for he is come up to defy Israel. And the man that
shall slay him, the king will enrich with great riches, and will
give him his daughter, and will make his father's house free from
tribute in Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying:
What shall be given to the man that shall kill this Philistine, and
shall take away the reproach from Israel? for who is this
uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the
living God?</span></li>
<li><span>And the people answered him the same words saying: These
things shall be given to the man that shall slay him.</span></li>
<li><span>Now when Eliab his eldest brother heard this, when he was
speaking with others, he was angry with David, and said: Why
earnest thou hither? and why didst thou leave those few sheep in
the desert? I know thy pride, and the wickedness of thy heart: that
thou art come down to see the battle.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said: What have I done? is there not cause to
speak?</span></li>
<li><span>And he turned a little aside from him to another: and
said the same word. And the people answered him as
before.</span></li>
<li><span>And the words which David spoke were heard, and were
rehearsed before Saul.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he was brought to him, he said to him: Let not
any man's heart be dismayed in him: I thy servant will go, and will
fight against the Philistine.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said to David: Thou art not able to withstand
this Philistine, nor to fight against him: for thou art but a boy,
but he is a warrior from his youth.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to Saul: Thy servant kept his father's
sheep, and there came a lion, or a bear, and took a ram out of the
midst of the flock:</span></li>
<li><span>And I pursued after them, and struck them, and delivered
it out of their mouth: and they rose up against me, and I caught
them by the throat, and I strangled and killed them.</span></li>
<li><span>For I thy servant have killed both a lion and a bear: and
this uncircumcised Philistine shall be also as one of them. I will
go now, and take away the reproach of the people: for who is this
uncircumcised Philistine, who hath dared to curse the army of the
living God?</span></li>
<li><span>And David said: The Lord who delivered me out of the paw
of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out
of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said to David: Go, and the
Lord be with thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul clothed David with his garments, and put a
helmet of brass upon his head, and armed him with a coat of
mail.</span></li>
<li><span>And David having girded his sword upon his armour, began
to try if he could walk in armour: for he was not accustomed to it.
And David said to Saul: I cannot go thus, for I am not used to it.
And he laid them off,</span></li>
<li><span>And he took his staff, which he had always in his hands:
and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them
into the shepherd's scrip, which he had with him, and he took a
sling in his hand, and went forth against the
Philistine.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Philistine came on, and drew nigh against David,
and his armourbearer before him.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the Philistine looked, and beheld David, he
despised him. For he was a young man, ruddy, and of a comely
countenance.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Philistine said to David: Am I a dog, that thou
comest to me with a staff? And the Philistine cursed David by his
gods.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to David: Come to me, and I will give thy
flesh to the birds of the air, and to the beasts of the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to the Philistine: Thou comest to me with
a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in
the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel,
which thou hast defied.</span></li>
<li><span>This day, and the Lord will deliver thee into my hand,
and I will slay thee, and take away thy head from thee: and I will
give the carcasses of the army of the Philistines this day to the
birds of the air, and to the beasts of the earth: that all the
earth may know that there is a God in Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And all this assembly shall know, that the Lord saveth
not with sword and spear: for it is his battle, and he will deliver
you into our hands.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the Philistine arose and was coming, and drew
nigh to meet David, David made haste, and ran to the fight to meet
the Philistine.</span></li>
<li><span>And he put his hand into his scrip, and took a stone, and
cast it with the sling, and fetching it about struck the Philistine
in the forehead: and the stone was fixed in his forehead, and he
fell on his face upon the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And David prevailed over the Philistine, with a sling and
a stone, and he struck, and slew the Philistine. And as David had
no sword in his hand,</span></li>
<li><span>He ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his
sword, and drew it out of the sheath, and slew him, and cut off his
head. And the Philistines seeing that their champion was dead, fled
away.</span></li>
<li><span>And the men of Israel and Juda rising up shouted, and
pursued after the Philistines till they came to the valley and to
the gates of Accaron, and there fell many wounded of the
Philistines in the way of Saraim, and as far as Geth, and as far as
Accaron.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of Israel returning, after they had
pursued the Philistines, fell upon their camp.</span></li>
<li><span>And David taking the head of the Philistine brought it to
Jerusalem: but his armour he put in his tent.</span></li>
<li><span>Now at the time that Saul saw David going out against the
Philistines, he said to Abner the captain of the army: Of what
family is this young man descended, Abner? And Abner said: As thy
soul liveth, O king, I know not.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said: Inquire thou, whose son this man
is.</span></li>
<li><span>And when David was returned, after the Philistine was
slain, Abner took him, and brought him in before Saul, with the
head of the Philistine in his hand.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said to him: Young man, of what family art thou?
And David said: I am the son of thy servant Isai the
Bethlehemite.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="18">1 Samuel 18</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking
to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and
Jonathan loved him as his own soul.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul took him that day, and would not let him return
to his father's house.</span></li>
<li><span>And David and Jonathan made a covenant, for be loved him
as his own soul.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jonathan stripped himself of the coat with which he
was clothed, and gave it to David, and the rest of his garments,
even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.</span></li>
<li><span>And David went out to whatsoever business Saul sent him,
and he behaved himself prudently: and Saul set him over the
soldiers, and he was acceptable in the eyes of all the people, and
especially in the eyes of Saul's servants.</span></li>
<li><span>Now when David returned, after be slew the Philistine,
the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and
dancing, to meet king Saul, with timbrels of joy, and
cornets.</span></li>
<li><span>And the women sung as they played, and they said: I Saul
slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul was exceeding angry, and this word was
displeasing in his eyes, and he said: They have given David ten
thousands, and to me they have given but a thousand; what can he
have more but the kingdom?</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul did not look on David with a good eye from that
day and forward.</span></li>
<li><span>And the day after the evil spirit from God came upon
Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of his house. And David played
with his hand as at other times. And Saul held a spear in his
hand,</span></li>
<li><span>And threw it, thinking to nail David to the wall: and
David stept aside out of his presence twice.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul feared David, because the Lord was with him, and
was departed from himself.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him a
captain over a thousand men, and he went out and came in before the
people.</span></li>
<li><span>And David behaved wisely in all his ways, and the Lord
was with him.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul saw that he was exceeding prudent, and began to
beware of him.</span></li>
<li><span>But all Israel and Juda loved David, for he came in and
went out before them.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said to David: Behold my elder daughter Merob,
her will I give thee to wife: only be a valiant man, and fight the
battles of the Lord. Now Saul said within himself: Let not my hand
be upon him, but let the hands of the Philistines be upon
him.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to Saul: Who am I, or what is my life, or
my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law of the
king?</span></li>
<li><span>And it came to pass at the time when Merob the daughter
of Saul should have been given to David, that she was given to
Hadriel the Molathite to wife.</span></li>
<li><span>But Michol the other daughter of Saul loved David. And it
was told Saul, and it pleased him.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said: I will give her to him, that she may be a
stumblingblock to him, and that the band of the Philistines may be
upon him. And Saul said to David: In two things thou shalt be my
son in law this day.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul commanded his servants to speak to David
privately, saying: Behold thou pleasest the king, and all his
servants love thee. Now therefore be the king's son in
law.</span></li>
<li><span>And the servants of Saul spoke all these words in the
ears of David. And David said: Doth it seem to you a small matter
to be the king's son in law? But I am a poor man, and of small
ability.</span></li>
<li><span>And the servants of Saul told him, saying: Such words as
these hath David spoken.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said: Speak thus to David: The king desireth not
any dowry, but only a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be
avenged of the king's enemies. Now Saul thought to deliver David
into the hands of the Philistines.</span></li>
<li><span>And when his servants had told David the words that Saul
had said, the word was pleasing in the eyes of David to be the
king's son in law.</span></li>
<li><span>And after a few days David rose up, and went with the men
that were under him, and he slew of the Philistines two hundred
men, and brought their foreskins and numbered them out to the king,
that he might be his son in law. Saul therefore gave him Michol his
daughter to wife.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul saw, and understood that the Lord was with
David. And Michol the daughter of Saul loved him.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul began to fear David more: and Saul became
David's enemy continually.</span></li>
<li><span>And the princes of the Philistines went forth: and from
the beginning of their going forth, David behaved himself more
wisely than all the servants of Saul, and his name became very
famous.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="19">1 Samuel 19</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son and to all his
servants, that they should kill David. But Jonathan the son of Saul
loved David exceedingly.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jonathan told David, saying: Saul my father seeketh
to kill thee: wherefore look to thyself, I beseech thee, in the
morning, and thou shalt abide in a secret place and shalt be
hid.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field
where thou art: and I will speak of thee to my father, and
whatsoever I shall see, I will tell thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jonathan spoke good things of David to Saul his
father: and said to him: Sin not, O king, against thy servant,
David, because he hath not sinned against thee, and his works are
very good towards thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And he put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine,
and the Lord wrought great salvation for all Israel. Thou sawest it
and didst rejoice. Why therefore wilt thou sin against innocent
blood by killing David, who is without fault?</span></li>
<li><span>And when Saul heard this he was appeased with the words
of Jonathan, and swore: As the Lord liveth he shall not be
slain.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Jonathan called David and told him all these words:
and Jonathan brought in David to Saul, and he was before him, as he
had been yesterday and the day before.</span></li>
<li><span>And the war began again, and David went out and fought
against the Philistines, and defeated them with a great slaughter,
and they fled from his face.</span></li>
<li><span>And the evil spirit from the Lord came upon Saul, and he
sat in his house, and held a spear in his hand: and David played
with his hand.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul endeavoured to nail David to the wall with his
spear. And David slipt away out of the presence of Saul: and the
spear missed him, and was fastened in the wall, and David fled and
escaped that night.</span></li>
<li><span>Saul therefore sent his guards to David's house to watch
him, that he might be killed in the morning. And when Michol
David's wife had told him this, saying: Unless thou save thyself
this night, to morrow thou wilt die,</span></li>
<li><span>She let him down through a window. And he went and fled
away and escaped.</span></li>
<li><span>And Michol took an image and laid it on the bed, and put
a goat's skin with the hair at the head of it, and covered it with
clothes.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul sent officers to seize David: and it was
answered that he was sick.</span></li>
<li><span>And again Saul sent to see David, saying: Bring him to me
in the bed, that he may be slain.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the messengers were come in, they found an image
upon the bed, and a goat's skin at its head.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said to Michol: Why hast thou deceived me so,
and let my enemy go and flee away? And Michol answered Saul:
Because he said to me: Let me go, or else I will kill
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>But David fled and escaped, and came to Samuel in
Ramatha, and told him all that Saul had done to him: and he and
Samuel went and dwelt in Najoth.</span></li>
<li><span>And it was told Saul by some, saying: Behold David is in
Najoth in Ramatha.</span></li>
<li><span>So Saul sent officers to take David: and when they saw a
company of prophets prophesying, and Samuel presiding over them,
the spirit of the Lord came also upon them, and they likewise began
to prophesy.</span></li>
<li><span>And when this was told Saul, he sent other messengers:
but they also prophesied. And again Saul sent messengers the third
time: and they prophesied also. And Saul being exceedingly
angry,</span></li>
<li><span>Went also himself to Ramatha, and came as far as the
great cistern, which is in Socho, and he asked, and said: In what
place are Samuel and David? And it was told him: Behold they axe in
Najoth in Ramatha.</span></li>
<li><span>And he went to Najoth in Ramatha, and the spirit of the
Lord came upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied till he
came to Najoth in Ramatha.</span></li>
<li><span>And he stripped himself also of his garments, and
prophesied with the rest before Samuel, and lay down naked all that
day and night. This gave occasion to a proverb: What! is Saul too
among the prophets?</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="20">1 Samuel 20</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>But David fled from Najoth, which is in Ramatha, and came
and said to Jonathan: What have I done? what is my iniquity, and
what is my sin against thy father, that he seeketh my
life?</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to him: God forbid, thou shalt not die: for
my father will do nothing great or little, without first telling
me: hath then my father hid this word only from me? no, this shall
not be.</span></li>
<li><span>And he swore again to David. And David said: Thy father
certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, and he will
say: Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved. But truly as
the Lord liveth, and thy soul liveth, there is but one step (as I
may say) between me and death.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jonathan said to David: Whatsoever thy soul shall say
to me, I will do for thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to Jonathan: Behold to morrow is the new
moon, and I according to custom am wont to sit beside the king to
eat: let me go then that I may be hid in the field till the evening
of the third day.</span></li>
<li><span>If thy father look and inquire for me, thou shalt answer
him: David asked me that he might run to Bethlehem his own city:
because there are solemn sacrifices there for all his
tribe.</span></li>
<li><span>If he shall say, It is well: thy servant shall have
peace: but if he be angry, know that his malice is come to its
height.</span></li>
<li><span>Deal mercifully then with thy servant: for thou hast
brought me thy servant into a covenant of the Lord with thee. But
if there be any iniquity in me, do thou kill me, and bring me not
in to thy father.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jonathan said: Far be this from thee: for if I should
certainly know that evil is determined by my father against thee, I
could do no otherwise than tell thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And David answered Jonathan: Who shall bring me word, if
thy father should answer thee harshly concerning me?</span></li>
<li><span>And Jonathan said to David: Come and let us go out into
the field. And when they were both of them gone out into the
field,</span></li>
<li><span>Jonathan said to David: O Lord God of Israel, if I shall
discover my father's mind, to morrow or the day after, and there be
any thing good for David, and I send not immediately to thee, and
make it known to thee,</span></li>
<li><span>May the Lord do so and so to Jonathan and add still more.
But if my father shall continue in malice against thee, I will
discover it to thy ear, and will send thee away, that thou mayest
go in peace, and the Lord be with thee, as he hath been with my
father.</span></li>
<li><span>And if I live, thou shalt shew me the kindness of the
Lord: but if I die,</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt not take away thy kindness from my house for
ever, when the Lord shall have rooted out the enemies of David,
every one of them from the earth, may he take away Jonathan from
his house, and may the Lord require it at the hands of David's
enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>Jonathan therefore made a covenant with the house of
David: and the Lord required it at the hands of David's
enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jonathan swore again to David, because he loved him:
for he loved him as his own soul.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jonathan said to him: To morrow is the new moon, and
thou wilt be missed:</span></li>
<li><span>For thy seat will be empty till after tomorrow. So thou
shalt go down quickly, and come to the place, where thou must be
hid on the day when it is lawful to work, and thou shalt remain
beside the stone, which is called Ezel.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will shoot three arrows near it, and will shoot as
if I were exercising myself at a mark.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will send a boy, saying to him: Go and fetch me the
arrows.</span></li>
<li><span>If I shall say to the boy: Behold the arrows are on this
side of thee, take them up: come thou to me, because, there is
peace to thee, and there is no evil, as the Lord liveth. But if I
shall speak thus to the boy: Behold the arrows are beyond thee: go
in peace, for the Lord hath sent thee away.</span></li>
<li><span>And concerning the word which I and thou have spoken, the
Lord be between thee and me for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>So David was hid in the field, and the new moon came, and
the king sat down to eat bread.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the king sat down upon his chair (according to
custom) which was beside the wall, Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by
Saul's side, and David's place appeared empty.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said nothing that day, for he thought it might
have happened to him, that he was not clean, nor
purified.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the second day after the new moon was come,
David's place appeared empty again. And Saul said to Jonathan his
son: Why cometh not the son of Isai to meat neither yesterday nor
to day?</span></li>
<li><span>And Jonathan answered Saul: He asked leave of me
earnestly to go to Bethlehem,</span></li>
<li><span>And he said: Let me go, for there is a solemn sacrifice
in the city, one of my brethren hath sent for me: and now if I have
found favour in thy eyes, I will go quickly, and see my brethren.
For this cause he came not to the king's table.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Saul being angry against Jonathan said to him: Thou
son of a woman that is the ravisher of a man, do I not know that
thou lovest the son of Isai to thy own confusion and to the
confusion of thy shameless mother?</span></li>
<li><span>For as long as the son of Isai liveth upon earth, thou
shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Therefore now presently
send, and fetch him to me: for he is the son of death.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jonathan answering Saul his father, said: Why shall
he die: what hath he done?</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul caught up a spear to strike him. And Jonathan
understood that it was determined by his father to kill
David.</span></li>
<li><span>So Jonathan rose from the table in great anger, and did
not eat bread on the second day after the new moon. For he was
grieved for David, because his father had put him to
confusion.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the morning came, Jonathan went into the field,
according to the appointment with David, and a little boy with
him.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to his boy: Go, and fetch me the arrows which
I shoot. And when the boy ran, he shot another arrow beyond the
boy.</span></li>
<li><span>The boy therefore came to the place of the arrow which
Jonathan had shot: and Jonathan cried after the boy, and said:
Behold the arrow is there further beyond thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jonathan cried again after the boy, saying: Make
haste speedily, stand not. And Jonathan's boy gathered up the
arrows, and brought them to his master:</span></li>
<li><span>And he knew not at all what was doing: for only Jonathan
and David knew the matter.</span></li>
<li><span>Jonathan therefore gave his arms to the boy, and said to
him: Go, and carry them into the city.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the boy was gone, David rose out of his place,
which was towards the south, and falling on his face to the ground,
adored thrice: and kissing one another, they wept together, but
David more.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jonathan said to David: Go in peace: and let all
stand that we have sworn both of us in the name of the Lord,
saying: The Lord be between me and thee, and between my seed and
thy seed for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>And David arose, and departed: and Jonathan went into the
city.</span></li>

</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="21">1 Samuel 21</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And David came to Nobe to Achimelech the priest: and
Achimelech was astonished at David's coming. And he said to him:
Why art thou alone, and no man with thee?</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to Achimelech the priest: The king hath
commanded me a business, and said: Let no man know the thing for
which thou art sent by me, and what manner of commands I have given
thee: and I have appointed my servants to such and such a
place.</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore if thou have any thing at hand, though it
were but five loaves, give me, or whatsoever thou canst
find.</span></li>
<li><span>And the priest answered David, saying: I have no common
bread at hand, but only holy bread, if the young men be clean,
especially from women?</span></li>
<li><span>And David answered the priest, and said to him: Truly, as
to what concerneth women, we have refrained ourselves from
yesterday and the day before, when we came out, and the vessels of
the young men were holy. Now this way is defiled, but it shall also
be sanctified this day in the vessels.</span></li>
<li><span>The priest therefore gave him hallowed bread: for there
was no bread there, but only the loaves of proposition, which had
been taken away from before the face of the Lord, that hot loaves
might be set up.</span></li>
<li><span>Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that
day, within the tabernacle of the Lord: and his name was Doeg, an
Edomite, the chiefest of Saul's herdsmen.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to Achimelech: Hast thou here at hand a
spear, or a sword? for I brought not my own sword, nor my own
weapons with me, for the king's business required
haste.</span></li>
<li><span>And the priest said: Lo, here is the sword of Goliath the
Philistine whom thou slewest in the valley of Terebinth, wrapped up
in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take this, take it, for
here is no other but this. And David said: There is none like that,
give it me.</span></li>
<li><span>And David arose and fled that day from the face of Saul:
and came to Achis the king of Geth:</span></li>
<li><span>And the servants of Achis, when they saw David, said to
him: Is not this David the king of the land? Did they not sing to
him in their dances, saying: Saul hath slain his thousands, and
David his ten thousands?</span></li>
<li><span>But David laid up these words in his heart, and was
exceedingly afraid at the face of Achis the king of
Geth.</span></li>
<li><span>And he changed his countenance before them, and slipt
down between their hands: and he stumbled against the doors of the
gate, and his spittle ran down upon his beard.</span></li>
<li><span>And Achis said to his servants: You saw the man was mad:
why have you brought him to me?</span></li>
<li><span>Have we need of madmen, that you have brought in this
fellow, to play the madman in my presence? shall this fellow come
into my house?</span></li>

<li><span>David therefore went from thence and fled to the cave of
Odollam. And when his brethren, and all his father's house had
heard of it, they went down to him thither;</span></li>
<li><span>And all that were in distress and oppressed with debt,
and under affliction of mind gathered themselves unto him: and he
became their prince, and there were with him about four hundred
men.</span></li>
<li><span>And David departed from thence into Maspha of Moab: and
he said to the king of Moab: Let my father and my mother tarry with
you, I beseech thee, till I know what God will do for
me.</span></li>
<li><span>And he left them under the eyes of the king of Moab, and
they abode with him all the days that David was in the
hold.</span></li>
<li><span>And Gad the prophet said to David: Abide not in the hold,
depart, and go into the land of Juda. And David departed, and came
into the forest of Haret.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul heard that David was seen, and the men that were
with him. Now whilst Saul abode in Gabaa, and was in the wood,
which is by Rama, having his spear in his hand, and all his
servants were standing about him,</span></li>
<li><span>He said to his servants that stood about him: Hear me
now, ye sons of Jemini: will the son of Isai give everyone of you
fields, and vineyards, and make you all tribunes, and
centurions:</span></li>
<li><span>That all of you have conspired against me, and there is
no one to inform me, especially when even my son hath entered into
league with the soil of Isai? There is not one of you that pitieth
my case, nor that giveth me any information: because my son hath
raised up my servant against me, plotting against me to this
day.</span></li>
<li><span>And Doeg the Edomite who stood by, and was the chief
among the servants of Saul, answering, said: I saw the son of Isai,
in Nobe with Achimelech the son of Achitob the priest.</span></li>
<li><span>And he consulted the Lord for him, and gave him victuals,
and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.</span></li>
<li><span>Then the king sent to call for Achimelech the priest the
son of Achitob, and all his father's house, the priests that were
in Nobe, and they came all of them to the king.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said to Achimelech: Hear, thou son of Achitob.
He answered: Here I am, my lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said to him: Why have you conspired against me,
thou, and the son of Isai, and thou hast given him bread and a
sword, and hast consulted the Lord for him, that he should rise up
against me, continuing a traitor to this day.</span></li>
<li><span>And Achimelech answering the king, said: And who amongst
all thy servants is so faithful as David, who is the king's son in
law, and goeth forth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thy
house?</span></li>
<li><span>Did I begin to day to consult the Lord for him? far be
this from me: let not the king suspect such a thing against his
servant, or any one in all my father's house: for thy servant knew
nothing of this matter, either little or great.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said: Dying thou shalt die, Achimelech, thou
and all thy father's house.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said to the messengers that stood about him:
Turn, and kill the priests of the Lord, for their hand is with
David, because they knew that he was fled, and they told it not to
me. And the king's servants would not put forth their hands against
the priests of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said to Doeg: Turn thou, and fall upon the
priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and fell upon the priests and
slew in that day eighty-five men that wore the linen
ephod.</span></li>
<li><span>And Nobe the city of the priests he smote with the edge
of his sword, both men and women, children, and sucklings, and ox
and ass, and sheep with the edge of the sword.</span></li>
<li><span>But one of the sons of Achimelech the son of Achitob,
whose name was Abiathar, escaped, and fled to David,</span></li>
<li><span>And told him that Saul had slain the priests of the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to Abiathar: I knew that day when Doeg the
Edomite was there, that without doubt he would tell Saul: I have
been the occasion of the death of all the souls of thy father's
house.</span></li>
<li><span>Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my
life, seeketh thy life also, and with me thou shalt be
saved.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="23">1 Samuel 23</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And they told David, saying: Behold the Philistines fight
against Ceila, and they rob the barns.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore David consulted the Lord, saying: Shall I go
and smite these Philistines? And the Lord said to David: Go, and
thou shalt smite the Philistines, and shalt save Ceila.</span></li>
<li><span>And the men that were with David, said to him: Behold we
are in fear here in Judea, how much more if we go to Ceila against
the hands of the Philistines?</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore David consulted the Lord again. And he answered
and said to him: Arise, and go to Ceila: for I will deliver the
Philistines into thy hand.</span></li>
<li><span>David therefore, and his men, went to Ceila, and fought
against the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and made a
great slaughter of them: and David saved the inhabitants of
Ceila.</span></li>
<li><span>Now at that time, when Abiathar the son of Achimelech
fled to David to Ceila, he came down having an ephod with
him.</span></li>
<li><span>And it was told Saul that David was come to Ceila: and
Saul said: The Lord hath delivered him into my hands, and he is
shut up, being come into a city, that hath gates and
bars.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul commanded all the people to go down to fight
against Ceila, and to besiege David, and his men.</span></li>
<li><span>Now when David understood, that Saul secretly prepared
evil against him, he said to Abiathar the priest: Bring hither the
ephod.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said: O Lord God of Israel, thy servant hath
heard a report, that Saul designeth to come to Ceila, to destroy
the city for my sake:</span></li>
<li><span>Will the men of Ceila deliver me into his hands? and will
Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O Lord God of Israel,
tell thy servant. And the Lord said: He will come down.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said: Will the men of Ceila deliver me, and my
men, into the hands of Saul? And the Lord said: They will deliver
thee up.</span></li>
<li><span>Then David and his men, who were about six hundred,
arose, and departing from Ceila, wandered up and down uncertain
where they should stay: and it was told Saul that David was fled
from Ceila, and had escaped: wherefore he forbore to go
out.</span></li>
<li><span>But David abode in the desert in strong holds, and he
remained in a mountain of the desert of Ziph, in a woody hill. And
Saul sought him always: but the Lord delivered him not into his
hands.</span></li>
<li><span>And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life.
And David was in the desert of Ziph, in a wood.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jonathan the son of Saul arose, and went to David
into the wood, and strengthened his hands in God: and he said to
him:</span></li>
<li><span>Fear not: for the hand of my father Saul shall not find
thee, and thou shalt reign over Israel, and I shall be next to
thee, yea, and my father knoweth this.</span></li>
<li><span>And the two made a covenant before the Lord: and David
abode in the wood: but Jonathan returned to his house.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Ziphites went up to Saul in Gabaa, saying: Lo,
doth not David lie hid with us in the strong holds of the wood, in
mount Hachila, which is on the right hand of the
desert.</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore come down, as thy soul hath desired to come
down: and it shall be our business to deliver him into the king's
hands.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said: Blessed be ye of the Lord, for you have
pitied my case.</span></li>
<li><span>Go therefore, I pray you, and use all diligence, and
curiously inquire, and consider the place where his foot is, and
who hath seen him there: for he thinketh of me, that I lie craftily
in wait for him.</span></li>
<li><span>Consider and see all his lurking holes, wherein he is
bid, and return to me with the certainty of the thing, that I may
go with you. And if be should even go down into the earth to hide
himself, I will search him out in all the thousands of
Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>And they arose and went to Ziph before Saul: and David
and his men were in the desert of Maon, in the plain at the right
hand of Jesimon.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Saul and his men went to seek him: and it was told
David, and forthwith he went down to the rock, and abode in the
wilderness of Maon: and when Saul had heard of it he pursued after
David in the wilderness of Maon.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul went on this side of the mountain: and David and
his men were on the other side of the mountain: and David despaired
of being able to escape from the face of Saul: and Saul and his men
encompassed David and his men round about to take them.</span></li>
<li><span>And a messenger came to Saul, saying: Make haste to come,
for the Philistines have poured in themselves upon the
land.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore Saul returned, leaving the pursuit of David,
and went to meet the Philistines. For this cause they called that
place, the Rock of division.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="24">1 Samuel 24</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Then David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds
of Engaddi.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Saul was returned from following the
Philistines, they told him, saying: Behold, David is in the desert
of Engaddi.</span></li>
<li><span>Saul therefore took three thousand chosen men out of all
Israel, and went out to seek after David, and his men, even upon
the most craggy rocks, which are accessible only to wild
goats.</span></li>
<li><span>And he came to the sheepcotes, which were in his way. And
there was a cave, into which Saul went, to ease nature: now David
and his men lay hid in the inner part of the cave.</span></li>
<li><span>And the servants of David said to him: Behold the day, of
which the Lord said to thee: I will deliver thy enemy unto thee,
that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good in thy eyes. Then
David arose, and secretly cut off the hem of Saul's
robe.</span></li>
<li><span>After which David's heart struck him, because he had cut
off the hem of Saul's robe.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to his men: The Lord be merciful unto me,
that I may do no such thing to my master the Lord's anointed, as to
lay my hand upon him, because he is the Lord's
anointed.</span></li>
<li><span>And David stopped his men with his words, and suffered
them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rising up out of the cave,
went on his way.</span></li>
<li><span>And David also rose up after him: and going out of the
cave cried after Saul, saying: My lord the king. And Saul looked
behind him: and David bowing himself down to the ground,
worshipped,</span></li>
<li><span>And said to Saul: Why dost thou hear the words of men
that say David seeketh thy hurt?</span></li>
<li><span>Behold this day thy eyes have seen, that the Lord hath
delivered thee into my hand, in the cave, and I had a thought to
kill thee, but my eye hath spared thee. For I said: I will not put
out my hand against my lord, because he is the Lord's
anointed.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover see and know, O my father, the hem of thy robe
in my hand, that when I cut, off the hem of thy robe, I would not
put out my hand against thee. Reflect, and see, that there is no
evil in my hand, nor iniquity, neither have I sinned against thee:
but thou liest in wait for my life, to take it away.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord judge between me and thee, and the Lord revenge
me of thee: but my hand shall not be upon thee.</span></li>
<li><span>As also it is said in the old proverb: From the wicked
shall wickedness come forth: therefore my hand shall not be upon
thee. After whom dost thou come out, O king of Israel?</span></li>
<li><span>After whom dost thou pursue? After a dead dog, after a
flea.</span></li>
<li><span>Be the Lord judge, and judge between me and thee, and
see, and judge my cause, and deliver me out of thy
hand.</span></li>
<li><span>And when David had made an end of speaking these words to
Saul, Saul said: Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted
up his voice, and wept.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to David: Thou art more just than I: for thou
hast done good to me, and I have rewarded thee with
evil.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou hast shewn this day what good things thou hast
done to me: how the Lord delivered me into thy hand, and thou hast
not killed me.</span></li>
<li><span>For who when he hath found his enemy, will let him go
well away? But the Lord reward thee for this good turn, for what
thou hast done to me this day.</span></li>
<li><span>And now as I know that thou shalt surely be king, and
have the kingdom of Israel in thy hand:</span></li>
<li><span>Swear to me by the Lord, that thou wilt not destroy my
seed after me, nor take away my name from the house of my
father.</span></li>
<li><span>And David swore to Saul. So Saul went home: and David and
his men went up into safer places.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="25">1 Samuel 25</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And Samuel died, and all Israel was gathered together,
and they mourned for him, and buried him in his house in Ramatha.
And David rose and went down into the wilderness of
Pharan.</span></li>
<li><span>Now there was a certain man in the wilderness of Maon,
and his possessions were in Carmel, and the man was very great: and
he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and it happened
that he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the name of the man was Nabal: and the name of his
wife was Abigail. And she was a prudent and very comely woman, but
her husband was churlish, and very bad and ill natured: and he was
of the house of Caleb.</span></li>
<li><span>And when David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was
shearing his sheep,</span></li>
<li><span>He sent ten young men, and said to them: Go up to Carmel,
and go to Nabal, and salute him in my name with peace.</span></li>
<li><span>And you shall say: Peace be to my brethren, and to thee,
and peace to thy house, and peace to all that thou
hast.</span></li>
<li><span>I heard that thy shepherds that were with us in the
desert were shearing: we never molested them, neither was there
ought missing to them of the flock at any time, all the while they
were with us in Carmel.</span></li>
<li><span>Ask thy servants, and they will tell thee. Now therefore
let thy servants find favour in thy eyes: for we are come in a good
day, whatsoever thy hand shall find give to thy servants, and to
thy son David.</span></li>
<li><span>And when David's servants came, they spoke to Nabal all
these words in David's name: and then held their peace.</span></li>
<li><span>But Nabal answering the servants of David, said: Who is
David? and what is the son of Isai? servants are multiplied now a
days who flee from their masters.</span></li>
<li><span>Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and the flesh
of my cattle, which I have killed for my shearers, and give to men
whom I know not whence they are?</span></li>
<li><span>So the servants of David went back their way, and
returning came and told him all the words that he said.</span></li>
<li><span>Then David said to his young men: Let every man gird on
his sword. And they girded on every man his sword. And David also
girded on his sword: and there followed David about four hundred
men: and two hundred remained with the baggage.</span></li>
<li><span>But one of the servants told Abigail the wife of Nabal,
saying: Behold David sent messengers out of the wilderness, to
salute our master: and he rejected them.</span></li>
<li><span>These men were very good to us, and gave us no trouble:
neither did we ever lose any thing all the time that we conversed
with them in the desert.</span></li>
<li><span>They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the
while we were with them keeping the sheep.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore consider, and think what thou hast to do: for
evil is determined against thy husband, and against thy house, and
he is a son of Belial, so that no man can speak to him.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves, and
two vessels of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five
measures of parched corn, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and
two hundred cakes of dry figs, and laid them upon
asses:</span></li>
<li><span>And she said to her servants: Go before me: behold I will
follow after you: but she told not her husband Nabal.</span></li>
<li><span>And when she had gotten upon an ass, and was coming down
to the foot of the mountain, David and his men came down over
against her, and she met them.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said: Truly in vain have I kept all that
belonged to this man in the wilderness, and nothing was lost of all
that pertained unto him: and he hath returned me evil for
good.</span></li>
<li><span>May God do so and so, and add more to the foes of David,
if I leave of all that belong to him till the morning, any that
pisseth against the wall.</span></li>
<li><span>And when Abigail saw David she made haste and lighted off
the ass, and fell before David, on her face, and adored upon the
ground.</span></li>
<li><span>And she fell at his feet, and said: Upon me let this
iniquity be, my lord: let thy handmaid speak, I beseech thee, in
thy ears: and hear the words of thy servant.</span></li>
<li><span>Let not my lord the king, I pray, regard this naughty man
Nabal: for according to his name, he is a fool, and folly is with
him: but I thy handmaid did not see thy servants, my lord, whom
thou sentest.</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore, my lord, the Lord liveth, and thy soul
liveth, who hath withholden thee from coming to blood, and hath
saved thy hand to thee: and now let thy enemies be as Nabal, and
all they that seek evil to my lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore receive this blessing, which thy handmaid hath
brought to thee, my lord: and give it to the young men that follow
thee, my lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Forgive the iniquity of thy handmaid: for the Lord will
surely make for my lord a faithful house, because thou, my lord,
fightest the battles of the Lord: let not evil therefore be found
in thee all the days of thy life.</span></li>
<li><span>For if a man at any time shall rise, and persecute thee,
and seek thy life, the soul of my lord shall be kept, as in the
bundle of the living, with the Lord thy God: but the souls of thy
enemies shall be whirled, as with the violence and whirling of a
sling.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the Lord shall have done to thee, my lord, all
the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have made
thee prince over Israel,</span></li>
<li><span>This shall not be an occasion of grief to thee, and a
scruple of heart to my lord, that thou hast shed innocent blood, or
hast revenged thyself: and when the Lord shall have done well by my
lord, thou shalt remember thy handmaid.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to Abigail: Blessed be the Lord the God of
Israel, who sent thee this day to meet me, and blessed be thy
speech:</span></li>
<li><span>And blessed be thou, who hast kept me to day, from coming
to blood, and revenging me with my own hand.</span></li>
<li><span>Otherwise as the Lord liveth the God of Israel, who hath
withholden me from doing thee any evil: if thou hadst not quickly
come to meet me, there had not been left to Nabal by the morning
light any that pisseth against the wall.</span></li>
<li><span>And David received at her hand all that she had brought
him, and said to her: Go in peace into thy house, behold I have
heard thy voice, and have honoured thy face.</span></li>
<li><span>And Abigail came to Nabal: and behold he had a feast in
his house, like the feast of a king, and Nabal's heart was merry:
for he was very drunk: and she told him nothing less or more until
morning.</span></li>
<li><span>But early in the morning when Nabal had digested his
wine, his wife told him these words, and his heart died within him,
and he became as a stone.</span></li>
<li><span>And after ten days had passed, the Lord struck Nabal, and
he died.</span></li>
<li><span>And when David had heard that Nabal was dead, he said:
Blessed be the Lord, who hath judged the cause of my reproach at
the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil, and the
Lord hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his head. The n
David sent and treated with Abigail, that he might take her to
himself for a wife.</span></li>
<li><span>And David's servants came to Abigail to Carmel, and spoke
to her, saying: David hath sent us to thee, to take thee to himself
for a wife.</span></li>
<li><span>And she arose and bowed herself down with her face to the
earth, and said: Behold, let thy servant be a handmaid, to wash the
feet of the servants of my lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And Abigail arose, and made haste, and got upon an ass,
and five damsels went with her, her waiting maids, and she followed
the messengers of David, and became his wife.</span></li>
<li><span>Moreover David took also Achinoam of Jezrahel: and they
were both of them his wives.</span></li>
<li><span>But Saul gave Michol his daughter, David's wife, to
Phalti, the son of Lais, who was of Gallium.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="26">1 Samuel 26</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And the men of Ziph came to Saul in Gabaa, saying: Behold
David is hid in the hill of Hachila, which is over against the
wilderness.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph,
having with him three thousand chosen men of Israel, to seek David
in the wilderness of Ziph.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul encamped in Gabaa Hachila, which was over
against the wilderness in the way: and David abode in the
wilderness. And seeing that Saul was come after him into the
wilderness,</span></li>
<li><span>He sent spies, and learned that he was most certainly
come thither.</span></li>
<li><span>And David arose secretly, and came to the place where
Saul was: and when he had beheld the place, wherein Saul slept, and
Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his army, and Saul sleeping in
a tent, and the rest of the multitude round about him,</span></li>
<li><span>David spoke to Achimelech the Hethite, and Abisai the son
of Sarvia the brother of Joab, saying: Who will go down with me to
Saul into the camp? And Abisai said: I will go with
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>So David and Abisai came to the people by night, and
found Saul lying and sleeping in the tent, and his spear fixed in
the ground at his head: and Abner and the people sleeping round
about him.</span></li>
<li><span>And Abisai said to David: God hath shut up thy enemy this
day into thy hands: now then I will run him through with my spear
even to the earth at once, and there shall be no need of a second
time.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to Abisai: Kill him not: for who shall put
forth his hand against the Lord's anointed, and shall be
guiltless?</span></li>
<li><span>And David said: As the Lord liveth, unless the Lord shall
strike him, or his day shall come to die, or he shall go down to
battle and perish:</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord be merciful unto me, that I extend not my hand
upon the Lord's anointed. But now take the spear, which is at his
head, and the cup of water, and let us go.</span></li>
<li><span>So David took the spear, and the cup of water which was
at Saul's head, and they went away: and no man saw it, or knew it,
or awaked, but they were all asleep, for a deep sleep from the Lord
was fallen upon them.</span></li>
<li><span>And when David was gone over to the other side. and stood
on the top of the hill afar off, and a good space was between
them,</span></li>
<li><span>David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner,
saying: Wilt thou not answer, Abner? And Abner answering, said: Who
art thou, that criest, and disturbest the king?</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to Abner: Art not thou a man? and who is
like thee in Israel? why then hast thou not kept thy lord the king?
for there came one of the people in to kill the king thy
lord.</span></li>
<li><span>This thing is not good, that thou hast done: as the Lord
liveth, you are the sons of death, who have not kept your master,
the Lord's anointed. And now where is the king's spear, and the cup
of water, which was at his head?</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul knew David's voice, and said: Is this thy voice,
my son David? And David said: It is my voice, my lord the
king.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said: Wherefore doth my lord persecute his
servant? What have I done? or what evil is there in my
hand?</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore hear, I pray thee, my lord the king, the
words of thy servant: If the Lord stir thee up against me, let him
accept of sacrifice: but if the sons of men, they are cursed in the
sight of the Lord, who have cast me out this day, that I should not
dwell in the inheritance of the Lord, saying: Go, serve strange
gods.</span></li>
<li><span>And now let not my blood be shed upon the earth before
the Lord: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as the
partridge is hunted in the mountains.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said: I have sinned, return, my son David, for I
will no more do thee harm, because my life hath been precious in
thy eyes this day: for it appeareth that I have done foolishly, and
have been ignorant in very many things.</span></li>
<li><span>And David answering, said: Behold the king's spear: let
one of the king's servants come over and fetch it.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord will reward every one according to his
justice, and his faithfulness: for the Lord hath delivered thee
this day into my hand, and I would not put forth my hand against
the Lord's anointed.</span></li>
<li><span>And as thy life hath been much set by this day in my
eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the Lord, and
let him deliver me from all distress.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Saul said to David: Blessed art thou, my son David:
and truly doing thou shalt do, and prevailing thou shalt prevail.
And David went on his way, and Saul returned to his
place.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="27">1 Samuel 27</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And David said in his heart: I shall gone day or other
fall into the hands of Saul: is it not better for me to flee, and
to be saved in the land of the Philistines, that Saul may despair
of me, and cease to seek me in all the coasts of Israel? I will
flee then out of his hands.</span></li>
<li><span>And David arose and went away, both he and the six
hundred men that were with him, to Achis the son of Maoch, king of
Geth.</span></li>
<li><span>And David dwelt with Achis at Geth, he and his men: every
man with his household, and David with his two wives, Achinoam the
Jezrahelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal of Carmel.</span></li>
<li><span>And it was told Saul that David was fled to Geth, and he
sought no more after him.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to Achis: If I have found favour in thy
sight, let a place be given me in one of the cities of this
country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell
in the royal city with thee?</span></li>
<li><span>Then Achis gave him Siceleg that day: for which reason
Siceleg belongeth to the kings of Juda unto this day.</span></li>
<li><span>And the time that David dwelt in the country of the
Philistines, was four months.</span></li>
<li><span>And David and his men went up, and pillaged Gessuri, and
Gerzi, and the Amalecites: for these were of old the inhabitants of
the countries, as men go to Sur, even to the land of
Egypt.</span></li>
<li><span>And David wasted all the land, and left neither man nor
woman alive: and took away the sheep and the oxen, and the asses,
and the camels, and the apparel, and returned and came to
Achis.</span></li>
<li><span>And Achis said to him: Whom hast thou gone against to
day? David answered: Against the south of Juda, and against the
south of Jerameel, and against the south of Ceni.</span></li>
<li><span>And David saved neither man nor woman, neither brought he
any of them to Geth, saying: Lest they should speak against us. So
did David, and such was his proceeding all the days that he dwelt
in the country of the Philistines.</span></li>
<li><span>And Achis believed David, saying: He hath done much harm
to his people Israel: therefore he shall be my servant for
ever.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="28">1 Samuel 28</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines
gathered together their armies to be prepared for war against
Israel: and Achis said to David: Know thou now assuredly, that thou
shalt go out with me to the war, thou, and thy men.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to Achis: Now thou shalt know what thy
servant will do. And Achis said to David: And I will appoint thee
to guard my life for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel mourned for him, and
buried him in Ramatha his city. And Saul had put away all the
magicians and soothsayers out of the land.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Philistines were gathered together, and came and
camped in Sunam: and Saul also gathered together all Israel, and
came to Gelboe.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul saw the army of the Plilistines, and was afraid,
and his heart was very much dismayed.</span></li>
<li><span>And he consulted the Lord, and he answered him not,
neither by dreams, nor by priests, nor by prophets.</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul said to his servants: Seek me a woman that hath
a divining spirit, and I will go to her, and inquire by her. And
his servants said to him: There is a woman that hath a divining
spirit at Endor.</span></li>
<li><span>Then he disguised himself: and put on other clothes, and
he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night,
and he said to her: Divine to me by thy divining spirit, and bring
me up him whom I shall tell thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And the woman said to him: Behold thou knowest all that
Saul hath done, and how he hath rooted out the magicians and
soothsayers from the land: why then dost thou lay a snare for my
life, to cause me to be put to death?</span></li>
<li><span>And Saul swore unto her by the Lord, saying: As the Lord
liveth there shall no evil happen to thee for this
thing.</span></li>
<li><span>And the woman said to him: Whom shall I bring up to thee?
And he said, Bring me up Samuel.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud
voice, and said to Saul: Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art
Saul.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king said to her: Fear not: what hast thou seen?
And the woman said to Saul: I saw gods ascending out of the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to her: What form is he of? And she said: An
old man cometh up, and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul
understood that it was Samuel, and he bowed himself with his face
to the ground, and adored.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel said to Saul: Why hast thou disturbed my rest,
that I should be brought up? And Saul said, I am in great distress:
for the Philistines fight against me, and God is departed from me,
and would not hear me, neither by the hand of prophets, nor by
dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest shew me what
I shall do.</span></li>
<li><span>And Samuel said: Why askest thou me, seeing the Lord has
departed from thee, and is gone over to thy rival:</span></li>
<li><span>For the Lord will do to thee as he spoke by me, and he
will rend thy kingdom out of thy hand, and will give it to thy
neighbour David:</span></li>
<li><span>Because thou didst not obey the voice of the Lord,
neither didst thou execute the wrath of his indignation upon
Amalec. Therefore hath the Lord done to thee what thou sufferest
this day.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord also will deliver Israel with thee into the
hands of the Philistines: and to morrow thou and thy sons shall be
with me: and the Lord will also deliver the army of Israel into the
hands of the Philistines.</span></li>
<li><span>And forthwith Saul fell all along on the ground, for he
was frightened with the words of Samuel, and there was no strength
in him, for he had eaten no bread all that day.</span></li>
<li><span>And the woman came to Saul (for he was very much
troubled) and said to him: Behold thy handmaid hath obeyed thy
voice, and I have put my life in my hand: and I hearkened unto the
words which thou spokest to me.</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore hear thou also the voice of thy handmaid,
and let me set before thee a morsel of bread, that thou mayest eat
and recover strength, and be able to go on thy journey.</span></li>
<li><span>But he refused, and said: I will not eat. But his
servants and the woman forced him, and at length hearkening to
their voice, he arose from the ground and sat upon the
bed.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the woman had a fatted calf in the house, and she
made haste and killed it: and taking meal kneaded it, and baked
some unleavened bread,</span></li>
<li><span>And set it before Saul, and before his servants. And when
they had eaten they rose up, and walked all that night.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="29">1 Samuel 29</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Now all the troops of the Philistines were gathered
together to Aphec: and Israel also camped by the fountain which is
in Jezrahel.</span></li>
<li><span>And the lords of the Philistines marched with their
hundreds and their thousands: but David and his men were in the
rear with Achis.</span></li>
<li><span>And the princes of the Philistines said to Achis: What
mean these Hebrews? And Achis said to the princes of the
Philistines: Do you not know David, who was the servant of Saul the
king of Israel, and hath been with me many days, or years, and I
have found no fault in him, since the day that he fled over to me
until this day?</span></li>
<li><span>But the princes of the Philistines were angry with him,
and they said to him: Let this man return, and abide in his place,
which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to
battle, lest he be an adversary to us, when we shall begin to
fight: for how can he otherwise appease his master, but with our
heads?</span></li>
<li><span>Is not this David, to whom they sung in their dances,
saying: Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten
thousands?</span></li>
<li><span>Then Achis called David, and said to him: As the Lord
liveth, thou art upright and good in my sight: and so is thy going
out, and thy coming in with me in the army: and I have not found my
evil in thee, since the day that thou camest to me unto this day:
but thou pleasest not the lords.</span></li>
<li><span>Return therefore, and go in peace, and offend not the
eyes of the princes of the Philistines.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to Achis: But what have I done, and what
hast thou found in me thy servant, from the day that I have been in
thy sight until this day, that I may not go and fight against the
enemies of my lord the king?</span></li>
<li><span>And Achis answering said to David: I know that thou art
good in my sight, as an angel of God: but the princes of the
Philistines have said: He shall not go up with us to the
battle.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore arise in the morning, thou, and the servants of
thy lord, who came with thee: and when you are up before day, and
it shall begin to be light, go on your way.</span></li>
<li><span>So David and his men arose in the night, that they might
set forward in the morning, and returned to the land of the
Philistines: and the Philistines went up to Jezrahel.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="30">1 Samuel 30</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Now when David and his men were come to Siceleg on the
third day, the Amalecites had made an invasion on the south side
upon Siceleg, and had smitten Siceleg, and burnt it with
fire.</span></li>
<li><span>And had taken the women captives that were in it, both
little and great: and they had not killed any person, but had
carried them with them, and went on their way.</span></li>
<li><span>So when David and his men came to the city, and found it
burnt with fire, and that their wives and their sons, and their
daughters were taken captives,</span></li>
<li><span>David and the people that were with him, lifted up their
voices, and wept till they had no more tears.</span></li>
<li><span>For the two wives also of David were taken captives,
Achinoam the Jezrahelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal of
Carmel.</span></li>
<li><span>And David was greatly afflicted: for the people had a
mind to stone him, for the soul of every man was bitterly grieved
for his sons, and daughters: but David took courage in the Lord his
God.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to Abiathar the priest the son of Achimelech:
Bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought the ephod to
David.</span></li>
<li><span>And David consulted the Lord, saying: Shall I pursue
after these robbers, and shall I overtake them, or not? And the
Lord said to him: Pursue after them: for thou shalt surely overtake
them and recover the prey.</span></li>
<li><span>So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with
him, and they came to the torrent Besor: and some being weary
stayed there.</span></li>
<li><span>But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two
hundred stayed, who being weary could not go over the torrent
Besor.</span></li>
<li><span>And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him
to David: and they gave him bread to eat, and water to
drink,</span></li>
<li><span>As also a piece of a cake of figs, and two bunches of
raisins. And when he had eaten them his spirit returned, and he was
refreshed: for he had not eaten bread, nor drunk water three days,
and three nights.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to him: To whom dost thou belong? or
whence dost thou come? and whither art thou going? He said: I am a
young man of Egypt, the servant of an Amalecite, and my master left
me, because I began to be sick three days ago.</span></li>
<li><span>For we made an invasion on the south side of Cerethi, and
upon Juda, and upon the south of Caleb, and we burnt Siceleg with
fire.</span></li>
<li><span>And David said to him: Canst thou bring me to this
company? And he said: Swear to me by God, that thou wilt not kill
me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring
thee to this company. And David swore to him.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he had brought him, behold they were lying
spread upon all the ground, eating and drinking, and as it were
keeping a festival day, for all the prey, and the spoils which they
had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land
of Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>And David slew them from the evening unto the evening of
the next day, and there escaped not a man of them, but four hundred
young men, who had gotten upon camels, and fled.</span></li>
<li><span>So David recovered all that the Amalecites had taken, and
he rescued his two wives.</span></li>
<li><span>And there was nothing missing small or great, neither of
their sons or their daughters, nor of the spoils, and whatsoever
they had taken: David recovered all.</span></li>
<li><span>And he took all the flocks and the herds, and made them
go before him: and they said: This is the prey of
David.</span></li>
<li><span>And David came to the two hundred men, who being weary
had stayed, and were not able to follow David, and he had ordered
them to abide at the torrent Besor: and they came out to meet
David, and the people that were with him. And David coming to the
people saluted them peaceably.</span></li>
<li><span>Then all the wicked and unjust men that had gone with
David answering, said: Because they came not with us, we will not
give them any thing of the prey which we have recovered: but let
every man take his wife and his children, and be contented with
them, and go his way.</span></li>
<li><span>But David said: You shall not do so, my brethren, with
these things, which the Lord hath given us, who hath kept us, and
hath delivered the robbers that invaded us into our
hands.</span></li>
<li><span>And no man shall hearken to you in this matter. But equal
shall be the portion of him that went down to battle and of him
that abode at the baggage, and they shall divide alike.</span></li>
<li><span>And this hath been done from that day forward, and since
was made a statute, and an ordinance, and as a law in
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Then David came to Siceleg, and sent presents of the prey
to the ancients of Juda his neighbours, saying: Receive a blessing
of the prey of the enemies of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>To them that were in Bethel, and that were in Ramoth to
the south, and to them that were in Jether,</span></li>
<li><span>And to them that were in Aroer and that were in
Sephamoth, and that were in Esthamo,</span></li>
<li><span>And that were in Rachal, and that were in the cities of
Jerameel, and that were in the cities of Ceni,</span></li>
<li><span>And that were in Arama, and that were in the lake Asan,
and that were in Athach,</span></li>
<li><span>And that were in Hebron, and to the rest that were in
those places, in which David had abode with his men.</span></li>

</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="31">1 Samuel 31</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of
Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in
mount Gelboe.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Philistines fell upon Saul, and upon his sons,
and they slew Jonathan, and Abinadab and Melchisua the sons of
Saul.</span></li>
<li><span>And the whole weight of the battle was turned upon Saul:
and the archers overtook him, and he was grievously wounded by the
archers.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Saul said to his armourbearer: Draw thy sword, and
kill me: lest these uncircumcised come, and slay me, and mock at
me. And his armourbearer would not: for he was struck with
exceeding great fear. Then Saul took his sword, and fell upon
it.</span></li>
<li><span>And when his armourbearer saw this, to wit, that Saul was
dead, he also fell upon his sword and died with him.</span></li>
<li><span>So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer,
and all his men that same day together.</span></li>
<li><span>And the men of Israel, that were beyond the valley, and
beyond the Jordan, seeing that the Israelites were fled, and that
Saul was dead, and his sons, forsook their cities, and fled: and
the Philistines came, and dwelt there.</span></li>
<li><span>And on the morrow the Philistines came to strip the
slain, and they found Saul and his three sons lying in mount
Gelboe.</span></li>
<li><span>And they cut off Saul's head, and stripped him of his
armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to
publish it in the temples of their idols, and among their
people.</span></li>
<li><span>And they put his armour in the temple of Astaroth, but
his body they hung on the wall of Bethsan.</span></li>
<li><span>Now when the inhabitants of Jabes Galaad had heard all
that the Philistines had done to Saul,</span></li>
<li><span>All the most valiant men arose, and walked all the night,
and took the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, from the
wall of Bethsan: and they came to Jabes Galaad, and burnt them
there:</span></li>
<li><span>And they took their bones and buried them in the wood of
Jabes: and fasted seven days.</span></li>
