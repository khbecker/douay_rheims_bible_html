For I know whom I have believed, and I am certain that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him, against that day.<li>Hold the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me in faith, and in the love which is in Christ Jesus.<li>Keep the good thing committed to thy trust by the Holy Ghost, who dwelleth in us.<li>Thou knowest this, that all they who are in Asia, are turned away from me: of whom are Phigellus and Hermogenes.<li>The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus: because he hath often refreshed me, and hath not been ashamed of my chain:<li>But when he was come to Rome, he carefully sought me, and found me.<li>The Lord grant unto him to find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou very well knowest.</ol><h2><a name=2>2 Timothy 2</a></h2><ol><li>Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus:<li>And the things which thou hast heard of me by many witnesses, the same commend to faithful men, who shall be fit to teach others also.<li>Labour as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.<li>No man, being a soldier to God, entangleth himself with secular businesses; that he may please him to whom he hath engaged himself.<li>For he also that striveth for the mastery, is not crowned, except he strive lawfully.<li>The husbandman, that laboureth, must first partake of the fruits.<li>Understand what I say: for the Lord will give thee in all things understanding.<li>Be mindful that the Lord Jesus Christ is risen again from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel.<li>Wherein I labour even unto bands, as an evildoer; but the word of God is not bound.<li>Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation, which is in Christ Jesus, with heavenly glory.<li>A faithful saying: for if we be dead with him, we shall live also with him.<li>If we suffer, we shall also reign with him. If we deny him, he will also deny us.<li>If we believe not, he continueth faithful, he can not deny himself.<li>Of these things put them in mind, charging them before the Lord. Contend not in words, for it is to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.<li>Carefully study to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.<li>But shun profane and vain babblings: for they grow much towards ungodliness.<li>And their speech spreadeth like a canker: of whom are Hymeneus and Philetus:<li>Who have erred from the truth, saying, that the resurrection is past already, and have subverted the faith of some.<li>But the sure foundation of God standeth firm, having this seal: the Lord knoweth who are his; and let every one depart from iniquity who nameth the name of the Lord.<li>But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and earth: and some indeed unto honour, but some unto dishonour.<li>If any man therefore shall cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified and profitable to the Lord, prepared unto every good work.<li>But flee thou youthful desires, and pursue justice, faith, charity, and peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.<li>And avoid foolish and unlearned questions, knowing that they beget strifes.<li>But the servant of the Lord must not wrangle: but be mild towards all men, apt to teach, patient,<li>With modesty admonishing them that resist the truth: if peradventure God may give them repentance to know the truth,<li>And they may recover themselves from the snares of the devil, by whom they are held captive at his will.</ol><h2><a name=3>2 Timothy 3</a></h2><ol><li>Know also this, that, in the last days, shall come dangerous times.<li>Men shall be lovers of themselves, covetous, haughty, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, wicked,<li>Without affection, without peace, slanderers, incontinent, unmerciful, without kindness,<li>Traitors, stubborn, puffed up, and lovers of pleasures more than of God:<li>Having an appearance indeed of godliness, but denying the power thereof. Now these avoid.<li>For of these sort are they who creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, who are led away with divers desires:<li>Ever learning, and never attaining to the knowledge of the truth.<li>Now as Jannes and Mambres resisted Moses, so these also resist the truth, men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.<li>But they shall proceed no farther; for their folly shall be manifest to all men, as theirs also was.<li>But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,<li>Persecutions, afflictions: such as came upon me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra: what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord delivered me.<li>And all that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution.<li>But evil men and seducers shall grow worse and worse: erring, and driving into error.<li>But continue thou in those things which thou hast learned, and which have been committed to thee: knowing of whom thou hast learned them;<li>And because from thy infancy thou hast known the holy scriptures, which can instruct thee to salvation, by the faith which is in Christ Jesus.<li>All scripture, inspired of God, is profitable to teach, to reprove, to correct, to instruct in justice,<li>That the man of God may be perfect, furnished to every good work.</ol><h2><a name=4>2 Timothy 4</a></h2><ol><li>I charge thee, before God and Jesus Christ, who shall judge the living and the dead, by his coming, and his kingdom:<li>Preach the word: be instant in season, out of season: reprove, entreat, rebuke in all patience and doctrine.<li>For there shall be a time, when they will not endure sound doctrine; but, according to their own desires, they will heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears:<li>And will indeed turn away their hearing from the truth, but will be turned unto fables.<li>But be thou vigilant, labour in all things, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry. Be sober.<li>For I am even now ready to be sacrificed: and the time of my dissolution is at hand.<li>I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.<li>As to the rest, there is laid up for me a crown of justice, which the Lord the just judge will render to me in that day: and not only to me, but to them also that love his coming. Make haste to come to me quickly.<li>For Demas hath left me, loving this world, and is gone to Thessalonica:<li>Crescens into Galatia, Titus into Dalmatia.<li>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.<li>But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.<li>The cloak that I left at Troas, with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, especially the parchments.<li>Alexander the coppersmith hath done me much evil: the Lord will reward him according to his works:<li>Whom do thou also avoid, for he hath greatly withstood our words.<li>At my first answer no man stood with me, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their charge.<li>But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that by me the preaching may be accomplished, and that all the Gentiles may hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.<li>The Lord hath delivered me from every evil work: and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.<li>Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.<li>Erastus remained at Corinth. And Trophimus I left sick at Miletus.<li>Make haste to come before winter Eubulus and Pudens, and Linus and Claudia, and all the brethren, salute thee.<li>The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.</ol></body></html>
