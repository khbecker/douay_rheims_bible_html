<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="1">Isaiah 1</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>The vision of Isaiah the son of Amos I which he saw
concerning Juda and Jerusalem in the days of Ozias, Joathan, Achaz,
and Ezechias, kings of Juda</span></li>
<li><span>Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the Lord
hath spoken. I have brought up children, and exalted them: but they
have despised me.</span></li>
<li><span>The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib:
but Israel hath not known me, and my people hath not
understood.</span></li>
<li><span>Woe to the sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a
wicked seed, ungracious children: they have forsaken the Lord, they
have blasphemed the Holy One of Israel, they are gone away
backwards.</span></li>
<li><span>For what shall I strike you any more, you that increase
transgression? the whole head is sick, and the whole heart is
sad.</span></li>
<li><span>From the sole of the foot unto the top of the head, there
is no soundness therein: wounds and bruises and swelling sores:
they are not bound up, nor dressed, nor fomented with
oil.</span></li>
<li><span>Your land is desolate, your cities are burnt with fire:
your country strangers devour before your face, and it shall be
desolate as when wasted by enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>And the daughter of Sion shall be left as a covert in a
vineyard, and as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, and as a city
that is laid waste.</span></li>
<li><span>Except the Lord of hosts had left us seed, we had been as
Sodom, and we should have been like to Gomorrha.</span></li>
<li><span>Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom, give ear
to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrha.</span></li>
<li><span>To what purpose do you offer me the multitude of your
victims, saith the Lord? I am full, I desire not holocausts of
rams, and fat of fatlings, and blood of calves, and lambs, and buck
goats.</span></li>
<li><span>When you came to appear before me, who required these
things at your hands, that you should walk in my
courts?</span></li>
<li><span>Offer sacrifice no more in vain: incense is an
abomination tome. The new moons, and the sabbaths, and other
festivals I will not abide, your assemblies are wicked.</span></li>
<li><span>My soul hateth your new moons, and your solemnities: they
are become troublesome to me, I am weary of bearing
them.</span></li>
<li><span>And when you stretch forth your hands, I will turn away
my eyes from you: and when you multiply prayer, I will not hear:
for your hands are full of blood.</span></li>
<li><span>Wash yourselves, be clean, take away the evil of your
devices from my eyes: cease to do perversely,</span></li>
<li><span>Learn to do well: seek judgment, relieve the oppressed,
judge for the fatherless, defend the widow.</span></li>
<li><span>And then come, and accuse me, saith the Lord: if your
sins be as scarlet, they shall be made as white as snow: and if
they be red as crimson, they shall be white as wool.</span></li>
<li><span>if you be willing, and will hearken to me, you shall eat
the good things of the land.</span></li>
<li><span>But if you will not, and will provoke me to wrath: the
sword shall devour you because the mouth of the Lord hath spoken
it.</span></li>
<li><span>How is the faithful city, that was full of judgment,
become a harlot? justice dwelt in it, but now
murderers.</span></li>
<li><span>Thy silver is turned into dress: thy wine is mingled with
water.</span></li>
<li><span>Thy princes are faithless, companions of thieves: they
all love bribes, the run after rewards. They judge not for the
fatherless: and the widow's cometh not in to them.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore saith the Lord the God of hosts, the mighty one
of Israel: Ah! I will comfort myself over my adversaries: and I
will be revenged of my enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will turn my hand to thee, and I will clean purge
away thy dress, and I will take away all thy tin.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will restore thy judges se they were before, and
thy counsellors as of old. After this thou shalt be called the city
of the just, a faithful city.</span></li>
<li><span>Sion shall be redeemed in judgment, and they shall bring
her back in justice.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall destroy the wicked, and the sinners
together: and they that have forsaken the Lord, shall be
consumed.</span></li>
<li><span>For they shall be confounded for the idols, to which they
have sacrificed: and you shall be ashamed of the gardens which you
have chosen.</span></li>
<li><span>When you shall be as an oak with the leaves falling off,
and as a garden without water.</span></li>
<li><span>And your strength shall be as the ashes of tow, and your
work as a spark: and both shall burn together, and there shall be
none to quench it.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="2">Isaiah 2</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>The word that Isaiah the son of Amos saw, concerning Juda
and Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And in the last days the mountain of the house of the
Lord shall be prepared on the top of mountains, and it shall be
exalted above the hills, and all nations shall flow unto
it.</span></li>
<li><span>And many people shall go, and say: Come and let us go up
to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob,
and he will teach us his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for
the law shall come forth from Sion, and the word of the Lord from
Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall judge the Gentiles, and rebuke many people:
and they shall turn their swords into ploughshares, and their
spears into sickles: nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
neither shall they be exercised any more to war.</span></li>
<li><span>O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light
of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>For thou hast cast off thy people, the house of Jacob:
because they are filled as in times past, and have had soothsayers
as the Philistines, and have adhered to strange
children.</span></li>
<li><span>Their land is filled with silver and gold: and there is
no end of their treasures.</span></li>
<li><span>And their land is filled with horses: and their chariots
are innumerable. Their land also is full of idols: they have adored
the work of their own hands, which their own fingers have
made.</span></li>
<li><span>And man hath bowed himself down, and man hath been
debased: therefore forgive them not.</span></li>
<li><span>Enter thou into the rock, and hide thee in the pit from
the face of the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of his
majesty.</span></li>
<li><span>The lofty eyes of man are humbled, and the haughtiness of
men shall be made to stoop: and the Lord alone shall be exalted in
that day.</span></li>
<li><span>Because the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every
one that is proud and highminded, and upon every one that is
arrogant, and he shall be humbled.</span></li>
<li><span>And upon all the tall and lofty cedars of Libanus, and
upon all the oaks of Basan.</span></li>
<li><span>And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the
elevated hills.</span></li>
<li><span>And upon every high tower, and every fenced
wall.</span></li>
<li><span>And upon all the ships of Tharsis, and upon all that is
fair to behold.</span></li>
<li><span>And the loftiness of men shall be bowed down, and the
haughtiness of men shall be humbled, and the Lord alone shall be
exalted in that day.</span></li>
<li><span>And idols shall be utterly destroyed.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall go into the holes of rocks, and into the
caves of the earth from the face of the fear of the Lord, and from
the glory of his majesty, when he shall rise up to strike the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>In that day a man shall cast away his idols of silver,
and his idols of gold, which he had made for himself to adore,
moles and bats.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall go into the clefts of rocks, and into the
holes of stones from the face of the fear of the Lord, and from the
glory of his majesty, when he shall rise up to strike the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>Cease ye therefore from the man, whose breath is in his
nostrils, for he is reputed high.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="3">Isaiah 3</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>For behold the sovereign the Lord of hosts shall take
away from Jerusalem, and from Juda the valiant and the strong, the
whole strength of bread, and the whole strength of
water.</span></li>
<li><span>The strong man, and the man of war, the judge, and the
prophet, and the cunning man, and the ancient.</span></li>
<li><span>The captain over fifty, and the honourable in
countenance, and the counsellor, and the architect, and the skilful
in eloquent speech.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will give children to be their princes, and the
effeminate shall rule over them.</span></li>
<li><span>And the people shall rush one upon another, and every man
against his neighbour: the child shall make it tumult against the
ancient, and the base against the honourable.</span></li>
<li><span>For a man shall take hold or his brother, one of the
house of his father, saying: Thou hast a garment, be thou our
ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand.</span></li>
<li><span>In that day he shall answer, saying: I am no healer, and
in my house there is no bread, nor clothing: make me not ruler of
the people.</span></li>
<li><span>For Jerusalem is ruined, and Juda is fallen: because
their tongue, and their devices are against the Lord, to provoke
the eyes of his majesty.</span></li>
<li><span>The shew of their countenance hath answered them: and
they have proclaimed abroad their sin as Sodom, and they have not
hid it: woe to their souls, for evils are rendered to
them.</span></li>
<li><span>Say to the just man that it is well, for he shall eat the
fruit of his doings.</span></li>
<li><span>Woe to the wicked unto evil: for the reward of his hands
shall be given him.</span></li>
<li><span>As for my people, their oppressors have stripped them,
and women have ruled over them. O my people, they that call thee
blessed, the same deceive thee, and destroy the way of thy
steps.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord standeth up to judge, and he standeth to judge
the people.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of
his people, and its princes: for you have devoured the vineyard,
and the spoil of the poor is in your house.</span></li>
<li><span>Why do you consume my people, and grind the faces of the
poor? saith the Lord the God of hosts.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said: Because the daughters of Sion are
haughty, and have walked with stretched out necks, and wanton
glances of their eyes, and made a noise as they walked with their
feet and moved in a set pace:</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord will make bald the crown of the head of the
daughters of Sion, and the Lord will discover their
hair.</span></li>
<li><span>In that day the Lord will take away the ornaments of
shoes, end little moons,</span></li>
<li><span>And chains and necklaces, and bracelets, and
bonnets,</span></li>
<li><span>And bodkins, and ornaments of the legs, and tablets, and
sweet balls, and earrings,</span></li>
<li><span>And rings, and jewels hanging on the
forehead,</span></li>
<li><span>And changes of apparel, and short cloaks, and fine linen,
and crisping pins,</span></li>
<li><span>And looking-glasses, and lawns, and headbands, and fine
veils.</span></li>
<li><span>And instead of a sweet smell there shall be stench, and
instead of a girdle, a cord, and instead of curled hair, baldness,
and instead of a stomacher, haircloth.</span></li>
<li><span>Thy fairest men also shall fall by the sword, and thy
valiant ones in battle.</span></li>
<li><span>And her gates shall lament and mourn, and she shall sit
desolate on the ground.</span></li>

let us be called by thy name, take away our reproach.</span></li>
<li><span>In that day the bud of the Lord shall be in magnificence
and glory, and the fruit of the earth shall be high, and a great
joy to them that shall have escaped of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall come to pass, that every one that shall be
left in Sion, and that shall remain in Jerusalem, shall be called
holy, every one that is written in life in Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>If the Lord shall wash away the filth of the daughters of
Sion, and shall wash away the blood of Jerusalem out of the midst
thereof, by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of
burning.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord will create upon every place of mount Sion,

brightness of a flaming fire in the night: for over all the glory

<ol>
<li><span>For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one little measure,
and thirty bushels of seed shall yield three bushels.</span></li>
<li><span>Woe to you that rise up early in the morning to follow
drunkenness, and to drink till the evening, to be inflamed with
wine.</span></li>
<li><span>The harp, and the lyre, and the timbrel, and the pipe,
and wine are in your feasts: and the work of the Lord you regard
not, nor do you consider the works of his hands.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore is my people led away captive, because they had
not knowledge, and their nobles have perished with famine, and
their multitude were dried up with thirst.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore hath hell enlarged her soul, and opened her
mouth without any bounds, and their strong ones, and their people,
and their high and glorious ones shall go down into it.</span></li>
<li><span>And man shall be brought down, and man shall be humbled,
and the eyes of the lofty shall be brought low.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and
the holy God shall be sanctified in justice.</span></li>
<li><span>And the lambs shall feed according to their order, and
strangers shall eat the deserts turned into
fruitfulness.</span></li>
<li><span>Woe to you that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and
sin as the rope of a cart.</span></li>
<li><span>That say: Let him make haste, and let his work come
quickly, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of
Israel come, that we may know it.</span></li>
<li><span>Woe to you that call evil good, and good evil: that put
darkness for light, and light for darkness: that put bitter for
sweet, and sweet for bitter.</span></li>
<li><span>Woe to you that rue wise in your own eyes, and prudent in
your own conceits.</span></li>
<li><span>Woe to you that are mighty to drink wine, and stout men
at drunkenness.</span></li>
<li><span>That justify the wicked for gifts, and take away the
justice of the just from him.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore as the tongue of the fire devoureth the
stubble, and the heat of the dame consumeth it: so shall their root
be as ashes, and their bud shall go up se dust: for they have cast
away the law of the Lord of hosts, and have blasphemed the word of
the Holy One of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore is the wrath of the Lord kindled against his
people, and he hath stretched out his hand upon them, and struck
them: and the mountains were troubled, and their carcasses became
as dung in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not
turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</span></li>
<li><span>And he will lift up a sign to the nations afar off, and
will whistle to them from the ends of the earth: and behold they
shall come with speed swiftly.</span></li>
<li><span>There is none that shall faint, nor labour among them:
they shall not slumber nor sleep, neither shall the girdle of their
loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be
broken.</span></li>
<li><span>Their arrows are sharp, and all their bows are bent. The
hoofs of their horses shall be like the hint, and their wheels like
the violence of a tempest.</span></li>
<li><span>Their roaring like that of a lion, they shall roar like
young lions: yea they shall roar, and take hold of the prey, and
they shall keep fast hold of it, and there shall be none to deliver
it.</span></li>

the roaring of the sea; we shall look towards the land, and behold
darkness of tribulation, and the light is darkened with the mist

<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="6">Isaiah 6</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>In the year that king Ozias died, I saw the Lord sitting
upon a throne high and elevated: and his train filled the
temple.</span></li>
<li><span>Upon it stood the seraphims: the one had six wings, and
the other had six wings: with two they covered his face, and with
two they covered his feet, and with two they hew.</span></li>
<li><span>And they cried one to another, and said: Holy, holy,
holy, the Lord God of hosts, all the earth is full of his
glory.</span></li>
<li><span>And the lintels of the doors were moved at the voice of
him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.</span></li>
<li><span>And I said: Woe is me, because I have held my peace;
because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a
people that hath unclean lips, and I have seen with my eyes the
King the Lord of hosts.</span></li>
<li><span>And one of the seraphims flew to me, and in his hand was
a live coal, which he had taken with the tongs off the
altar.</span></li>
<li><span>And he touched my mouth, and said: Behold this hath
touched thy lips, and thy iniquities shall be taken away, and thy
sin shall be cleansed.</span></li>
<li><span>And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: Whom shall I
send? and who shall go for us? And I said: Lo, here am I, send
me.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said: Go, and thou shalt say to this people:
Hearing, hear, and understand not: and see the vision, and know it
not.</span></li>
<li><span>Blind the heart of this people, and make their ears
heavy, and shut their eyes: lest they see with their eyes, and hear
with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted
and I heal them.</span></li>
<li><span>And I said: How long, O Lord? And he said: Until the
cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man,
and the land shall be left desolate.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord shall remove men far away, and she shall be
multiplied that was left in the midst of the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And there shall be still a tithing therein, and she shall
turn, and shall be made a show as a turpentine tree, and as an oak
that spreadeth its branches: that which shall stand therein, shall
be a holy seed.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="7">Isaiah 7</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And it came to pass in the days of Achaz the son of
Joathan, the son of Ozias, king of Juda, that Basin king of Syria,
and Phacee the son of Romelia king of Israel, came up to Jerusalem,
to fight against it: but they could not prevail over
it.</span></li>
<li><span>And they told the house of David, saying: Syria hath
rested upon Ephraim, and his heart was moved, and the heart of his
people, as the trees of the woods are moved with the
wind.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Isaiah: Go forth to meet Achaz, thou
and Jasub thy son that is left, to the conduit of the upper pool, a
in the way of the fuller's held.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt say to him: See thou be quiet: fear not,
and let not thy heart be afraid of the two tails of these fire
brands, smoking with the wrath of the fury of Rasin king of Syria,
end of the son of Romelia.</span></li>
<li><span>Because Syria hath taken counsel against thee, unto the
evil of Ephraim and the son of Romelia, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Let us go up to Juda, and rouse it up, and draw it away
to us, and make the son of Tabeel king in the midst
thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord God: It shall not stand, and this
shall not be.</span></li>
<li><span>But the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of
Damascus is Basin: and within threescore and five years, Ephraim
shall cease to be a people:</span></li>
<li><span>And the head of Ephraim is Samaria and the head of
Samaria the son of Romelia. If you will not believe, you shall not
continue.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke again to Achaz, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God either unto the depth
of hell, or unto the height above.</span></li>
<li><span>And Achaz said: I will not ask, and I will not tempt the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said: Hear ye therefore, O house of David: Is it a
small thing for you to be grievous to men, that you are grievous to
my God also?</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign. Behold
a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and his name shall be
called Emmanuel.</span></li>
<li><span>He shall eat butter and honey, that he may know to refuse
the evil, and to choose the good.</span></li>
<li><span>For before the child know to refuse the evil, and to
choose the good, the land which thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of
the face of her two kings.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and
upon the house of thy father, days that have not come since the
time of the separation of Ephraim from Juda with the king of the
Assyrians.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord
shall hiss for the fly, that is in the uttermost parts of the
rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of
Assyria.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall come, and shall all of them rest in the
torrents of the valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon
all places set with shrubs, and in all hollow places.</span></li>
<li><span>In that day the Lord shall shave with a razor that is
hired by them that are beyond the river, by the king of the
Assyrians, the head and the hairs of the feet, and the whole
beard.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall
nourish a young cow, and two sheep.</span></li>
<li><span>And for the abundance of milk he shall eat butter: for
butter and honey shall every one eat that shall be left in the
midst of the land.</span></li>

briars and thorns shall be in all the land.</span></li>

shall be for the ox to feed on, and the lesser cattle to tread
upon.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>And the Lord said to me: Take thee a great book, and
write in it with a man's pen. Take sway the spoils with speed,
quickly take the prey.</span></li>
<li><span>And I took unto me faithful witnesses, Urias the priest,
and Zacharias the son of Barachias.</span></li>
<li><span>And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived, and bore
a son. And the Lord said to me: Call his name, Hasten to take away
the spoils: Make haste to take away the prey.</span></li>
<li><span>For before the child know to call his father and his
mother, the strength of Damascus, and the spoils of Samaria shall
be taken away before the king of the Assyrians.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord spoke to me again, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Forasmuch as this people hath cast away the waters of
Siloe, that go with silence, and hath rather taken Basin, and the
son of Romelia:</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore behold the Lord will bring upon them the waters
of the river strong and many, the king of the Assyrians, and all
his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and shall
overflow all his banks,</span></li>
<li><span>And shall pass through Juda, overflowing, and going over
shall reach even to the neck. And the stretching out of his wings
shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Emmanuel.</span></li>
<li><span>Gather yourselves together, O ye people, and be overcome,
and give ear, all ye lands afar off: strengthen yourselves, end be
overcome, gird yourselves, and be overcome.</span></li>
<li><span>Take counsel together, and it shall be defeated: speak a
word, and it shall not be done: because God is with us.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord to me: As he hath taught me, with
a strong arm, that I should not walk in the way of this people,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Say ye not: A conspiracy: for all that this people
speaketh, is a conspiracy: neither fear ye their fear, nor be
afraid.</span></li>
<li><span>Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself: and let him be your
fear, and let him be your dread.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall be a sanctification to you. But for a stone
or stumbling, and for a rock of offence to the two houses of
Israel, for a snare and a ruin to the inhabitants of
Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And very many of them shall stumble and fall, and shall
be broken in pieces, and shall be snared, and taken.</span></li>
<li><span>Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my
disciples.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will wait for the Lord, who hath hid his face from
the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I and my children, whom the Lord hath given me for
a sign, and for a wonder in Israel from the Lord of hosts, who
dwelleth in mount Sion.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they shall say to you: Seek of pythons, and of
diviners, who mutter in their enchantments: should not the people
seek of their God, for the living of the dead?</span></li>
<li><span>To the law rather, and to the testimony. And if they
speak not according to this word, they shall not have the morning
light.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall pass by it, they shall fall, and be
hungry: and when they shall be hungry, they will be angry, and
curse their king, and their God, and look upwards.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall look to the earth, and behold trouble and
darkness, weakness and distress, and a mist following them, and
they cannot fly away from their distress.</span></li>

<li><span>At the first time the land of Zabulon, and the land of
Nephtali was lightly touched: and at the last the way of the sea
beyond the Jordan of the Galilee of the Gentiles was heavily
loaded.</span></li>
<li><span>The people that walked in darkness, have seen a great
light: to them that dwelt in the region of the shadow of death,
light is risen.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast multiplied the nation, and hast not increased
the joy. They shall rejoice before thee, as they that rejoice in
the harvest, as conquerors rejoice after taking a prey, when they
divide the spoils.</span></li>
<li><span>For the yoke of their burden, and the rod of their
shoulder, and the sceptre of their oppressor thou best overcome, as
in the day of Median.</span></li>
<li><span>For every violent taking of spoils, with tumult, and
garment mingled with blood, shall be burnt, and be fuel for the
fire.</span></li>
<li><span>For a CHILD IS BORN to us, and a son is given to us, and
the government is upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called,
Wonderful, Counsellor, God the Mighty, the Father of the world to
come, the Prince of Peace.</span></li>
<li><span>His empire shall be multiplied, and there shall be no end
of peace: he shall sit upon the throne of David, and upon his
kingdom; to establish it and strengthen it with judgment and with
justice, from henceforth and for ever: the zeal of the Lord of
hosts will perform this.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the people of Ephraim shall know, and the
inhabitants of Samaria that say in the pride and haughtiness of
their heart:</span></li>
<li><span>The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with square
stones: they have cut down the sycamores, but we will change them
for cedars.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord shall set up the enemies of Rasin over him,
and shall bring on his enemies in a crowd:</span></li>
<li><span>The Syrians from the east, and the Philistines from the
west: and they shall devour Israel with open mouth, For all this
his indignation is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out
still.</span></li>
<li><span>And the people are not returned to him who hath struck
them, and have not sought after the Lord of hosts.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord shall destroy out of Israel the head and the
tail, him that bendeth down, and him that holdeth back, in one
day.</span></li>
<li><span>The aged and honourable, he is the head: and the prophet
that teacheth lies, he is the tail.</span></li>
<li><span>And they that call this people blessed, shall cause them
to err: and they that are called blessed, shall be thrown down
headlong.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore the Lord shell have no joy in their young men:
neither shall he have mercy on their fatherless, and widows: for
every one is a hypocrite and wicked, and every mouth hath spoken
folly. For all this his indignation is not turned away, but his
bend is stretched out still.</span></li>
<li><span>For wickedness is kindled as a fire, it shall devour the
brier and the thorn: and shall kindle in the thicket of the forest,
and it shall be wrapped up in smoke ascending on high.</span></li>
<li><span>By the wrath of the Lord of hosts the land is troubled,
and the people shall be as fuel for the fire: no man shall spare
his brother.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall turn to the right hand, and shall be hungry:
and shall eat on the left hand, and shall not be filled: every one
shell eat the flesh of his own arm: Manasses Ephraim, and Ephraim
Manasses, and they together shall be against Juda.</span></li>

write injustice:</span></li>
<li><span>To oppress the poor in judgment, and do violence to the
cause of the humble of my people: that widows might be their prey,
and that they might rob the fatherless.</span></li>
<li><span>What will you do in the day of visitation, and of the
calamity which cometh from afar? to whom will ye flee for help? and
where will ye leave your glory?</span></li>
<li><span>That you be not bowed down under the bond, and fall with
the slain? In all these things his anger is not turned away, but
his hand is stretched out still.</span></li>
<li><span>Woe to the Assyrian, he is the rod and the staff of my
anger, and my indignation is in their hands.</span></li>
<li><span>I will send him to a deceitful nation, and I will give
him a charge against the people of my wrath, to take away the
spoils, and to lay hold on the prey, and to tread them down like
the mire of the streets.</span></li>
<li><span>But he shall not take it so, and his heart shall not
think so: but his heart shall be set to destroy, and to cut off
nations not a few.</span></li>
<li><span>For he shall say:</span></li>
<li><span>Are not my princes as so many kings ? is not Calano as
Charcamis: and Emath as Arphad? is not Samaria as
Damascus?</span></li>
<li><span>As my hand hath found the king- dome of the idol, so also
their idols of Jerusalem, and of Samaria.</span></li>
<li><span>Shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols, so
do to Jerusalem and her idols?</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall come to pass, that when the Lord shall have
performed all his works in mount Sion, and in Jerusalem, I will
visit the fruit of the proud heart of the king of Assyria, and the
glory of the haughtiness of his eyes.</span></li>
<li><span>For he hath said: By the strength of my own hand I have
done it, and by my own wisdom I have understood: and I have removed
the bounds of the people, and have taken the spoils of the princes,
and as a mighty man hath pulled down them that sat on
high.</span></li>
<li><span>And my hand hath found the strength of the people as a
nest; and as eggs are gathered, that are left, so have I gathered
all the earth: and there was none that moved the wing, or opened
the mouth, or made the least noise.</span></li>
<li><span>Shall the axe boast itself against him that cutteth with
it? or shall the saw exalt itself against him by whom it is drawn?
as if a rod should lift itself up against him that lifteth it up,
and a staff exalt itself, which is but wood.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore the sovereign Lord, the Lord of hosts, shall
send leanness among his fat ones: and under his glory shall be
kindled a burning, as it were the burning of a fire.</span></li>
<li><span>And the light of Israel shall be as a fire, and the Holy
One thereof as a flame: and his thorns and his briers shall be set
on fire, and shall be devoured in one day.</span></li>
<li><span>And the glory of his forest, and of his beautiful hill,
shall be consumed from the soul even to the flesh, and he shall run
away through fear.</span></li>
<li><span>And they that remain of the trees of his forest shall be
so few, that they shall easily be numbered, and a child shall write
them down.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant
of Israel, and they that shall escape of the house of Jacob, shall
lean no more upon him that striketh them: but they shall lean upon
the Lord the Holy One of Israel, in truth.</span></li>
<li><span>The remnant shall be converted, the remnant, I say, of
Jacob, to the mighty God.</span></li>
<li><span>For if thy people, O Israel, shall be as the sand of the
sea, a remnant of them shall be converted, the consumption abridged
shall overflow with justice.</span></li>
<li><span>For the Lord God of hosts shall make a consumption, and
an abridgment in the midst of all the land.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore, thus saith the Lord the God of hosts: O my
people that dwellest in Sion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he
shall strike thee with his rod, and he shall lift up his staff over
thee in the way of Egypt.</span></li>
<li><span>For yet a little and a very little while, and my
indignation shall cease, and my wrath shall be upon their
wickedness.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord of hosts shall raise up a scourge against
him, according to the slaughter of Madian in the rock of Oreb, and
his rod over the sea, and he shall lift it up in the way of
Egypt.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden
shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off
thy neck, and the yoke shall putrify at the presence of the
oil.</span></li>

<li><span>Medemena is removed: ye inhabitants of Gabim, take
courage.</span></li>
<li><span>It is yet day enough, to remain in Nobe: he shall shake
his hand against the mountain of the daughter of Sion, the hill of
Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold the sovereign Lord of hosts shall break the
earthen vessel with terror, and the tall of stature shall be cut
down, and the lofty shall be humbled.</span></li>

Sion.</span></li>

and as young ones flying out of the nest, so shall the daughters of
Moab be in the passage of Arnon.</span></li>
<li><span>Take counsel, gather a council: make thy shadow as the
night in the midday: hide them that flee, and betray not them that
wander about.</span></li>
<li><span>My fugitives shall dwell with thee: O Moab, be thou a
covert to them from the face of the destroyer: for the dust is at
an end, the wretch is consumed: he hath failed, that trod the earth
under foot.</span></li>
<li><span>And a throne shall be prepared in mercy, and one shall
sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging and
seeking judgment and quickly rendering that which is
just.</span></li>
<li><span>We have heard of the pride of Moab, he is exceeding
proud: his pride and his arrogancy, and his indignation is more
than his strength.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore shall Moab howl to Moab, every one shall howl:
to them that rejoice upon the brick walls, tell ye their
stripes.</span></li>
<li><span>For the suburbs of Hesebon are desolate, and the lords of
the nations have destroyed the vineyard of Sabama: the branches
thereof have reached even to Jazer: they have wandered in the
wilderness, the branches thereof are left, they are gone over the
sea.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore I will lament with the weeping of Jazer the
vineyard of Sabama: I will water thee with my tears, O Hesebon, and
Eleale: for the voice of the treaders hath rushed in upon thy
vintage, and upon thy harvest.</span></li>
<li><span>And gladness and joy shall be taken away from Carmel, and
there shall be no rejoicing nor shouting in the vineyards. He shall
not tread out wine in the press that was wont to tread it out: the
voice of the treaders I have taken away.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore my bowels shall sound like a harp for Moab, and
my inward parts for the brick wall.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is
wearied on his high places, that he shall go in to his sanctuaries
to pray, and shall not prevail.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the word, that the Lord spoke to Moab from that
time:</span></li>
<li><span>And now the Lord hath spoken, saying: In three years, as
the years of a hireling, the glory of Moab shall be taken away for
all the multitude of the people, and it shall be left small and
feeble, not many.</span></li>

<li><span>And the Lord of hosts shall make unto all people in this
mountain, a feast of fat things, a feast of wine, of fat things

<li><span>And he shall destroy in this mountain the face of the
bond with which all people were tied, and the web that he began
over all nations.</span></li>
<li><span>He shall cast death down headlong for ever: and the Lord
God shall wipe away tears from every face, and the reproach of his
people he shall take away from off the whole earth: for the Lord
hath spoken it.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall say in that day: Lo, this is our God, we
have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord, we have
patiently waited for him, we shall rejoice and be joyful in his
salvation.</span></li>
<li><span>For the hand of the Lord shall rest in this mountain: and
Moab shall be trodden down under him, as straw is broken in pieces

<li><span>Lord, let thy hand be exalted, and let them not see: let
the envious people see, and be confounded: and let fire devour thy
enemies.</span></li>

our works for us.</span></li>
<li><span>O Lord our God, other lords besides thee have had
dominion over us, only in thee let us remember thy
name.</span></li>
<li><span>Let not the dead live, let not the giants rise again:
therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and best destroyed
all their memory.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast been favourable to the nation, O Lord, thou
hast been favourable to the nation: art thou glorified? thou hast
removed all the ends of the earth far off.</span></li>
<li><span>Lord, they have sought after thee in distress, in the
tribulation of murmuring thy instruction was with them.</span></li>
<li><span>As a woman with child, when she draweth near the time of
her delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs: so are we
become in thy presence, O Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>We have conceived, and been as it were in labour, and
have brought forth wind: we have not wrought salvation on the
earth, therefore the inhabitants of the earth have not
fallen.</span></li>
<li><span>Thy dead men shall live, my slain shall rise again:
awake, and give praise, ye that dwell in the dust: for thy dew is
the dew of the light: and the land of the giants thou shalt pull

<li><span>Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim,
and to the fading flower the glory of his joy, who were on the head
of the fat valley, staggering with wine.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold the Lord is mighty and strong, as a storm of hail:
a destroying whirlwind, as the violence of many waters overflowing,
and sent forth upon a spacious land.</span></li>
<li><span>The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim shall be
trodden under feet.</span></li>
<li><span>And the fading flower the glory of his joy, who is on the
head of the fat valley, shall be as a hasty fruit before the
ripeness of autumn: which when he that seeth it shall behold, as
soon as he taketh it in his hand, he will eat it up.</span></li>
<li><span>In that day the Lord of hosts shall be a crown of glory,
and a garland of joy to the residue of his people:</span></li>
<li><span>And a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment,
and strength to them that return out of the battle to the
gate.</span></li>
<li><span>But these also have been ignorant through wine, and
through drunkenness have erred: the priest and the prophet have
been ignorant through drunkenness, they are swallowed up with wine,
they have gone astray in drunkenness, they have not known him that
seeth, they have been ignorant of judgment.</span></li>
<li><span>For all tables were full of vomit and filth, so that
there was no more place.</span></li>
<li><span>Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to
understand the hearing? them that are weaned from the milk, that
are drawn away from the breasts.</span></li>
<li><span>For command, command again; command, command again;
expect, expect again; expect, expect again: a little there, a
little there.</span></li>
<li><span>For with the speech of lips, and with another tongue he
will speak to this people.</span></li>
<li><span>To whom he said: This is my rest, refresh the weary, and
this is my refreshing: and they would not hear.</span></li>
<li><span>And the word of the Lord shall be to them: Command,
command again; command, command again: expect, expect again;
expect, expect again: a little there, a little there: that they may
go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and
taken.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore hear the word of the Lord, ye scornful men, who
rule over my people that is in Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>For you have said : We have entered into a league with
death, and we have made a covenant with hell. When the overflowing
scourge shall pass through, it shall not come upon us: for we have
placed our hope in lies, and by falsehood we are
protected.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will lay a
stone in the foundations of Sion, a tried stone, a corner stone, a
precious stone, founded in the foundation. He that believeth, let
him not hasten.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will set judgment in weight, and justice in
measure: and hail shall overturn the hope of falsehood: and waters
shall overflow its protection.</span></li>
<li><span>And Sour league with death shall be abolished, and your
covenant with hell shall not stand: when the overflowing scourge
shall pass, you shall be trodden down by it.</span></li>
<li><span>Whensoever it shall pass through, it shall take you away:
because in the morning early it shall pass through, in the day and
in the night, and vexation alone shall make you understand what you
hear.</span></li>
<li><span>For the bed is straitened, so that one must fall out, and
a short covering can- not cover both.</span></li>
<li><span>For the Lord shall stand up as in the mountain of
divisions: he shall be angry as in the valley which is in Gabaon:
that he may do his work, his strange work: that he may perform his
work, his work is strange to him.</span></li>
<li><span>And now do not mock, lest your bonds be tied strait. For
I have heard of the Lord the God of hosts a consumption and a
cutting short upon all the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>Give ear, and hear my voice, hearken, and hear my
speech.</span></li>
<li><span>Shall the ploughman plough all the day to sow, shall he
open and harrow his ground?</span></li>
<li><span>Will he not, when he hath made plain the surface thereof,
sow gith, and scatter cummin, and put wheat in order, and barley,
and millet, and vetches in their bounds?</span></li>
<li><span>For he will instruct him in judgment : his God will teach
him.</span></li>
<li><span>For gith shall not be thrashed with saws, neither shall
the cart wheel turn about upon cummin: but gith shall be beaten out
with a rod, and cummin with a staff.</span></li>
<li><span>But bread corn shall be broken small: but the thrasher
shall not thrash it for ever, neither shall the cart wheel hurt it,
nor break it with its teeth.</span></li>

make his counsel wonderful, and magnify justice.</span></li>

sorrow and mourning, and it shall be to me as Ariel.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will make a circle round about thee, and will cast
up a rampart against thee, and raise up bulwarks to besiege
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt be brought down, thou shalt speak out of the
earth, and thy speech shall be heard out of the ground: and thy
voice shall be from the earth like that of the python, and out of
the ground thy speech shall mutter.</span></li>
<li><span>And the multitude of them that fan thee, shall be like
small dust: and as ashes passing away, the multitude of them that
have prevailed against thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall be at an instant suddenly. A visitation
shall come from the Lord of hosts in thunder, and with earthquake,
and with a great noise of whirlwind and tempest, and with the flame

<li><span>And the multitude of all nations that have fought against
Ariel, shall be as the dream of a vision by night, and all that
have fought, and besieged and prevailed against it.</span></li>
<li><span>And as he that is hungry dreameth, and eateth, but when

and drinketh, and after he is awake, is yet faint with thirst, and
his soul is empty: so shall be the multitude of all the Gentiles,
that have fought against mount Sion.</span></li>
<li><span>Be astonished, and wander, waver, and stagger: be drunk,
and not with wine: stagger, and not with drunkenness.</span></li>
<li><span>For the Lord hath mingled for you the spirit of a deep
sleep, he will shut up your eyes, he will cover your prophets and
princes, that see visions.</span></li>
<li><span>And the vision of all shall be unto you as the words of a
book that is sealed, which when they shall deliver to one that is
learned, they shall say: Read this: and he shall answer: I cannot,
for it is sealed.</span></li>
<li><span>And the book shall be given to one that knoweth no
letters, and it shall be said to him: Read: and he shall answer: I
know no letters.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said: Forasmuch as this people draw near me
with their mouth, and with their lips glorify me, but their heart
is far from me, and they have feared me with the commandment and
doctrines of men:</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore behold I will proceed to cause an admiration in
this people, by a great and wonderful miracle: for wisdom shall
perish from their wise men, and the understanding of their prudent
men shall be hid.</span></li>
<li><span>Woe to you that are deep of heart, to hide your counsel
from the Lord: and their works are in the dark, and they say: Who
seeth us, and who knoweth us?</span></li>
<li><span>This thought of yours is perverse: as if the clay should
think against the potter, and the work should say to the maker
thereof: Thou madest me not: or the thing framed should say to him
that fashioned it: Thou understandest not.</span></li>
<li><span>Is it not yet a very little while, and Libanus shall be
turned into charmel, and charmel shall be esteemed as a

see.</span></li>
<li><span>And the meek shall increase their joy in the Lord, and
the poor men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>For he that did prevail hath failed, the scorner is
consumed, and they are all cut off that watched for
iniquity:</span></li>
<li><span>That made men sin by word, and supplanted him that
reproved them in the gate, and declined in vain from the
just.</span></li>

<li><span>Woe to you, apostate children, saith the Lord, that you
would take counsel, and not of me: and would begin a web, and not
by my spirit, that you might add sin upon sill:</span></li>
<li><span>Who walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my
mouth, hoping for help in the strength of Pharao, and trusting in
the shadow of Egypt.</span></li>
<li><span>And the- strength of Pharao shall be to your confusion,
and the confidence of the shadow of Egypt to your
shame.</span></li>
<li><span>For thy princes were in Tanis, and thy messengers came
even to Hanes.</span></li>
<li><span>They were all confounded at a people that could not
profit them: they were no help, nor to any profit, but to confusion
and to reproach.</span></li>
<li><span>The burden of the beasts of the south. In a land of
trouble and distress, from whence come the lioness, and the lion,
the viper and the flying basilisk, they carry their riches upon the
shoulders of beasts, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels
to a people that shall not be able to profit them.</span></li>
<li><span>For Egypt shall help in vain, and to no purpose:
therefore have I cried concerning this: It is pride only, sit
still.</span></li>
<li><span>Now therefore go in and write for them upon box, and note
it diligently in a book, and it shall be in the latter days for a
testimony for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>For it is a people that provoketh to wrath, and lying
children, children that will not hear the law of God.</span></li>
<li><span>Who say to the seers: See not: and to them that behold:
Behold not for us those things that are right: speak unto us
pleasant things, see errors for us.</span></li>
<li><span>Take away from me the way, turn away the path from me,
let the Holy One of Israel cease from before us.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel: Because you
have rejected this word, and have trusted in oppression and tumult,
and have leaned upon it:</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore shall this iniquity be to you as a breach that
falleth, and is found wanting in a high wall, for the destruction
thereof shall come on a sudden, when it is not looked
for.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall be broken small, as the potter's vessel is
broken all to pieces with mighty breaking, and there shall not a
sherd be found of the pieces thereof, wherein a little fire may be
carried from the hearth, or a, little water be drawn out of the
pit.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord God the Holy One of Israel: If
you return and be quiet, you shall be saved: in silence and in hope
shall your strength be. And you would not:</span></li>
<li><span>But have said: No, but we will flee to horses: therefore
shall you flee. And we will mount upon swift ones: therefore shall
they be swifter that shall pursue after you.</span></li>
<li><span>A thousand men shall flee for fear of one: and for fear
of five shall you flee, till you be left as the mast of a ship on
the top of a mountain, and as an ensign upon a hill.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore the Lord waiteth that be may have mercy on you:
and therefore shall he be exalted sparing you: because the Lord is
the God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for
him.</span></li>
<li><span>For the people of Sion shall dwell in Jerusalem: weeping
thou shalt not weep, he will surely have pity on thee: at the voice
of thy cry, se soon as he shell hear, he will answer
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord will give you spare bread, and short water:
and will not cause thy teacher to flee away from thee any more, and
thy eyes shall see thy teacher.</span></li>
<li><span>And thy ears shall hear the word of one admonishing thee
behind thy back: This is the way, walk ye in it: and go not aside
neither to the right hand, nor to the left.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt defile the plates of thy graven things of
silver, and the garment of thy molten things of gold, and shalt
cast them away as the uncleanness of a menstruous woman. Thou shalt
say to it: Get thee hence.</span></li>
<li><span>And rain shall be given to thy seed, wheresoever thou
shalt sow in the land: and the bread of the corn of the land shall
be most plentiful, and fat. The lamb in that day shall feed at
large in thy possession:</span></li>
<li><span>And thy oxen, and the ass colts that till the ground,
shall eat mingled pro vender as it was winnowed in the
floor.</span></li>
<li><span>And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon
every elevated hill rivers of running waters in the day of the
slaughter of many, when the tower shall fall.</span></li>
<li><span>And the light of the moon shall be se the light of the
sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of
seven days: in the day when the Lord shall bind up the wound of his
people, and shall heal the stroke of their wound.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold the name of the Lord cometh from afar, his wrath
burneth, and is heavy to bear: his lips are filled with
indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire.</span></li>
<li><span>His breath as a torrent overflowing even to the midst of
the neck, to destroy the nations unto nothing, and the bridle of
error that was in the jaws of the people.</span></li>
<li><span>You shall have a song as in the night of the sanctified
solemnity, and joy of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe, to come
into the mountain of the Lord, to the Mighty One of
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord shall make the glory of his voice to be
heard, and shall shew the terror of his arm, in the threatening of
wrath, and the dame of devouring fire: he shall crush to pieces
with whirlwind, and hailstones.</span></li>
<li><span>For at the voice of the Lord the Assyrian shall fear
being struck with the rod.</span></li>
<li><span>And the passage of the rod shall be strongly grounded,
which the Lord shall make to rest upon him with timbrels and harps,
and in great battles he shall over throw them.</span></li>

king, deep, and wide. The nourishment thereof is fire and much
wood: the breath of the Lord as a torrent of brimstone kindling

<li><span>Woe to thee that spoilest, shalt not thou thyself also be
spoiled? and thou that despisest, shalt not thyself also be
despised? when thou shalt have made an end of spoiling, thou shalt
be spoiled: when being wearied thou shalt cease to despise, thou

<li><span>O Lord, have mercy on us: for we have waited for thee: be
thou our arm in the morning, and our salvation in the time of
trouble.</span></li>
<li><span>At the voice of the angel the people fled, and at the
lifting up thyself the nations are scattered.</span></li>
<li><span>And your spoils shall be gathered together as the locusts
are gathered, as when the ditches are full of them.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord is magnified, for he hath dwelt on high: he hath
filled Sion with judgment and justice.</span></li>
<li><span>And there shall be faith in thy times: riches of
salvation, wisdom and knowledge: the fear of the Lord is his
treasure.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold they that see shall cry without, the angels of
peace shall weep bitterly.</span></li>
<li><span>The ways are made desolate, no one passeth by the road,
the covenant is made void, he hath rejected the cities, he hath not
regarded the men.</span></li>
<li><span>The land hath mourned, and languished: Libanus is
confounded and become foul, and Saron is become as a desert: and
Basan and Carmel are shaken.</span></li>
<li><span>Now will I rise up, saith the Lord: now will I be
exalted, now will I lift up myself.</span></li>
<li><span>You shall conceive heat, you shall bring forth stubble:
your breath as fire shall devour you.</span></li>
<li><span>And the people shall be as ashes after a fire, as a
bundle of thorns they shall be burnt with fire.</span></li>
<li><span>Hear, you that are far off, what I have done, and you
that are near know my strength.</span></li>
<li><span>The sinners in Sion are afraid, trembling hath seized
upon the hypocrites. Which of you can dwell with devouring fire?
which of you shall dwell with everlasting burnings?</span></li>
<li><span>He that walketh in justices, and speaketh truth, that
casteth away avarice by oppression, and shaketh his hands from all
bribes, that stoppeth his ears lest he hear blood, and shutteth his
eyes that he may see no evil.</span></li>
<li><span>He shall dwell on high, the fortifications of rocks shall
be his highness: bread is given him, his waters are
sure.</span></li>
<li><span>His eyes shall see the king in his beauty, they shall see
the land far off.</span></li>
<li><span>Thy heart shall meditate fear: where is the learned?
where is he that pondereth the words of the law? where is the
teacher of little ones?</span></li>
<li><span>The shameless people thou shalt not see, the people of
profound speech: so that thou canst not understand the eloquence of
his tongue, in whom there is no wisdom.</span></li>
<li><span>Look upon Sion the city of our solemnity: thy eyes shall
see Jerusalem, a rich habitation, a tabernacle that cannot be
removed: neither shall the nails thereof be taken away for ever,
neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken:</span></li>
<li><span>Because only there our Lord is magnificent: it place of
rivers, very broad and spacious streams: no ship with oars shall
pass by it, neither shall the great galley pass through
it.</span></li>
<li><span>For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the
Lord is our king: he will save us.</span></li>
<li><span>Thy tacklings are loosed, and they shall be of no

be able to spread the flag. Then shall the spoils of much prey be
divided: the lame shall take the spoil.</span></li>

habitation of dragons, and the pasture of ostriches.</span></li>
<li><span>And demons and monsters shall meet, and the hairy ones
shall cry out one to another, there hath the lamia lain down, and
found rest for herself.</span></li>
<li><span>There hath the ericius had its hole, and brought up its
young ones, and hath dug round about, and cherished them in the
shadow thereof: thither are the kites gathered together one to
another.</span></li>
<li><span>Search ye diligently in the book of the Lord, and read:
not one of them was wanting, one hath not sought for the other: for
that which proceedeth out of my mouth, he hath commanded, and his
spirit it hath gathered them.</span></li>

<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="36">Isaiah 36</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king
Ezechias, that Sennacherib king of the Assyrians came up against
all the fenced cities of Juda, and took them.</span></li>
<li><span>And the king of the Assyrians sent Rabsaces from Lachis
to Jerusalem, to king Ezechias with a great army, and he stood by
the conduit of the upper pool in the way of the fuller's
held.</span></li>
<li><span>And there went out to him Eliacim the son of Helcias, who
was over the house, and Sobna the scribe, and Joahe the son of
Asaph the recorder.</span></li>
<li><span>And Rabsaces said to them: Tell Ezechias: Thus saith the
great king, the king of the Assyrians: What is this confidence
wherein thou trustest?</span></li>
<li><span>Or with what counsel or strength dost thou prepare for
war? on whom dost thou trust, that thou art revolted from
me?</span></li>
<li><span>Lo thou trustest upon this broken staff of a reed, upon
Egypt: upon which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and
pierce it: so is Pharao king or Egypt to all that trust in
him.</span></li>
<li><span>But if thou wilt answer me: We trust in the Lord our God:
is it not he whose high places and altars Ezechias hath taken away,
and hath said to Juda and Jerusalem: You shall worship before this
altar?</span></li>
<li><span>And now deliver thyself up to my lord the king of the
Assyrians, and I will give thee two thousand horses, and thou wilt
not be able on thy part to find riders for them.</span></li>
<li><span>And how wilt thou stand against the face of the judge of
one place, of the least of my master's servants? But if thou trust
in Egypt, in chariots and in horsemen:</span></li>
<li><span>And am I now come up without the Lord against this land
to destroy it? The Lord said to me: Go up against this land, and
destroy it.</span></li>
<li><span>And Eliacim, and Sobna, and Joahe said to Rabsaces: Speak
to thy servants in the Syrian tongue: for we understand it: speak
not to us in the Jews' language in the hearing of the people, that
are upon the wall.</span></li>
<li><span>And Rabsaces said to them: Hath my master sent me to thy
master and to thee, to speak all these words; and not rather to the
men that sit on the wall; that they may eat their own dung, and
drink their urine with you?</span></li>
<li><span>Then Rabsaces stood, and cried out with a loud voice in
the Jews' language, and said: Hear the words of the great king, the
king of the Assyrians.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the king: Let not Ezechias deceive you, for he
shall not be able to deliver you.</span></li>
<li><span>And let not Ezechias make you trust in the Lord, saying:
The Lord will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given
into the hands of the king of the Assyrians.</span></li>
<li><span>Do not hearken to Ezechias: for thus said the king of the
Assyrians: Do with me that which is for your advantage, and come
out to me, and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his
dg tree, and drink ye every one the water of his
cistern,</span></li>
<li><span>Till I come and take you away to a land, like to your
own, a land of corn and of wine, a land of bread and
vineyards.</span></li>
<li><span>Neither let Ezechias trouble you, saying: The Lord will
deliver us. Have any of the gods of the nations delivered their
land out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians?</span></li>
<li><span>Where is the god of Emath and of Arphad? where is the god
of Sepharvaim? have they delivered Samaria out of my
hand?</span></li>
<li><span>Who is there among all the gods of these lands, that hath
delivered his country out of my hand, that the Lord may deliver
Jerusalem out of my hand?</span></li>
<li><span>And they held their peace, and answered him not a word.
For the king had commanded, saying: answer him not.</span></li>
<li><span>And Eliacim the son of Helcias, that was over the house,
and Sobna the scribe, and Joahe the son of Asaph the recorder, went
in to Ezechias with their garments rent, and told him the words of
Rabsaces.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="37">Isaiah 37</a></div>

<li><span>And it came to pass, when king Ezechias had heard it,
that he rent his garments and covered himself with sackcloth, and
went into the house of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And he sent Eliacim who was over the house, and Sobna the
scribe, and the ancients of the priests covered with sackcloth, to
Isaiah the son of Amos the prophet.</span></li>
<li><span>And they said to him: Thus saith Ezechias: This day is a
day of tribulation, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the
children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring
forth.</span></li>
<li><span>It may be the Lord thy God will hear the words of
Rabsaces, whom the king of the Assyrians his master hath sent to
blaspheme the living God, and to reproach with words which the Lord
thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant
that is left.</span></li>
<li><span>And the servants of Ezechias came to Isaiah.</span></li>
<li><span>And Isaiah said to them: Thus shall you say to your
master: Thus saith the Lord: Be not afraid of the words that thou
hast heard, with which the servants of the king of the Assyrians
have blasphemed me.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold, I will send a spirit upon him, and he shall hear
a message, and shall return to his own country, and I will cause
him to fall by the sword in his own country.</span></li>
<li><span>And Rabsaces returned, end found the king of the
Assyrians besieging Lobna. W For he had heard that he was departed
from Lachis.</span></li>
<li><span>And he heard say about Tharaca the king of Ethiopia: He
is come forth to fight against thee. And when he heard it, he sent
messengers to Ezechias, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus shall you speak to Ezechias the king of Juda,
saying: Let not thy God deceive thee, in whom thou trustest,
saying: Jerusalem shall not be given into the hands of the king of
the Assyrians.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold thou hast heard all that the kings of the
Assyrians hare done to all countries which they have destroyed, and
canst thou be delivered?</span></li>
<li><span>Have the gods of the nations delivered them whom my
fathers have destroyed, Gozam, and Haram, and Reseph, and the
children of Eden, that were in Thalassar?</span></li>
<li><span>Where is the king of Emath, and the king of Arphad, and
the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Ana, and of Ava?</span></li>
<li><span>And Ezechias took the letter from the hand of the
messengers, and read it, and went up to the house of the Lord, and
Ezechias spread it before the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And Ezechias prayed to the Lord, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, who sittest upon the
cherubims, thou alone art the God of all the kingdoms of the earth,
thou hast made heaven and earth.</span></li>
<li><span>Incline, O Lord, thy ear, and hear: open, O Lord, thy
eyes, and see, and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he hath
sent to blaspheme the living God.</span></li>
<li><span>For of a truth, O Lord, the kings of the Assyrians have
laid waste lands, and their countries.</span></li>
<li><span>And they have cast their gods into the fire, for they
were not gods, but the works of men's hands, of wood and stone: and
they broke them in pieces.</span></li>
<li><span>And now, O Lord our God, save us out of his hand: and let
all the kingdoms of the earth know, that thou only art the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And Isaiah the son of Amos sent to Ezechias, saying: Thus
saith the Lord the God of Israel: For the prayer thou hast made to
me concerning Sennacherib the king of the Assyrians:</span></li>
<li><span>This is the word which the Lord hath spoken of him: The
virgin the daughter of Sion hath despised thee, and laughed thee to
scorn: the daughter of Jerusalem hath wagged the head after
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Whom hast thou reproached, and whom hast thou blasphemed,
and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thy
eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>By the hand of thy servants thou hast reproached the
Lord: and hast said: With the multitude of my chariots I have gone
up to the height of the mountains, to the top of Libanus: and I
will out down its tall cedars, and its choice fir trees, end will
enter to the top of its height, to the forest of its
Carmel.</span></li>
<li><span>I have digged, and drunk water, and have dried up with
the sole of my foot, all the rivers shut up in banks.</span></li>
<li><span>Hast thou not heard what I have done to him of old? from
the days of old I have formed it: and now I have brought it to
effect: and it hath come to pass that hills fighting together, and
fenced cities should be destroyed.</span></li>
<li><span>The inhabitants of them were weak of hand, they trembled,
and were confounded: they became like the grass of the field, and
the herb of the pasture, and like the grass of the housetops, which
withered before it was ripe.</span></li>
<li><span>I know thy dwelling, and thy going out, and thy coming
in, and thy rage against me.</span></li>
<li><span>When thou wast mad against me, thy pride came up to my
ears: therefore I will put a ring in thy nose, and a bit between
thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou
camest.</span></li>
<li><span>But to thee this shall be a sign: Eat this year the
things that spring of themselves, and in the second year eat
fruits: but in the third year sow and reap, and giant vineyards,
and eat the fruit of them.</span></li>
<li><span>And that which shall be saved of the house of Juda, and
which is left, shall take root downward, and shall bear fruit
upward :</span></li>
<li><span>For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a, remnant, and
salvation from mount Sion: the zeal of the Lord of hosts shall do
this.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of the
Assyrians: He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow
into it, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a trench about
it.</span></li>
<li><span>By the way that he came, he shall return, and into this
city he shall not come, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will protect this city, and will save it for my own
sake, and for the sake of David my servant.</span></li>
<li><span>And the angel of the Lord went out, and slew in the camp
of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand. And they arose
in the morning, and behold they were all dead corpses.</span></li>
<li><span>And Sennacherib the king of the Assyrians went out and
departed, and returned, and dwelt in Ninive.</span></li>
<li><span>And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the temple
of Nesroch his god, that Adramelech and Sarasar his sons slew him
with the sword: and they fled into the land of Ararat, and
Asarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.</span></li>

to the Lord,</span></li>
<li><span>And said: I beseech thee, O Lord, remember how I have
walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have
done that which is good in thy sight. And Ezechias wept with great
weeping.</span></li>
<li><span>And the word of the Lord came to Isaiah,
saying:</span></li>

<li><span>My generation is at an end, and it is rolled away from

<li><span>I hoped till morning, as a lion so hath he broken all my

<li><span>I will cry like a young swallow, I will meditate like a

answer thou for me.</span></li>
<li><span>What shall I say, or what shall he answer for me, whereas
he himself hath done it? I will recount to thee all my years in the
bitterness of my soul.</span></li>
<li><span>O Lord, if man's life be such, and the life of my spirit
be in such things as these, thou shalt correct me, and make me to
live.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold in peace is my bitterness most bitter: but thou
best delivered my soul that it should not perish, thou hast cast
all my sins behind thy back.</span></li>
<li><span>For hell shall not confess to thee, neither shall death
praise thee: nor shall they that go down into the pit, look for thy
truth.</span></li>
<li><span>The living, the living, he shall give praise to thee, as
I do this day: the father shall make thy truth known to the

and weighed the heavens with his palm? who hath poised with three
fingers the bulk of the earth, and weighed the mountains in scales,
and the hills in a balance?</span></li>
<li><span>Who hath forwarded the spirit of the Lord? or who hath
been his counsellor, and hath taught him?</span></li>
<li><span>With whom hath he consulted, and who hath instructed him,
and taught him the path of justice, and taught him knowledge, and
shewed him the way of understanding?</span></li>
<li><span>Behold the Gentiles are as a drop of a bucket, and are
counted as the smallest grain of a balance: behold the islands are
as a little dust.</span></li>
<li><span>And Libanus shall not be enough to burn, nor the beasts
thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.</span></li>
<li><span>All nations are before him as if they had no being at
all, and are counted to him as nothing, and vanity.</span></li>
<li><span>To whom then have you likened God? or what image will you
make for him?</span></li>
<li><span>Hath the workman cast a graven statue? or hath the
goldsmith formed it with gold, or the silversmith with plates of
silver?</span></li>
<li><span>He hath chosen strong wood, and that will not rot: the
skilful workman seeketh how he may set up an idol that may not be
moved.</span></li>
<li><span>Do you not know? hath it not been heard? hath it not been
told you from the beginning? have you not understood the
foundations of the earth ?</span></li>
<li><span>It is he that sitteth upon the globe of the earth, and
the inhabitants thereof are as locusts: he that stretcheth out the
heavens as nothing, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell
in.</span></li>
<li><span>He that bringeth the searchers of secrets to nothing,
that hath made the judges of the earth as vanity.</span></li>
<li><span>And surely their stock was neither planted, nor sown, nor
rooted in the earth: suddenly he hath blown upon them, and they are
withered, and a whirlwind shall take them away as
stubble.</span></li>
<li><span>And to whom have ye likened me, or made me equal, saith
the Holy One?</span></li>
<li><span>Lift up your eyes on high, and see who hath created these
things: who bringeth out their host by number, and calleth them all
by their names: by the greatness of his might, and strength, and
power, not one of them was missing.</span></li>
<li><span>Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel: My way
is hid from the Lord, and my judgment is passed over from my
God?</span></li>
<li><span>Knowest thou not, or hast thou not heard? the Lord is the
everlasting God, who hath created the ends of the earth: he shall
not faint, nor labour, neither is there any searching out of his
wisdom.</span></li>
<li><span>It is he that giveth strength to the weary, and
increaseth force and might to them that are not.</span></li>
<li><span>Youths shall faint, and labour, and young men shall fall
by infirmity.</span></li>
<li><span>But they that hope in the Lord shall renew their
strength, they shall take wings as eagles, they shall run and not
be weary, they shall walk and not faint.</span></li>

<li><span>Let the islands keep silence before me, and the nations
take new strength: let them come near, and then speak, let us come
near to judgment together.</span></li>
<li><span>Who hath raised up the just one from the east, hath
called him to follow him? he shall give the nations in his sight,
and he shall rule over kings: he shall give them as the dust to his
sword, as stubble driven by the wind, to his bow.</span></li>
<li><span>He shall pursue them, he shall pass in peace, no path
shall appear after his feet.</span></li>
<li><span>Who hath wrought and done these things, calling the
generations from the beginning? I the Lord, I am the first and the
last.</span></li>
<li><span>The islands saw it, and feared, the ends of the earth
were astonished, they drew near, and came.</span></li>
<li><span>Every one shall help his neighbour, and shall say to his
brother: Be of good courage.</span></li>
<li><span>The coppersmith striking with the hammer encouraged him
that forged at that time, saying: It is ready for soldering: and he
strengthened it with nails, that it should not be
moved.</span></li>
<li><span>But thou Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have
chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend:</span></li>
<li><span>In whom I have taken thee from the ends of the earth, and
from the remote parts thereof have called thee, and said to thee:
Thou art my servant, I have chosen thee, and have not cast thee
away.</span></li>
<li><span>Fear not, for I am with thee: turn not aside, for I am
thy God: I have strengthened thee, and have helped thee, and the
right hand of my just one hath upheld thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold all that fight against thee shall be confounded
and ashamed, they shall be as nothing, and the men shall perish
that strive against thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find the men that
resist thee: they shall be as nothing: and as a thing consumed the
men that war against thee.</span></li>
<li><span>For I am the Lord thy God, who take thee by the hand, and
say to thee: Fear not, I have helped thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Fear not, thou worm of Jacob, you that are dead of
Israel: I have helped thee, saith the Lord: and thy Redeemer the
Holy One of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>I have made thee as a new thrashing wain, with teeth like
a saw: thou shall thrash the mountains, and break them in pieces:
and shalt make the hills as chaff.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away,
and the whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in the
Lord, in the Holy One of Israel thou shalt be joyful.</span></li>
<li><span>The needy and the poor seek for waters, and there are
none: their tongue hath been dry with thirst. I the Lord will hear
them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.</span></li>
<li><span>I will open rivers in the high bills, and fountains in
the midst of the plains: I will turn the desert into pools of
waters, and the impassable land into streams of waters.</span></li>
<li><span>I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, and the thorn,
and the myrtle, and the olive tree: I will set in the desert the
fir tree, the elm, and the box tree together:</span></li>
<li><span>That they may see and know, and consider, and understand
together that the hand of the Lord hath done this, and the Holy One
of Israel hath created it.</span></li>
<li><span>Bring your cause near, saith the Lord: bring hither, if
you have any thing to allege, saith the King of Jacob.</span></li>
<li><span>Let them come, and tell us all things that are to come:
tell us the former things what they were: and we will set our heart
upon them, and shall know the latter end of them, and tell us the
things that are to come.</span></li>
<li><span>Shew the things that are to come hereafter, and we shall
know that ye are gods. Do ye also good or evil, if you can: and let
us speak, and see together.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold, you are of nothing, and your work of that which
hath no being: he that hath chosen you is an
abomination.</span></li>
<li><span>I have raised up one from the north, and he shall come
from the rising of the sun: he shall call upon my name, and he
shall make princes to be as dirt, and as the potter treading
clay.</span></li>
<li><span>Who bath declared from the beginning, that we may know:
and from time of old, that we may say: Thou art just. There is none
that sheweth, nor that foretelleth, nor that heareth your
words.</span></li>
<li><span>The first shall say to Sion: Behold they are here, and to
Jerusalem I will give an evangelist.</span></li>
<li><span>And I saw, and there was no one even among them to
consult, or who, when I asked, could answer a word.</span></li>

<li><span>Behold my servant, I will uphold him: my elect, my soul
delighteth in him: I have given my spirit upon him, he shall bring
forth judgment to the Gentiles.</span></li>
<li><span>He shall not cry, nor have respect to person, neither
shall his voice be heard abroad.</span></li>
<li><span>The bruised reed he shall not break, and smoking flax he
shall not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto
truth.</span></li>
<li><span>He shall not be sad, nor troublesome, till he set
judgment in the earth: and the islands shall wait for his
law.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord God that created the heavens, and
stretched them out: that established the earth, and the things that
spring out of it: that giveth breath to the people upon it, and
spirit to them that tread thereon.</span></li>
<li><span>I the Lord have called thee in justice, and taken thee by
the hand, and preserved thee. And I have given thee for a covenant
of the people, for a light of the Gentiles:</span></li>
<li><span>That thou mightest open the eyes of the blind, and bring
forth the prisoner out of prison, and them that sit in darkness out
of the prison house.</span></li>
<li><span>I the Lord, this is my name: I will not give my glory to
another, nor my praise to graven things.</span></li>
<li><span>The things that were first, behold they are come: and new
things do I declare: before they spring forth, I will make you head
them.</span></li>
<li><span>Sing ye to the Lora a new song, his praise is from the
ends of the earth: you that go down to the sea, and all that are
therein: ye islands, and ye inhabitants of them.</span></li>
<li><span>Let the desert and the cities thereof be exalted: Cedar
shall dwell in houses: ye inhabitants of Petra, give praise, they
shall cry from the top of the mountains.</span></li>
<li><span>They shall give glory to the Lord, and shall declare his
praise in the islands.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord shall go forth as a mighty man, as a man of war
shall he stir up zeal: he shall shout and cry: he shall prevail
against his enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>I have always held my peace, I have I kept silence, I
have been patient, I will speak now as a woman in labour: I will
destroy, and swallow up at once.</span></li>
<li><span>I will lay waste the mountains and hills, and will make
all their grass to wither: and I will turn rivers into islands, and
will dry up the standing pools.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will lead the blind into the way which they know
not: and in the paths which they were ignorant of I will make them
walk: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things
straight: these things have I done to them, and have not forsaken
them.</span></li>
<li><span>They are turned back: let them be greatly confounded,
that trust in a graven thing, that say to a molten thing: You are
our god.</span></li>
<li><span>Hear, ye deaf, and, ye blind, behold that you may
see.</span></li>
<li><span>Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, but he to whom I
have sent my messengers? Who is blind, but he that is sold? or who
is blind, but the servant of the Lord?</span></li>
<li><span>Thou that seest many things, wilt thou not observe them?
thou that hast ears open, wilt thou not hear?</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord was willing to sanctify him, and to magnify
the law, and exalt it.</span></li>
<li><span>But this is a people that is robbed and wasted: they are
all the snare of young men, and they are hid in the houses of
prisons: they are made a prey, and there is none to deliver them: a
spoil, and there is none that saith: Restore.</span></li>
<li><span>Who is there among you that will give ear to this, that
will attend and hearken for times to come?</span></li>
<li><span>Who hath given Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to robbers?

would not walk in his ways, and they have not hearkened to his
law.</span></li>

fury, and a strong battle, and hath burnt him round about, and he
knew not: and set him on fire, and he understood not.</span></li>

called thee by thy name: thou art mine.</span></li>
<li><span>When thou shalt pass through the waters, I will be with
thee, and the rivers shall not cover thee: when thou shalt walk in
the fire, thou shalt not be burnt, and the flames shall not burn in

<li><span>For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy
Saviour: I have given Egypt for thy atonement, Ethiopia and Saba
for thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Since thou becamest honourable in my eyes, thou art
glorious: I have loved thee, and I will give men for thee, and
people for thy life.</span></li>
<li><span>Fear not, for I am with thee: I will. bring thy seed from
the east, and gather thee from the west.</span></li>
<li><span>I will say to the north: Give up: and to the south: Keep
not back: bring my sons from afar, and my daughters from the ends

<li><span>And every one that calleth upon my name, I have created
him for my glory, I have formed him, and made him.</span></li>
<li><span>Bring forth the people that are blind, and have eyes:
that are deaf, and have ears.</span></li>
<li><span>All the nations are assembled together, and the tribes
are gathered: who among you can declare this, and shall make us
hear the former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, let
them be justified, and hear, and say: It is truth.</span></li>
<li><span>You are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom
I have chosen: that you may know, and believe me, and understand
that I myself am. Before me there was no God formed, and after me
there shall be none.</span></li>
<li><span>I am, I am the Lord: and there is no saviour besides
me.</span></li>
<li><span>I have declared, and have saved. I have made it heard,
and there was no strange one among you. You are my witnesses, saith
the Lord, and I am God.</span></li>
<li><span>And from the beginning I am the same, and there is none
that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall turn it
away?</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord your redeemer, the Holy One of
Israel: For your sake I sent to Babylon, and have brought down all
their bars, and the Chaldeans glorying in their ships.</span></li>
<li><span>I am the Lord your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your
King.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord, who made a way in the sea, and a
path in the mighty waters.</span></li>
<li><span>Who brought forth the chariot and the horse, the army and
the strong: they lay down to sleep together, and they shall not
rise again: they are broken as flax, and are extinct.</span></li>
<li><span>Remember not former things, and look not on things of
old.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I do new things, and now they shall spring forth,
verily you shall know them: I will make a way in the wilderness,
and rivers in the desert.</span></li>
<li><span>The beast of the field shall glorify me, the dragons and
the ostriches: because I have given waters in the wilderness,
rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, to my
chosen.</span></li>
<li><span>This people have I formed for my- self, they shall shew
forth my praise.</span></li>
<li><span>But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob, neither hast
thou laboured about me, O Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast not offered me the ram of thy holocaust, nor
hast thou glorified me with thy victims: I have not caused thee to
serve with oblations, nor wearied thee with incense.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither
hast thou filled me with the fat of thy victims. But thou hast made
me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thy
iniquities.</span></li>
<li><span>I am, I am he that blot out thy iniquities for my own
sake, and I will not remember thy sins.</span></li>
<li><span>Put me in remembrance, and let us plead together: tell if
thou hast any thing to justify thyself.</span></li>
<li><span>Thy brat father sinned, and thy teachers have
transgressed against me.</span></li>

<li><span>Who is like to me? let him call and declare: and let him
set before me the order, since I appointed the ancient people: and
the things to come, and that shall be hereafter, let them shew unto
them.</span></li>
<li><span>Fear ye not, neither be ye troubled, from that time I
have made thee to hear, and have declared: you are my witnesses. Is
there a God besides me, a maker, whom I have not known?</span></li>
<li><span>The makers of idols are all of them nothing, and their
best beloved things shall not profit them. They are their
witnesses, that they do not see, nor understand, that they may be
ashamed.</span></li>
<li><span>Who hath formed a god, and made a graven thing that is
profitable for nothing?</span></li>
<li><span>Behold, all the partakers thereof shall be confounded:
for the makers are men: they shall all assemble together, they
shall stand and fear, and shall be confounded together.</span></li>
<li><span>The smith hath wrought with his file, with coals, and
with hammers he hath formed it, and hath wrought with the strength
of his arm: he shall hunger and faint, he shall drink no water, and
shall be weary.</span></li>
<li><span>The carpenter hath stretched out his rule, he hath formed
it with a plane: he hath made it with corners, and hath fashioned
it round with the compass: and he hath made the image of a man as
it were a beautiful man dwelling in a house.</span></li>
<li><span>He hath cut down cedars, taken the holm, and the oak that
stood among the trees of the forest: he hath planted the pine tree,
which the rain hath nourished.</span></li>
<li><span>And it hath served men for fuel: he took thereof, and
warmed himself: and he kindled it, and baked bread: but of the rest
he made a god, and adored it: he made a graven thing, and bowed
down before it.</span></li>
<li><span>Part of it he burnt with fire, and with part of it he
dressed his meat: he boiled pottage, and was filled, and was
warmed, and said: Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire.</span></li>
<li><span>But the residue thereof he made a god, and a graven thing
for himself: he boweth down before it, and adoreth it, and prayeth
unto it, saying: Deliver me, for thou art my God.</span></li>
<li><span>They have not known, nor understood: for their eyes are
covered that they may not see, and that they may not understand
with their heart.</span></li>
<li><span>They do not consider in their mind, nor know, nor have
the thought to say: I have burnt part of it in the fire, and I have
baked bread upon the coals thereof: I have broiled flesh and have
eaten, and of the residue thereof shall I make an idol? shall I
fall down before the stock of a tree?</span></li>
<li><span>Part thereof is ashes: his foolish heart adoreth it, and
he will not save his soul, nor say: Perhaps there is a lie in my
right hand.</span></li>
<li><span>Remember these things, O Jacob, and Israel, for thou art
my servant. I have formed thee, thou art my servant, O Israel,
forget me not.</span></li>
<li><span>I have blotted out thy iniquities as a cloud, and thy
sins as a mist: return to me, for I have redeemed thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Give praise, O ye heavens, for the Lord hath shewn mercy:
shout with joy, ye ends of the earth: ye mountains, resound with
praise, thou, O forest, and every tree therein: for the Lord hath
redeemed Jacob, and Israel shall be glorified.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord thy redeemer, and thy maker, from the
womb: I am the Lord, that make all things, that alone stretch out
the heavens, that establish the earth, and there is none with
me.</span></li>
<li><span>That make void the tokens of diviners, and make the
soothsayers mad. That turn the wise backward, and that, make their
knowledge foolish.</span></li>

riches of secret places: that thou mayest know that I am the Lord
who call thee by thy name, the God of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>For the sake of my servant Jacob, and Israel my elect, I
have even called thee by thy name: I have made a likeness of thee,
and thou hast not known me.</span></li>
<li><span>I am the Lord, and there is none else: there is no God,
besides me: I girded thee, and thou hast not known me:</span></li>
<li><span>That they may know who are from the rising of the sun,

earthen pots: shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it: What
art thou making, and thy work is without hands?</span></li>
<li><span>Woe to him that saith to his father: Why begettest thou?
and to the woman: Why dost thou bring forth?</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord the Holy One of Israel, his maker:
Ask me of things to come, concerning my children, and concerning
the work of my hands give ye charge to me.</span></li>
<li><span>I made the earth: and I created man upon it: my hand
stretched forth the heavens, and I have commanded all their
host.</span></li>
<li><span>I have raised him up to justice, and I will direct all
his ways: he shall build my city, and let go my captives, not for
ransom, nor for presents, saith the Lord the God of
hosts.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: The labour of Egypt, and the
merchandise of Ethiopia, and of Sabaim, men of stature shall come
over to thee, and shall be thins: they shall walk after thee, they
shall go bound with manacles: and they shall worship thee, and
shall make supplication to thee: only in thee is God, and there is
no God besides thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Verily thou art a hidden God, the God of Israel the
saviour.</span></li>
<li><span>They are all confounded and ashamed: the forgers of
errors are gone together into confusion.</span></li>
<li><span>Israel is saved in the Lord with as eternal salvation:
you shall not be con- founded, and you shall not be ashamed for
ever and ever.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens, God
himself that formed the earth, and made it, the very maker thereof:
he did not create it in vain: he formed it to be inhabited. I am
the Lord, and there is no other.</span></li>
<li><span>I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the
earth: I have not said to the seed of Jacob: Seek me in vain. I am
the Lord that speak justice, that declare right things.</span></li>
<li><span>Assemble yourselves, and come, and draw near together, ye
that are saved of the Gentiles: they have no knowledge that set up

save.</span></li>
<li><span>Tell ye, and come, and consult together: who hath
declared this from the beginning, who hath foretold this from that
time? Have not I the Lord, and there is no God else besides me? A

<li><span>Be converted to me, and you shall be saved, all ye ends
of the earth: for I am God, and there is no other.</span></li>

shall swear.</span></li>

place. Yea, when they shall cry also unto him, he shall not hear:
he shall not save them from tribulation.</span></li>
<li><span>Remember this, and be ashamed: return, ye transgressors,
to the heart.</span></li>
<li><span>Remember the former age, for I am God, and there is no
God beside, neither is there the like to me:</span></li>
<li><span>Who shew from the beginning the things that shall be at
last, and from ancient times the things that as yet are not done,
saying: My counsel shall stand, and all my will shall be
done:</span></li>
<li><span>Who call a bird from the east, and from a far country the
man of my own will, and I have spoken, and will bring it to pass: I
have created, and I will do it. Hear me, O ye hardhearted, who are
far from justice.</span></li>
<li><span>I have brought my justice near, it shall not be afar off:
and my salvation shall not tarry. I will give salvation in Sion,
and my glory in Israel.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>Come down, sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon,
sit on the ground: there is no throne for the daughter of the
Chaldeans, for thou shalt no more be called delicate and
tender.</span></li>
<li><span>Take a millstone and grind meal: uncover thy shame, strip
thy shoulder, make bare thy legs, pass over the rivers.</span></li>
<li><span>Thy nakedness shall be discovered, and thy shame shall be
seen: I will take vengeance, and no man shall resist
me.</span></li>
<li><span>Our redeemer, the Lord of hosts is his name, the Holy One
of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter
of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called the lady of
kingdoms.</span></li>
<li><span>I was angry with my people, I have polluted my
inheritance, and have given them into thy bend: thou hast shewn no
mercy to them: upon the ancient thou hast laid thy yoke exceeding
heavy.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou hast said: I shall be a lady for ever: thou hast
not laid these things to thy heart, neither hast thou remembered
thy latter end.</span></li>
<li><span>And now hear these things, thou that art delicate, and
dwellest confidently, that sayest in thy heart: I am, and there is
none else besides me: I shall not sit as a widow, and I shall not
know barrenness.</span></li>
<li><span>These two things shall come upon thee suddenly in one
day, barrenness and widowhood. All things are come upon thee,
because of the multitude of thy sorceries, and for the great
hardness of thy enchanters.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou best trusted in thy wickedness, and hast said:
There is none that seeth me. Thy wisdom, and thy knowledge, this
hath deceived thee. And thou best said in thy heart: I am, and
besides me there is no other.</span></li>
<li><span>Evil shall come upon thee, and then shalt not know the
rising thereof: and calamity shall fall violently upon thee, which
thou canst not keep off: misery shall come upon thee suddenly,
which thou shalt not know.</span></li>
<li><span>Stand now with thy enchanters, and with the multitude of
thy sorceries, in which thou hast laboured from thy youth, if so be
it may profit thee any thing, or if thou mayst become
stronger.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast failed in the multitude or thy counsels: let
now the astrologers stand and save thee, they that gazed at the
stars, and counted the months, that from them they might tell the
things that shall come to thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold they are as stubble, fire hath burnt them, they
shall not deliver them- selves from the power of the dames: there
are no coals wherewith they may be warmed, nor fire, that they may
sit thereat.</span></li>
<li><span>Such are all the things become to thee, in which thou
best laboured: thy merchants from thy youth, every one hath erred
in his own way, there is none that can save thee.</span></li>

<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="48">Isaiah 48</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Hear ye these things, O house of Jacob, you that are
called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters
of Juda, you who swear by the name of the Lord, and make mention of
the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in justice.</span></li>
<li><span>For they are called of the holy city, and are established
upon the God of Israel: the Lord of hosts is his name.</span></li>
<li><span>The former things of old I have declared, and they went
forth out of my mouth, and I have made them to be heard: I did them
suddenly and they came to pass.</span></li>
<li><span>For I knew that thou art stubborn, and thy neck is as an
iron sinew, and thy forehead as brass.</span></li>
<li><span>I foretold thee of old, before they came to pass I told
thee, lest thou shouldst say: My idols have done these things, and
my graven and molten things have commanded them.</span></li>
<li><span>See now all the things which thou hast heard: but have
you declared them? I have shewn thee new things from that time, and
things are kept which thou knowest not:</span></li>
<li><span>They are created now, and not of old: and before the day,
when thou heardest them not, lest thou shouldst say: Behold I knew
them.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast neither heard, nor known, neither was thy ear
opened of old. For I know that transgressing thou wilt transgress,
and I have called thee a transgressor from the womb.</span></li>
<li><span>For my name's sake I will remove my wrath far off: and
for my praise I will bridle thee, lest thou shouldst
perish.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I have refined thee, but not as silver, I have
chosen thee in the furnace of poverty.</span></li>
<li><span>For my own sake, for my own sake will I do it, that I may
not be blasphemed: and I will not give my glory to
another.</span></li>
<li><span>Hearken to me, O Jacob, and thou Israel whom I call: I am
he, I am the first, and I am the last.</span></li>
<li><span>My hand also hath founded the earth, and my right hand
hath measured the heavens: I shall call them, and they shall stand
together.</span></li>
<li><span>Assemble yourselves together, all you, and hear: who
among them hath declared these things? the Lord hath loved him, he
will do his pleasure in Babylon, and his arm shall be on the
Chaldeans.</span></li>
<li><span>I, even I have spoken and called him: I have brought him,
and his way is made prosperous.</span></li>
<li><span>Come ye near unto me, and hear this: I have not spoken in
secret from the beginning: from the time before it was done, I was
there, and now the Lord God hath sent me, and his
spirit.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord thy redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:
I am the Lord thy God that teach thee profitable things, that
govern thee in the way that thou walkest.</span></li>
<li><span>O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments: thy peace
had been as a river, and thy justice as the waves of the
sea,</span></li>
<li><span>And thy seed had been as the sand, and the offspring of
thy bowels like the gravel thereof: his name should not have
perished, nor have been destroyed from before my face.</span></li>
<li><span>Come forth out of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans,
declare it with the voice of joy: make this to be heard, and speak
it out even to the ends of the earth. Say: The Lord hath redeemed
his servant Jacob.</span></li>
<li><span>They thirsted not in the desert, when he led them out: he
brought forth water out of the rock for them, and he clove the
rock, and the waters gushed out.</span></li>
<li><span>There is no peace to the wicked, saith the
Lord.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="49">Isaiah 49</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Give ear, ye islands, and hearken, ye people from afar.
The Lord hath called me from the womb, from the bowels of my mother
he hath been mindful of my name.</span></li>
<li><span>And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword: in the
shadow of his hand he hath protected me, and hath made me as a
chosen arrow: in his quiver he hath hidden me.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to me: Thou art my servant Israel, for in
thee will I glory.</span></li>
<li><span>And I said: I have laboured in vain, I have spent my
strength without cause and in vain: therefore my judgment is with
the Lord, and my work with my God.</span></li>
<li><span>And now saith the Lord, that formed me from the womb to
be his servant, that I may bring back Jacob unto him, and Israel
will not be gathered together: and I am glorified in the eyes of
the Lord, and my God is made my strength.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said: It is a small thing that thou shouldst be my
servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to convert the dregs
of Israel. Behold, I have given thee to be the light of the
Gentiles, that thou mayst be my salvation even to the farthest part
of the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord the redeemer of Israel, his Holy One,
to the soul that is despised, to the nation that is abhorred, to
the servant of rulers: Kings shall see, end princes shall rise up,
and adore for the Lord's sake, because he is faithful, and for the
Holy One of Israel, who hath chosen thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: In an acceptable time I have heard
thee, and in the day of salvation I have helped thee: and I have
preserved thee, and given thee to be a covenant of the people, that
thou mightest raise up the earth, and possess the inheritances that
were destroyed:</span></li>
<li><span>That thou mightest say to them that are bound: Come
forth: and to them that are in darkness: Shew yourselves. They
shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in every
plain.</span></li>
<li><span>They shall not hunger, nor thirst, neither shall the heat
nor the sun strike them: for he that is merciful to them, shall be
their shepherd, and at the fountains of waters he shall give them
drink.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will make all my mountains a way, and my paths
shall be exalted.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold these shall come from afar, and behold these from
the north and from the sea, and these from the south
country.</span></li>
<li><span>Give praise, O ye heavens, and rejoice, O earth, ye
mountains, give praise with jubilation: because the Lord hath
comforted his people, and will have mercy on his poor
ones.</span></li>
<li><span>And Sion said: The Lord hath forsaken me, and the Lord
hath forgotten me.</span></li>
<li><span>Can a woman forget her infant, so as not to have pity on
the son of her womb? and if she should forget, yet will not I
forget thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold, I have graven thee in my hands: thy walls are
always before my eyes.</span></li>
<li><span>Thy builders are come: they that destroy thee and make
thee waste shall go out of thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Lift up thy eyes round about, and see all these are
gathered together, they are come to thee: I live, saith the Lord,
thou shalt be clothed with all these se with an ornament, and as a
bride thou shalt put them about thee.</span></li>
<li><span>For thy deserts, and thy desolate places, and the land of
thy destruction shall now be too narrow by reason of the
inhabitants, end they that swallowed thee up shall be chased far
away.</span></li>
<li><span>The children of thy barrenness shall still say in thy
ears: The place is too strait for me, make me room to dwell
in.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt-say in thy heart: Who hath begotten these?
I was barren and brought not forth, led away, and captive: and who
hath brought up these? I was destitute and alone: and these, where
were they?</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will lift up my hand to
the Gentiles, and will set up my standard to the people. And they
shall bring thy sons in their arms, and carry thy daughters upon
their shoulders.</span></li>
<li><span>And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and queens thy
nurses: they shall worship thee with their face toward the earth,
and they shall lick up the dust of thy feet. And thou shalt know
that I am the Lord, for they shall not be confounded that wait for
him.</span></li>
<li><span>Shall the prey be taken from the strong? or can that
which was taken by the mighty be delivered?</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord: Yea verily, even the captivity
shall be taken away from the strong: and that which was taken by
the mighty, shall be delivered. But I will judge those that have
judged thee, and thy children I will save.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will feed thy enemies with their own flesh: and
they shall be made drunk with their own blood, as with new wine:
and all flesh shall know, that I am the Lord that save thee, and
thy Redeemer the Mighty One of Jacob.</span></li>

your mother, with which I have put her away? or who is my creditor,
to whom I sold you: behold you are sold for your iniquities, and
for your wicked deeds have I put your mother away.</span></li>
<li><span>Because I came, and there was not a man: I called, and
there was none that would hear. Is my hand shortened and become
little, that I cannot redeem? or is there no strength in me to
deliver? Behold at my rebuke I will make the sea a desert, I will
turn the rivers into dry land: the fishes shall rot for want of
water, and shall die for thirst.</span></li>
<li><span>I will clothe the heavens with darkness, and will make
sackcloth their covering.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord hath given me a learned tongue, that I should
know how to uphold by word him that is weary: he wakeneth in the
morning, in the morning he wakeneth my ear, that I may hear him as
a master.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord God hath opened my ear, and I do not resist: I
have not gone back.</span></li>
<li><span>I have given my body to the strikers, and my cheeks to
them that plucked them: I have not turned away my face from them
that rebuked me, and spit upon me.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord God is my helper, therefore am I not confounded:
therefore have I set my face as a most hard rock, and I know that I
shall not be confounded.</span></li>
<li><span>He is near that justifieth me, who will contend with me?
let us stand together, who is my adversary? let him come near to
me.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold the Lord God is my helper: who is he that shall
condemn me? Lo, they shall all be destroyed as a garment, the moth
shall eat them up.</span></li>
<li><span>Who is there among you that feareth the Lord, that
heareth the voice of his servant, that hath walked in darkness, and
hath no light? let him hope in the name of the Lord, and lean upon
his God.</span></li>

<li><span>Look unto Abraham your father, and to Sara that bore you:
for I called him alone, and blessed him, and multiplied
him.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord therefore will comfort Sion, and will comfort
all the ruins thereof: and he will make her desert as a place of
pleasure, and her wilderness as the garden of the Lord. Joy and
gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of
praise.</span></li>
<li><span>Hearken unto me, O my people, and give ear to me, O my
tribes: for a law shall go forth from me, and my judgment shall
rest to be a light of the nations.</span></li>
<li><span>My just one is near at hand, my saviour is gone forth,
and my arms shall judge the people: the islands shall look for me,

<li><span>Lift up your eyes to heaven, and look down to the earth
beneath: for the heavens shall vanish like smoke, and the earth
shall be worn away like a garment, and the inhabitants thereof

<li><span>Hearken to me, you that know what is just, my people who

not afraid of their blasphemies.</span></li>

my justice from generation to generation,</span></li>
<li><span>Arise, arise, put on strength, O thou arm of the Lord,
arise as in the days of old, in the ancient generations. Hast not
thou struck the proud one, and wounded the dragon?</span></li>

deep, who madest the depth of the sea a way, that the delivered
might pass over?</span></li>
<li><span>And now they that are redeemed by the Lord, shall return,
and shall come into Sion singing praises, and joy everlasting shall
be upon their heads, they shall obtain joy and gladness, sorrow and
mourning shall flee away.</span></li>
<li><span>I, I myself will comfort you: who art thou, that thou
shouldst be afraid of a mortal man, and of the son of man, who
shall wither away like grass?</span></li>
<li><span>And thou hast forgotten the Lord thy maker, who stretched
out the heavens, and founded the earth: and thee hast been afraid
continually all the day at the presence of his fury who afflicted
thee, and had prepared himself to destroy thee: where is now the
fury of the oppressor?</span></li>
<li><span>He shall quickly come that is going to open unto you, and
he shall not kill unto utter destruction, neither shall his bread
fail.</span></li>
<li><span>But I am the Lord thy God, who trouble the sea, and the
waves thereof swell: the Lord of hosts is my name.</span></li>
<li><span>I have put my words in thy mouth, and have protected thee
in the shadow of my hand, that thou mightest plant the heavens, and
found the earth: and mightest say to Sion: Thou art my
people.</span></li>
<li><span>Arise, arise, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at
the hand of the Lord the cup of his wrath; thou hast drunk even to
the bottom of the cup of dead sleep, and thou hast drunk even to
the dregs.</span></li>
<li><span>There is none that can uphold her among all the children
that she hath brought forth: and there is none that taketh her by
the hand among all the children that she hath brought
up.</span></li>
<li><span>There are two things that have happened to thee: who
shall be sorry for thee? desolation, and destruction, and the
famine, and the sword, who shall comfort thee?</span></li>
<li><span>Thy children are cast forth, they have slept at the head
of all the ways, as the wild ox that is snared: full of the
indignation of the Lord, of the rebuke of thy God.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore hear this, thou poor little one, and thou that
art drunk but no with wine.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith thy Sovereign the Lord and thy God, who will
fight for his people: Behold I have taken out of thy hand the cup
of dead sleep, the dregs of the cup of my indignation, thou shalt
not drink it again any more.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will put it in the hand of them that have oppressed
thee, and have said to thy soul: Bow down, that we may go over: and
thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as a way to them that

that we should be desirous of him:</span></li>
<li><span>Despised, and the most abject of men, a man of sorrows,

<li><span>Surely he hath borne our infirmities and carried our
sorrows: and we have thought him as it were a leper, and as one
struck by God and afflicted.</span></li>
<li><span>But he was wounded for our iniquities, he was bruised for
our sins: the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and by his
bruises we are healed.</span></li>
<li><span>All we like sheep have gone astray, every one hath turned
aside into his own way: and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity

<li><span>He was offered because it was his own will, and he opened
not his mouth: he shall be led as a sheep to the slaughter, and
shall be dumb as a lamb before his shearer, and he shall not open
his mouth.</span></li>
<li><span>He was taken away from distress, and from judgment: who
shall declare his generation? because he is cut oh out of the land

him.</span></li>

rich for his death: because he hath done no iniquity, neither was
there deceit in his mouth.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>All you that thirst, come to the waters: and you that
have no money make haste, buy, and eat: come ye, buy wine and milk
without money, and without any price.</span></li>
<li><span>Why do you spend money for that which is not breed, and
your labour for that which doth not satisfy you? Hearken diligently
to me, and eat that which is good, and your soul shall be delighted
in fatness.</span></li>
<li><span>Incline your ear and come to me: hear and your soul shall
lire, and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, the
faithful mercies of David.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I have given him for a witness to the people, for
a leader and a master to the Gentiles.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold thou shalt call a nation, which thou knewest not:
and the nations that knew not thee shall run to thee, because of
the Lord thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel, for he hath
glorified thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Seek ye the Lord, while he may be found: call upon him,
while he is near.</span></li>
<li><span>Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unjust man his
thoughts, and let him return to the Lord, and he will have mercy on
him, and to our God: for he is bountiful to forgive.</span></li>
<li><span>For my thoughts are not your thoughts: nor your ways my
ways, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>For as the heavens are exalted above the earth, so are my
ways exalted above your ways, and my thoughts above your
thoughts.</span></li>
<li><span>And as the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and
return no more thither, but soak the earth, and water it, and make
it to spring, and give seed to the sower, and bread to the
eater:</span></li>
<li><span>So shall my word be, which shall go forth from my mouth:
it shall not return to me void, but it shall do whatsoever I
please, and shall prosper in the things for which I sent
it.</span></li>
<li><span>For you shall go out with joy, and be led forth with
peace: the mountains and the hills shall sing praise before yen,
and all the trees of the country shah clap their hands.</span></li>
<li><span>Instead of the shrub, shall come up the fir tree, and
instead of the nettle, shall come up the myrtle tree: and the Lord
shall be named for an everlasting sign, that shall not be taken
away.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord : Keep ye judgment, and do justice:
for my salvation is near to come, and my justice to be
revealed.</span></li>
<li><span>Blessed is the man that doth this, and the son of man
that shall lay hold on this: that keepeth the sabbath from
profaning it, that keepeth his hands from doing any
evil.</span></li>
<li><span>And let not the son of the stranger, that adhereth to the
Lord, speak, saying: The Lord will divide and separate me from his
people. And let not the eunuch say: Behold I am a dry
tree.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord to the eunuchs, They that shall
keep my sabbaths, and shall choose the things that please me, and
shall hold fast my covenant:</span></li>
<li><span>I will give to them in my house, and within my walls, a
place, and a name better than sons and daughters: I will give them
an everlasting name which shall never perish.</span></li>
<li><span>And the children of the stranger that adhere to the Lord,
to worship him, and to love his name, to be his servants: every one
that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it, and that holdeth fast
my covenant:</span></li>
<li><span>I will bring them into my holy mount, and will make them
joyful in my house of prayer: their holocausts, and their victims
shall please me upon my altar: for my house shall be called the
house of prayer, for all nations.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord God, who gathereth the scattered of Israel,
saith: I will still gather unto him his congregation.</span></li>
<li><span>All ye beasts of the field come to devour, all ye beasts
of the forest.</span></li>
<li><span>His watchmen are all blind, they are all ignorant: dumb
dogs not able to bark, seeing vain things, sleeping and loving
dreams.</span></li>
<li><span>And meet impudent dogs, they never had enough: the
shepherds themselves knew no understanding: all have turned aside
into their own way, every one after his own gain, from the first
even to the last.</span></li>

and it shall be as to day, so also to morrow, and much

<ol>
<li><span>The just perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart, and
men of mercy are taken away, because there is none that
understandeth; for the just man is taken away from before the face
of evil.</span></li>
<li><span>Let peace come, let him rest in his bed that hath walked
in his uprightness.</span></li>
<li><span>But draw near hither, you sons of the sorceress, the seed
of the adulterer, and of the harlot.</span></li>
<li><span>Upon whom have you jested? upon whom have you opened your
mouth wide, and put out your tongue? are not you wicked children, a
false seed,</span></li>
<li><span>Who seek your comfort in idols under every green tree,
sacrificing children in the torrents, under the high
rocks?</span></li>
<li><span>In the parts of the torrent is thy portion, this is thy
lot: and thou hast poured out libations to them, thou hast offered
sacrifice. Shall I not be angry at these things?</span></li>
<li><span>Upon a high and lofty mountain thou hast laid thy bed,
and hast gone up thither to offer victims.</span></li>
<li><span>And behind the door, and behind the post thou best set up
thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered thyself near me, and hast
received an adulterer: thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made a
covenant with them: thou hast loved their bed with open
hand.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou hast adorned thyself for the king with ointment,
and hast multiplied thy perfumes. Thou hast sent thy messengers far
off, and wast debased even to hell.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast been wearied in the multitude of thy ways: yet
thou saidst not: I will rest: thou hast found life of thy hand,
therefore thou hast not asked.</span></li>
<li><span>For whom hast thou been solicitous and afraid, that thou
hast lied, and hast not been mindful of me, nor thought on me in
thy heart? for I am silent, and as one that seeth not, and thou
hast forgotten me.</span></li>
<li><span>I will declare thy justice, and thy works shall not
profit thee.</span></li>
<li><span>When thou shalt cry, let thy companies deliver thee, but
the wind shall carry them all off, a breeze shall take them away,
but he that putteth his trust in me, shall inherit the land, and
shall possess my holy mount.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will say: Make a way: give free passage, turn out
of the path, take away the stumblingblocks out of the way of my
people.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the High and the Eminent that inhabiteth
eternity: and his name is Holy, who dwelleth in the high and holy
place, and with a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit
of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite.</span></li>
<li><span>For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be angry
unto the end: because the spirit shall go forth from my face, end
breathings I will make.</span></li>
<li><span>For the iniquity of his covetousness I was angry, and I
struck him: I hid my face from thee, and was angry: and he went
away wandering in his own heart.</span></li>
<li><span>I saw his ways, and I healed him, and brought him back,
and restored comforts to him, and to them that mourn for
him.</span></li>
<li><span>I created the fruit of the lips, peace, peace to him that
is far off, and to him that is near, said the Lord, and I healed
him.</span></li>

<li><span>Cry, cease not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and
shew my people their wicked doings, and the house of Jacob their
sins.</span></li>
<li><span>For they seek me from day to day, sad desire to know my
ways, as a nation that hath done justice, and hath not forsaken the
judgment of their God: they ask of me the judgments of justice:
they are willing to approach to God.</span></li>
<li><span>Why have we fasted, and thou hast not regarded: have we
humbled our souls, and thou hast not taken notice? Behold in the
day of your fast your own will is found, and you exact of all your
debtors.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold you fast for debates and strife. and strike with
the fist wickedly. Do not fast as you have done until this day, to
make your cry to be heard on high.</span></li>
<li><span>Is this such a fast as I have chosen: for a man to
afflict his soul for a day? is this it, to wind his head about like
a circle, and to spread sackcloth and ashes? wilt thou call this a
fast, and a day acceptable to the Lord?</span></li>
<li><span>Is not this rather the fast that I have chosen? loose the
bands of wickedness, undo the bundles that oppress, let them that
are broken go free, and break asunder every burden.</span></li>
<li><span>Deal thy bread to the hungry, and bring the needy and the
harbourless into thy house: when thou shalt see one naked, cover
him, and despise not thy own flesh.</span></li>
<li><span>Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy
health shall speedily arise, and thy justice shall go before thy
face, end the glory of the Lord shall gather thee up.</span></li>
<li><span>Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall hear: thou shalt
cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou wilt take away the chain
out of the midst of thee, and cease to stretch out the finger, and
to speak that which profiteth not.</span></li>
<li><span>When thou shalt pour out thy soul to the hungry, and
shalt satisfy the afflicted soul then shall thy light rise up in
darkness, and thy darkness shall be as the noonday.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord will give thee rest continually, and will
fill thy soul with brightness, and deliver thy bones, and thou
shalt be like a watered garden, and like a fountain of water whose
waters shall not fail</span></li>
<li><span>And the places that have been desolate for ages shall be
built in thee: thou shalt raise up the foundations of generation
and generation: and thou shalt be called the repairer of the
fences, turning the paths into rest.</span></li>
<li><span>If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing
thy own will in my holy day, and call the sabbath delightful, and
the holy of the Lord glorious, and glorify him, while thou dost not
thy own ways, and thy own will is not found: to speak a
word:</span></li>
<li><span>Then shalt thou be delighted in the Lord, and I will lift
thee up above the high places of the earth, and will feed thee with
the inheritance of Jacob thy father. For the mouth of the Lord hath
spoken it.</span></li>

<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="59">Isaiah 59</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Behold the hand of the Lord is not shortened that it
cannot save, neither is his ear heavy that it cannot
hear.</span></li>
<li><span>But your iniquities have divided between you and your
God, and your sins have hid his face from you that he should not
hear.</span></li>
<li><span>For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers
with iniquity: your lips have spoken lies, and your tongue uttereth
iniquity.</span></li>
<li><span>There is none that calleth upon justice, neither is there
any one that judgeth truly: but they trust in a mere nothing, and
speak vanities: they have conceived labour, and brought forth
iniquity.</span></li>
<li><span>They have broken the eggs of asps, and have woven the
webs of spiders: he that shall eat of their eggs, shall die: and
that which is brought out, shall be hatched into a
basilisk.</span></li>
<li><span>Their webs shall not be for clothing, neither shall they
cover themselves with their works: their works are unprofitable
works, and the work of iniquity is in their hands.</span></li>
<li><span>Their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed innocent
blood: their thoughts are unprofitable thoughts: wasting and
destruction are in their ways.</span></li>
<li><span>They have not known the way of peace, and there is no
judgment in their steps: their paths are become crooked to them,
every one that treadeth in them, knoweth no peace.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore is judgment far from us, and justice shall not
overtake us. We looked for light, and behold darkness: brightness,
and we have walked in the dark.</span></li>
<li><span>We have groped for the wall, and like the blind we have
groped as if we had no eyes: we have stumbled at noonday as in
darkness, we are in dark places as dead men.</span></li>
<li><span>We shall roar all of us like bears, and shall lament as
mournful doves. We have looked for judgment, and there is none: for
salvation, and it is far from us.</span></li>
<li><span>For our iniquities are multiplied before thee, and our
sins have testified against us: for our wicked doings are with us,
and we have known our iniquities:</span></li>
<li><span>In sinning and lying against the Lord: and we have turned
away so that we went not after our God, but spoke calumny and
transgression : we have conceived, and uttered from the heart,
words of falsehood.</span></li>
<li><span>And judgment is turned away backward, and justice hath
stood far off: because truth bath fallen down in the street, and
equity could not come in.</span></li>
<li><span>And truth hath been forgotten: and he that departed from
evil, lay open to be a prey: and the Lord saw, and it appeared evil
in his eyes, because there is no judgment.</span></li>
<li><span>And he saw that there is not a man: and he stood
astonished, because there is none to oppose himself: and his own
arm brought salvation to him, and his own justice supported
him.</span></li>
<li><span>He put on justice as a breastplate, and a helmet of
salvation upon his head: he put on the garments of vengeance, and
was clad with zeal as with a cloak.</span></li>
<li><span>As unto revenge, as it were to repay wrath to his
adversaries, and a reward to his enemies: he will repay the like to
the islands.</span></li>
<li><span>And they from the west, shall fear the name of the Lord:
and they from the rising of the sun, his glory: when he shall come
as a violent stream, which the spirit of the Lord driveth
on:</span></li>
<li><span>And there shall come a, redeemer to Sion, and to them
that return from iniquity in Jacob, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>This is my covenant with them, saith the Lord: My spirit
that is in thee, and my words that I have put in thy mouth, shall
not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor
out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the Lord, from
henceforth and for ever.</span></li>

that passed through thee, I will make thee to be an everlasting
glory, a joy unto generation and generation:</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt suck the milk of the Gentiles, and thou
shalt be nursed with the breasts of kings: and thou shalt know that
I am the Lord thy Saviour, and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of
Jacob.</span></li>
<li><span>For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring
silver: and for wood brass, and for stones iron: and I will make
thy visitation peace, and thy overseers justice.</span></li>

destruction in thy borders, and salvation shall possess thy walls,
and praise thy gates.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt no more have the sun for thy light by day,
neither shall the brightness of the moon enlighten thee: but the
Lord shall be unto thee for an everlasting light, and thy God for
thy glory.</span></li>
<li><span>Thy sun shall go down no more, and thy moon shall not
decrease: for the Lord shall be unto thee for an everlasting light,

thee, what things thou hast prepared for them that wait for
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast met him that rejoiceth, and doth justice: in
thy ways they shall remember thee: behold thou art angry, and we
have sinned: in them we have been always, and we shall be
saved.</span></li>
<li><span>And we are all become as one unclean, and all our
justices as the rag of a menstruous woman: and we have all fallen
as a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us
away.</span></li>
<li><span>There is none that calleth upon thy name: that riseth up,
and taketh hold of thee: thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast
crushed us in the hand of our iniquity.</span></li>
<li><span>And now, O Lord, thou art our father, and we are clay:
and thou art our maker, and we all are the works of thy
hands.</span></li>
<li><span>Be not very angry, O Lord, and remember no longer our
iniquity: behold, see we are all thy people.</span></li>
<li><span>The city of thy sanctuary is become a desert, Sion is
made a desert, Jerusalem is desolate.</span></li>
<li><span>The house of our holiness, and of our glory, where our
fathers praised thee, is burnt with fire, and all our lovely things
are turned into ruins.</span></li>
<li><span>Wilt thou refrain thyself, O Lord, upon these things,
wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us vehemently?</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="65">Isaiah 65</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>They have sought me that before asked not for me, they
have found me that sought me not. I said: Behold me, behold me, to
a nation that did not call upon my name.</span></li>
<li><span>I have spread forth my hands all the day to an
unbelieving people, who walk in a way that is not good after their
own thoughts.</span></li>
<li><span>A people that continually provoke me to anger before my
face: that immolate in gardens, and sacrifice upon
bricks.</span></li>
<li><span>That dwell in sepulchres, and sleep in the temple of
idols: that eat swine's flesh, and profane broth is in their
vessels.</span></li>
<li><span>That say: Depart from me, come not near me, because thou
art unclean: these shall be smoke in my anger, a fire burning all
the day.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold it is written before me: I will not be silent, but
I will render and repay into their bosom.</span></li>
<li><span>Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers
together, saith the Lord, who have sacrificed upon the mountains,
and have reproached me upon the hills; and I will measure back
their first work in their bosom.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: As if a grain be found in a cluster,
and it be said: Destroy it not, because it is a blessing: so will I
do for the sake of my servants, that I may not destroy the
whole.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of
Juda a possessor of my mountains: and my elect shall inherit it,
and my servants shall dwell there.</span></li>
<li><span>And the plains shall be turned to folds of hocks, and the
valley of Achor into a place for the herds to lie down in, for my
people that have sought me.</span></li>
<li><span>And you, that have forsaken the Lord, that have forgotten
my holy mount, that set a table for fortune, and offer libations
upon it,</span></li>
<li><span>I will number you in the sword, and you shall all fall by
slaughter: because I called and you did not answer: I spoke, and
you did not hear: and you did evil in my eyes, and you have chosen
the things that displease me.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Behold my servants
shall eat, and you shall be hungry: behold my servants shall drink,
and you shall be thirsty.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold my servants shall rejoice, and you shall be
confounded: behold my servants shall praise for joyfulness of
heart, and you shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for
grief of spirit.</span></li>
<li><span>And you shall leave your name for an execration to my
elect: and the Lord God shall slay thee, and call his servants by
another name.</span></li>
<li><span>In which he that is blessed upon the earth, shall be
blessed in God, amen: and he that sweareth in the earth, shall
swear by God, amen: because the former distresses are forgotten,
and because they are hid from my eyes.</span></li>
<li><span>For behold I create new heavens, and a new earth: and the
former things shall not be in remembrance, and they shell not come
upon the heart.</span></li>
<li><span>But you shall be glad and rejoice for ever in these
things, which I create: for behold I create Jerusalem a rejoicing,
end the people thereof joy.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people,
and the voice of weeping shall no more be heard in her, nor the
voice of crying.</span></li>
<li><span>There shall no more be an infant of days there, nor an
old man that shall not fill up his days: for the child shall die a
hundred years old, and the sinner being a hundred years old shall
be accursed.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they
shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruits of them.</span></li>
<li><span>They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not
plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree, so shall be the
days of my people, and the works of their hands shall be of long
continuance.</span></li>
<li><span>My elect shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth in
trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the Lord, and
their posterity with them.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will
hear; as they are yet speaking, I will hear.</span></li>
<li><span>The wolf and the lamb shall feed together; the lion and
the ox shall eat straw; and dust shall be the serpent's food: they
shall not hurt nor kill in all my holy mountain, saith the
Lord.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="66">Isaiah 66</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord: Heaven is my throne, and the earth
my footstool: what is this house that you will build to me? and
what is this place of my rest?</span></li>
<li><span>My hand made all these things, and all these things were
made, saith the Lord. But to whom shall I have respect, but to him
that is poor and little, and of a contrite spirit, and that
trembleth at my words?</span></li>
<li><span>He that sacrificeth an ox, is as if he slew a man: he
that killeth a sheep in sacrifice, as if he should brain a dog: he
that offereth an oblation, as if he should offer swine's blood; he
that remembereth incense, as if he should bless an idol. All these
things have they chosen in their ways, and their soul is delighted
in their abominations.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore I also will choose their mockeries, and will
bring upon them the things they feared: y because I called, and
there was none that would answer; I have spoken, and they heard
not; and they have done evil in my eyes, and have chosen the things
that displease me.</span></li>
<li><span>Hear the word of the Lord, you that tremble at his word:
Your brethren that hate you, and cast you out for my name's sake,
have said: Let the Lord be glorified, and we shall see in your joy:
but they shall be confounded.</span></li>
<li><span>A voice of the people from the city, a voice from the
temple, the voice of the Lord that rendereth recompense to his
enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>Before she was in labour, she brought forth; before her
time came to be delivered, she brought forth a man
child.</span></li>
<li><span>Who hath ever heard such a thing? and who hath seen the
like to this? shall the earth bring forth in one day? or shall a
nation be brought forth at once, because Sion hath been in labour,
and hath brought forth her children?</span></li>
<li><span>Shall not I that make others to bring forth children,
myself bring forth, saith the Lord? shall I, that give generation
to others, be barren, saith the Lord thy God?</span></li>
<li><span>Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all you
that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all you that mourn for
her.</span></li>
<li><span>That you may suck, and be filled with the breasts of her
consolations: that you may milk out, and flow with delights, from
the abundance of her glory.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord: Behold I will bring upon her as
it were a river of peace, and as an overflowing torrent the glory
of the Gentiles, which you shall suck; you shall be carried at the
breasts, end upon the knees they shall caress you.</span></li>
<li><span>As one whom the mother caresseth, so will I comfort you,
and you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>You shah see and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones
shall flourish like an herb, and the hand of the Lord shall be
known to his servants, and he shall be angry with his
enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>For behold the Lord will come with fire, and his chariots
are like a whirlwind, to render his wrath in indignation, and his
rebuke with flames of fire.</span></li>
<li><span>For the Lord shall judge by fire, and by his sword unto
all flesh, and the slain of the Lord shall be many.</span></li>
<li><span>They that were sanctified, and thought themselves clean
in the gardens behind the gate within, they that did eat swine's
flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse: they shall be consumed
together, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>But I know their works, and their thoughts: I come that I
may gather them together with all nations and tongues: and they
shall come and shall see my glory.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will set a sign among them, and I will send of them
that shall be saved, to the Gentiles into the sea, into Africa, and
Lydia them that draw the bow: into Italy, and Greece, to the
islands afar off, to them that have not heard of me, and have not
seen my glory. And they shall declare my glory to the
Gentiles:</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall bring all your brethren out of all nations
for a gift to the Lord, upon horses, and in chariots, and in
litters, and on mules, and in coaches, to my holy mountain
Jerusalem, saith the Lord, as if the children of Israel should
bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will take of them to be priests, and Levites, saith
the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>For as the new heavens, and the new earth, which I will
make to stand before me, saith the Lord: so shall your seed stand,
and your name.</span></li>
<li><span>And there shall be month after month, and sabbath after
sabbath: and all flesh shall come to adore before my face, saith
the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall go out, and see the carcasses of the men
that have transgressed against me: their worm shah not die, and
their fire shall not be quenched: and they shall be a loathsome
sight to all flesh.</span></li>
