<ol>
<li><span>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle,
separated unto the gospel of God,</span></li>
<li><span>Which he had promised before, by his prophets, in the
holy scriptures,</span></li>
<li><span>Concerning his Son, who was made to him of the seed of
David, according to the flesh,</span></li>
<li><span>Who was predestinated the Son of God in power, according
to the spirit of sanctification, by the resurrection of our Lord
Jesus Christ from the dead;</span></li>
<li><span>By whom we have received grace and apostleship for
obedience to the faith, in all nations, for his name;</span></li>
<li><span>Among whom are you also the called of Jesus
Christ:</span></li>
<li><span>To all that are at Rome, the beloved of God, called to be
saints. Grace to you, and peace from God our Father, and from the
Lord Jesus Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>First I give thanks to my God, through Jesus Christ, for
you all, because your faith is spoken of in the whole
world.</span></li>
<li><span>For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the
gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make a commemoration of
you;</span></li>
<li><span>Always in my prayers making request, if by any means now
at length I may have a prosperous journey, by the will of God, to
come unto you.</span></li>
<li><span>For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some
spiritual grace, to strengthen you:</span></li>
<li><span>That is to say, that I may be comforted together in you,
by that which is common to us both, your faith and
mine.</span></li>
<li><span>And I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that I have
often purposed to come unto you, (and have been hindered hitherto,)
that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other
Gentiles.</span></li>
<li><span>To the Greeks and to the barbarians, to the wise and to
the unwise, I am a debtor;</span></li>
<li><span>So (as much as is in me) I am ready to preach the gospel
to you also that are at Rome.</span></li>
<li><span>For I am not ashamed of the gospel. For it is the power
of God unto salvation to every one that believeth, to the Jew
first, and to the Greek.</span></li>
<li><span>For the justice of God is revealed therein, from faith
unto faith, as it is written: The just man liveth by
faith.</span></li>
<li><span>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness and injustice of those men that detain the truth of God
in injustice:</span></li>
<li><span>Because that which is known of God is manifest in them.
For God hath manifested it unto them.</span></li>
<li><span>For the invisible things of him, from the creation of the
world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are
made; his eternal power also, and divinity: so that they are
inexcusable.</span></li>
<li><span>Because that, when they knew God, they have not glorified
him as God, or given thanks; but became vain in their thoughts, and
their foolish heart was darkened.</span></li>
<li><span>For professing themselves to be wise, they became
fools.</span></li>
<li><span>And they changed the glory of the incorruptible God into
the likeness of the image of a corruptible man, and of birds, and
of fourfooted beasts, and of creeping things.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore God gave them up to the desires of their heart,
unto uncleanness, to dishonour their own bodies among
themselves.</span></li>
<li><span>Who changed the truth of God into a lie; and worshipped
and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for
ever. Amen.</span></li>
<li><span>For this cause God delivered them up to shameful
affections. For their women have changed the natural use into that
use which is against nature.</span></li>
<li><span>And, in like manner, the men also, leaving the natural
use of the women, have burned in their lusts one towards another,
men with men working that which is filthy, and receiving in
themselves the recompense which was due to their error.</span></li>
<li><span>And as they liked not to have God in their knowledge, God
delivered them up to a reprobate sense, to do those things which
are not convenient;</span></li>
<li><span>Being filled with all iniquity, malice, fornication,
avarice, wickedness, full of envy, murder, contention, deceit,
malignity, whisperers,</span></li>
<li><span>Detractors, hateful to God, contumelious, proud, haughty,
inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</span></li>
<li><span>Foolish, dissolute, without affection, without fidelity,
without mercy.</span></li>
<li><span>Who, having known the justice of God, did not understand
that they who do such things, are worthy of death; and not only
they that do them, but they also that consent to them that do
them.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="2">Romans 2</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Wherefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art
that judgest. For wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest
thyself. For thou dost the same things which thou
judgest.</span></li>
<li><span>For we know that the judgment of God is, according to
truth, against them that do such things.</span></li>
<li><span>And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them who do
such things, and dost the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment
of God?</span></li>
<li><span>Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and
patience, and longsuffering? Knowest thou not, that the benignity
of God leadeth thee to penance?</span></li>
<li><span>But according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, thou
treasurest up to thyself wrath, against the day of wrath, and
revelation of the just judgment of God.</span></li>
<li><span>Who will render to every man according to his
works.</span></li>
<li><span>To them indeed, who according to patience in good work,
seek glory and honour and incorruption, eternal life:</span></li>
<li><span>But to them that are contentious, and who obey not the
truth, but give credit to iniquity, wrath and
indignation.</span></li>
<li><span>Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that
worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek.</span></li>
<li><span>But glory, and honour, and peace to every one that
worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</span></li>
<li><span>For there is no respect of persons with God.</span></li>
<li><span>For whosoever have sinned without the law, shall perish
without the law; and whosoever have sinned in the law, shall be
judged by the law.</span></li>
<li><span>For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but
the doers of the law shall be justified.</span></li>
<li><span>For when the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature
those things that are of the law; these having not the law are a
law to themselves:</span></li>
<li><span>Who shew the work of the law written in their hearts,
their conscience bearing witness to them, and their thoughts
between themselves accusing, or also defending one
another,</span></li>
<li><span>In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by
Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.</span></li>
<li><span>But if thou art called a Jew and restest in the law, and
makest thy boast of God,</span></li>
<li><span>And knowest his will, and approvest the more profitable
things, being instructed by the law,</span></li>
<li><span>Art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind,
a light of them that are in darkness,</span></li>
<li><span>An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants,
having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou therefore that teachest another, teachest not
thyself: thou that preachest that men should not steal,
stealest:</span></li>
<li><span>Thou that sayest, men should not commit adultery,
committest adultery: thou that abhorrest idols, committest
sacrilege:</span></li>
<li><span>Thou that makest thy boast of the law, by transgression
of the law dishonourest God.</span></li>
<li><span>(For the name of God through you is blasphemed among the
Gentiles, as it is written.)</span></li>
<li><span>Circumcision profiteth indeed, if thou keep the law; but
if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is made
uncircumcision.</span></li>
<li><span>If, then, the uncircumcised keep the justices of the law,
shall not this uncircumcision be counted for
circumcision?</span></li>
<li><span>And shall not that which by nature is uncircumcision, if
it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision
art a transgressor of the law?</span></li>
<li><span>For it is not he is a Jew, who is so outwardly; nor is
that circumcision which is outwardly in the flesh:</span></li>
<li><span>But he is a Jew, that is one inwardly; and the
circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the
letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="3">Romans 3</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>What advantage then hath the Jew, or what is the profit
of circumcision?</span></li>
<li><span>Much every way. First indeed, because the words of God
were committed to them.</span></li>
<li><span>For what if some of them have not believed? shall their
unbelief make the faith of God without effect? God
forbid.</span></li>
<li><span>But God is true; and every man a liar, as it is written,
That thou mayest be justified in thy words, and mayest overcome
when thou art judged.</span></li>
<li><span>But if our injustice commend the justice of God, what
shall we say? Is God unjust, who executeth wrath?</span></li>
<li><span>(I speak according to man.) God forbid: otherwise how
shall God judge this world?</span></li>
<li><span>For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my
lie, unto his glory, why am I also yet judged as a
sinner?</span></li>
<li><span>And not rather (as we are slandered, and as some affirm
that we say) let us do evil, that there may come good? whose
damnation is just.</span></li>
<li><span>What then? Do we excel them? No, not so. For we have
charged both Jews, and Greeks, that they are all under
sin.</span></li>
<li><span>As it is written: There is not any man just.</span></li>
<li><span>There is none that understandeth, there is none that
seeketh after God.</span></li>
<li><span>All have turned out of the way; they are become
unprofitable together: there is none that doth good, there is not
so much as one.</span></li>
<li><span>Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues
they have dealt deceitfully. The venom of asps is under their
lips.</span></li>
<li><span>Whose mouth is full of cursing and
bitterness:</span></li>
<li><span>Their feet swift to shed blood:</span></li>
<li><span>Destruction and misery in their ways:</span></li>
<li><span>And the way of peace they have not known:</span></li>
<li><span>There is no fear of God before their eyes.</span></li>
<li><span>Now we know, that what things soever the law speaketh, it
speaketh to them that are in the law; that every mouth may be
stopped, and all the world may be made subject to God.</span></li>
<li><span>Because by the works of the law no flesh shall be
justified before him. For by the law is the knowledge of
sin.</span></li>
<li><span>But now without the law the justice of God is made
manifest, being witnessed by the law and the prophets.</span></li>
<li><span>Even the justice of God, by faith of Jesus Christ, unto
all and upon all them that believe in him: for there is no
distinction:</span></li>
<li><span>For all have sinned, and do need the glory of
God.</span></li>
<li><span>Being justified freely by his grace, through the
redemption, that is in Christ Jesus,</span></li>
<li><span>Whom God hath proposed to be a propitiation, through
faith in his blood, to the shewing of his justice, for the
remission of former sins,</span></li>
<li><span>Through the forbearance of God, for the shewing of his
justice in this time; that he himself may be just, and the
justifier of him, who is of the faith of Jesus Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>Where is then thy boasting? It is excluded. By what law?
Of works? No, but by the law of faith.</span></li>
<li><span>For we account a man to be justified by faith, without
the works of the law.</span></li>
<li><span>Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the
Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also.</span></li>
<li><span>For it is one God, that justifieth circumcision by faith,
and uncircumcision through faith.</span></li>
<li><span>Do we, then, destroy the law through faith? God forbid:
but we establish the law.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="4">Romans 4</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>What shall we say then that Abraham hath found, who is
our father according to the flesh.</span></li>
<li><span>For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof
to glory, but not before God.</span></li>
<li><span>For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and
it was reputed to him unto justice.</span></li>
<li><span>Now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned
according to grace, but according to debt.</span></li>
<li><span>But to him that worketh not, yet believeth in him that
justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reputed to justice, according
to the purpose of the grace of God.</span></li>
<li><span>As David also termeth the blessedness of a man, to whom
God reputeth justice without works:</span></li>
<li><span>Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose
sins are covered.</span></li>
<li><span>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed
sin.</span></li>
<li><span>This blessedness then, doth it remain in the circumcision
only, or in the uncircumcision also? For we say that unto Abraham
faith was reputed to justice.</span></li>
<li><span>How then was it reputed? When he was in circumcision, or
in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in
uncircumcision.</span></li>
<li><span>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the
justice of the faith, which he had, being uncircumcised; that he
might be the father of all them that believe, being uncircumcised,
that unto them also it may be reputed to justice:</span></li>
<li><span>And might be the father of circumcision; not to them
only, that are of the circumcision, but to them also that follow
the steps of the faithful, that is in the uncircumcision of our
father Abraham.</span></li>
<li><span>For not through the law was the promise to Abraham, or to
his seed, that he should be heir of the world; but through the
justice of faith.</span></li>
<li><span>For if they who are of the law be heirs, faith is made
void, the promise is made of no effect.</span></li>
<li><span>For the law worketh wrath. For where there is no law,
neither is there transgression.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore is it of faith, that according to grace the
promise might be firm to all the seed; not to that only which is of
the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is
the father of us all,</span></li>
<li><span>(As it is written: I have made thee a father of many
nations,) before God, whom he believed, who quickeneth the dead;
and calleth those things that are not, as those that
are.</span></li>
<li><span>Who against hope believed in hope; that he might be made
the father of many nations, according to that which was said to
him: So shall thy seed be.</span></li>
<li><span>And he was not weak in faith; neither did he consider his
own body now dead, whereas he was almost an hundred years old, nor
the dead womb of Sara.</span></li>
<li><span>In the promise also of God he staggered not by distrust;
but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God:</span></li>
<li><span>Most fully knowing, that whatsoever he has promised, he
is able also to perform.</span></li>
<li><span>And therefore it was reputed to him unto
justice.</span></li>
<li><span>Now it is not written only for him, that it was reputed
to him unto justice,</span></li>
<li><span>But also for us, to whom it shall be reputed, if we
believe in him, that raised up Jesus Christ, our Lord, from the
dead,</span></li>
<li><span>Who was delivered up for our sins, and rose again for our
justification.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="5">Romans 5</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Being justified therefore by faith, let us have peace
with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ:</span></li>
<li><span>By whom also we have access through faith into this
grace, wherein we stand, and glory in the hope of the glory of the
sons of God.</span></li>
<li><span>And not only so; but we glory also in tribulations,
knowing that tribulation worketh patience;</span></li>
<li><span>And patience trial; and trial hope;</span></li>
<li><span>And hope confoundeth not: because the charity of God is
poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost, who is given to
us.</span></li>
<li><span>For why did Christ, when as yet we were weak, according
to the time, die for the ungodly?</span></li>
<li><span>For scarce for a just man will one die; yet perhaps for a
good man some one would dare to die.</span></li>
<li><span>But God commendeth his charity towards us; because when
as yet we were sinners, according to the time,</span></li>
<li><span>Christ died for us; much more therefore, being now
justified by his blood, shall we be saved from wrath through
him.</span></li>
<li><span>For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God
by the death of his Son; much more, being reconciled, shall we be
saved by his life.</span></li>
<li><span>And not only so; but also we glory in God, through our
Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received
reconciliation.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore as by one man sin entered into this world, and
by sin death; and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have
sinned.</span></li>
<li><span>For until the law sin was in the world; but sin was not
imputed, when the law was not.</span></li>
<li><span>But death reigned from Adam unto Moses, even over them
also who have not sinned after the similitude of the transgression
of Adam, who is a figure of him who was to come.</span></li>
<li><span>But not as the offence, so also the gift. For if by the
offence of one, many died; much more the grace of God, and the
gift, by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto
many.</span></li>
<li><span>And not as it was by one sin, so also is the gift. For
judgment indeed was by one unto condemnation; but grace is of many
offences, unto justification.</span></li>
<li><span>For if by one man's offence death reigned through one;
much more they who receive abundance of grace, and of the gift, and
of justice, shall reign in life through one, Jesus
Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore, as by the offence of one, unto all men to
condemnation; so also by the justice of one, unto all men to
justification of life.</span></li>
<li><span>For as by the disobedience of one man, many were made
sinners; so also by the obedience of one, many shall be made
just.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the law entered in, that sin might abound. And where
sin abounded, grace did more abound.</span></li>
<li><span>That as sin hath reigned to death; so also grace might
reign by justice unto life everlasting, through Jesus Christ our
Lord.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="6">Romans 6</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>What shall we say, then? shall we continue in sin, that
grace may abound?</span></li>
<li><span>God forbid. For we that are dead to sin, how shall we
live any longer therein?</span></li>
<li><span>Know you not that all we, who are baptized in Christ
Jesus, are baptized in his death?</span></li>
<li><span>For we are buried together with him by baptism into
death; that as Christ is risen from the dead by the glory of the
Father, so we also may walk in newness of life.</span></li>
<li><span>For if we have been planted together in the likeness of
his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his
resurrection.</span></li>
<li><span>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him,
that the body of sin may be destroyed, to the end that we may serve
sin no longer.</span></li>
<li><span>For he that is dead is justified from sin.</span></li>
<li><span>Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall
live also together with Christ:</span></li>
<li><span>Knowing that Christ rising again from the dead, dieth now
no more, death shall no more have dominion over him.</span></li>
<li><span>For in that he died to sin, he died once; but in that he
liveth, he liveth unto God:</span></li>
<li><span>So do you also reckon, that you are dead to sin, but
alive unto God, in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Let no sin therefore reign in your mortal body, so as to
obey the lusts thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>Neither yield ye your members as instruments of iniquity
unto sin; but present yourselves to God, as those that are alive
from the dead, and your members as instruments of justice unto
God.</span></li>
<li><span>For sin shall not have dominion over you; for you are not
under the law, but under grace.</span></li>
<li><span>What then? Shall we sin, because we are not under the
law, but under grace? God forbid.</span></li>
<li><span>Know you not, that to whom you yield yourselves servants
to obey, his servants you are whom you obey, whether it be of sin
unto death, or of obedience unto justice.</span></li>
<li><span>But thanks be to God, that you were the servants of sin,
but have obeyed from the heart, unto that form of doctrine, into
which you have been delivered.</span></li>
<li><span>Being then freed from sin, we have been made servants of
justice.</span></li>
<li><span>I speak an human thing, because of the infirmity of your
flesh. For as you have yielded your members to serve uncleanness
and iniquity, unto iniquity; so now yield your members to serve
justice, unto sanctification.</span></li>
<li><span>For when you were the servants of sin, you were free men
to justice.</span></li>
<li><span>What fruit therefore had you then in those things, of
which you are now ashamed? For the end of them is
death.</span></li>
<li><span>But now being made free from sin, and become servants to
God, you have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end life
everlasting.</span></li>
<li><span>For the wages of sin is death. But the grace of God, life
everlasting, in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="7">Romans 7</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Know you not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know
the law,) that the law hath dominion over a man, as long as it
liveth?</span></li>
<li><span>For the woman that hath an husband, whilst her husband
liveth is bound to the law. But if her husband be dead, she is
loosed from the law of her husband.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore, whilst her husband liveth, she shall be called
an adulteress, if she be with another man: but if her husband be
dead, she is delivered from the law of her husband; so that she is
not an adulteress, if she be with another man.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore, my brethren, you also are become dead to the
law, by the body of Christ; that you may belong to another, who is
risen again from the dead, that we may bring forth fruit to
God.</span></li>
<li><span>For when we were in the flesh, the passions of sins,
which were by the law, did work in our members, to bring forth
fruit unto death.</span></li>
<li><span>But now we are loosed from the law of death, wherein we
were detained; so that we should serve in newness of spirit, and
not in the oldness of the letter.</span></li>
<li><span>What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? God forbid. But
I do not know sin, but by the law; for I had not known
concupiscence, if the law did not say: Thou shalt not
covet.</span></li>
<li><span>But sin taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me
all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was
dead.</span></li>
<li><span>And I lived some time without the law. But when the
commandment came, sin revived,</span></li>
<li><span>And I died. And the commandment that was ordained to
life, the same was found to be unto death to me.</span></li>
<li><span>For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, seduced me,
and by it killed me.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment
holy, and just, and good.</span></li>
<li><span>Was that then which is good, made death unto me? God
forbid. But sin, that it may appear sin, by that which is good,
wrought death in me; that sin, by the commandment, might become
sinful above measure.</span></li>
<li><span>For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal,
sold under sin.</span></li>
<li><span>For that which I work, I understand not. For I do not
that good which I will; but the evil which I hate, that I
do.</span></li>
<li><span>If then I do that which I will not, I consent to the law,
that it is good.</span></li>
<li><span>Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that
dwelleth in me.</span></li>
<li><span>For I know that there dwelleth not in me, that is to say,
in my flesh, that which is good. For to will, is present with me;
but to accomplish that which is good, I find not.</span></li>
<li><span>For the good which I will, I do not; but the evil which I
will not, that I do.</span></li>
<li><span>Now if I do that which I will not, it is no more I that
do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</span></li>
<li><span>I find then a law, that when I have a will to do good,
evil is present with me.</span></li>
<li><span>For I am delighted with the law of God, according to the
inward man:</span></li>
<li><span>But I see another law in my members, fighting against the
law of my mind, and captivating me in the law of sin, that is in my
members.</span></li>
<li><span>Unhappy man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body
of this death?</span></li>
<li><span>The grace of God, by Jesus Christ our Lord. Therefore, I
myself, with the mind serve the law of God; but with the flesh, the
law of sin.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="8">Romans 8</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>There is now therefore no condemnation to them that are
in Christ Jesus, who walk not according to the flesh.</span></li>
<li><span>For the law of the spirit of life, in Christ Jesus, hath
delivered me from the law of sin and of death.</span></li>
<li><span>For what the law could not do, in that it was weak
through the flesh; God sending his own Son, in the likeness of
sinful flesh and of sin, hath condemned sin in the
flesh;</span></li>
<li><span>That the justification of the law might be fulfilled in
us, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the
spirit.</span></li>
<li><span>For they that are according to the flesh, mind the things
that are of the flesh; but they that are according to the spirit,
mind the things that are of the spirit.</span></li>
<li><span>For the wisdom of the flesh is death; but the wisdom of
the spirit is life and peace.</span></li>
<li><span>Because the wisdom of the flesh is an enemy to God; for
it is not subject to the law of God, neither can it be.</span></li>
<li><span>And they who are in the flesh, cannot please
God.</span></li>
<li><span>But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if so be
that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the
Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</span></li>
<li><span>And if Christ be in you, the body indeed is dead, because
of sin; but the spirit liveth, because of
justification.</span></li>
<li><span>And if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the
dead, dwell in you; he that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead,
shall quicken also your mortal bodies, because of his Spirit that
dwelleth in you.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to
live according to the flesh.</span></li>
<li><span>For if you live according to the flesh, you shall die:
but if by the Spirit you mortify the deeds of the flesh, you shall
live.</span></li>
<li><span>For whosoever are led by the Spirit of God, they are the
sons of God.</span></li>
<li><span>For you have not received the spirit of bondage again in
fear; but you have received the spirit of adoption of sons, whereby
we cry: Abba (Father).</span></li>
<li><span>For the Spirit himself giveth testimony to our spirit,
that we are the sons of God.</span></li>
<li><span>And if sons, heirs also; heirs indeed of God, and joint
heirs with Christ: yet so, if we suffer with him, that we may be
also glorified with him.</span></li>
<li><span>For I reckon that the sufferings of this time are not
worthy to be compared with the glory to come, that shall be
revealed in us.</span></li>
<li><span>For the expectation of the creature waiteth for the
revelation of the sons of God.</span></li>
<li><span>For the creature was made subject to vanity, not
willingly, but by reason of him that made it subject, in
hope:</span></li>
<li><span>Because the creature also itself shall be delivered from
the servitude of corruption, into the liberty of the glory of the
children of God.</span></li>
<li><span>For we know that every creature groaneth and travaileth
in pain, even till now.</span></li>
<li><span>And not only it, but ourselves also, who have the
firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within
ourselves, waiting for the adoption of the sons of God, the
redemption of our body.</span></li>
<li><span>For we are saved by hope. But hope that is seen, is not
hope. For what a man seeth, why doth he hope for?</span></li>
<li><span>But if we hope for that which we see not, we wait for it
with patience.</span></li>
<li><span>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity. For we
know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit
himself asketh for us with unspeakable groanings.</span></li>
<li><span>And he that searcheth the hearts, knoweth what the Spirit
desireth; because he asketh for the saints according to
God.</span></li>
<li><span>And we know that to them that love God, all things work
together unto good, to such as, according to his purpose, are
called to be saints.</span></li>
<li><span>For whom he foreknew, he also predestinated to be made
conformable to the image of his Son; that he might be the firstborn
amongst many brethren.</span></li>
<li><span>And whom he predestinated, them he also called. And whom
he called, them he also justified. And whom he justified, them he
also glorified.</span></li>
<li><span>What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us,
who is against us?</span></li>
<li><span>He that spared not even his own Son, but delivered him up
for us all, how hath he not also, with him, given us all
things?</span></li>
<li><span>Who shall accuse against the elect of God? God that
justifieth.</span></li>
<li><span>Who is he that shall condemn? Christ Jesus that died, yea
that is risen also again; who is at the right hand of God, who also
maketh intercession for us.</span></li>
<li><span>Who then shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall
tribulation? or distress? or famine? or nakedness? or danger? or
persecution? or the sword?</span></li>
<li><span>(As it is written: For thy sake we are put to death all
the day long. We are accounted as sheep for the
slaughter.)</span></li>
<li><span>But in all these things we overcome, because of him that
hath loved us.</span></li>
<li><span>For I am sure that neither death, nor life, nor angels,
nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to
come, nor might,</span></li>
<li><span>Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be
able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus
our Lord.</span></li>

<li><span>And not only she. But when Rebecca also had conceived at
once, of Isaac our father.</span></li>
<li><span>For when the children were not yet born, nor had done any
good or evil (that the purpose of God, according to election, might
stand,)</span></li>
<li><span>Not of works, but of him that calleth, it was said to
her: The elder shall serve the younger.</span></li>
<li><span>As it is written: Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have
hated.</span></li>
<li><span>What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? God
forbid.</span></li>
<li><span>For he saith to Moses: I will have mercy on whom I will
have mercy; and I will shew mercy to whom I will shew
mercy.</span></li>
<li><span>So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that
runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.</span></li>
<li><span>For the scripture saith to Pharao: To this purpose have I
raised thee, that I may shew my power in thee, and that my name may
be declared throughout all the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore he hath mercy on whom he will; and whom he
will, he hardeneth.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou wilt say therefore to me: Why doth he then find
fault? for who resisteth his will?</span></li>
<li><span>O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the
thing formed say to him that formed it: Why hast thou made me
thus?</span></li>
<li><span>Or hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same
lump, to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto
dishonour?</span></li>
<li><span>What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his
power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath, fitted
for destruction,</span></li>
<li><span>That he might shew the riches of his glory on the vessels
of mercy, which he hath prepared unto glory?</span></li>
<li><span>Even us, whom also he hath called, nor only of the Jews,
but also of the Gentiles.</span></li>
<li><span>As in Osee he saith: I will call that which was not my
people, my people; and her that was not beloved, beloved; and her
that had not obtained mercy, one that hath obtained
mercy.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall be, in the place where it was said unto
them, You are not my people; there they shall be called the sons of
the living God.</span></li>
<li><span>And Isaias crieth out concerning Israel: If the number of
the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall
be saved.</span></li>
<li><span>For he shall finish his word, and cut it short in
justice; because a short word shall the Lord make upon the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And as Isaias foretold: Unless the Lord of Sabaoth had
left us a seed, we had been made as Sodom, and we had been like
unto Gomorrha.</span></li>
<li><span>What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who followed
not after justice, have attained to justice, even the justice that
is of faith.</span></li>
<li><span>But Israel, by following after the law of justice, is not
come unto the law of justice.</span></li>
<li><span>Why so? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it
were of works. For they stumbled at the stumblingstone.</span></li>
<li><span>As it is written: Behold I lay in Sion a stumblingstone
and a rock of scandal; and whosoever believeth in him shall not be
confounded.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="10">Romans 10</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Brethren, the will of my heart, indeed, and my prayer to
God, is for them unto salvation.</span></li>
<li><span>For I bear them witness, that they have a zeal of God,
but not according to knowledge.</span></li>
<li><span>For they, not knowing the justice of God, and seeking to
establish their own, have not submitted themselves to the justice
of God.</span></li>
<li><span>For the end of the law is Christ, unto justice to every
one that believeth.</span></li>
<li><span>For Moses wrote, that the justice which is of the law,
the man that shall do it, shall live by it.</span></li>
<li><span>But the justice which is of faith, speaketh thus: Say not
in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? that is, to bring
Christ down;</span></li>
<li><span>Or who shall descend into the deep? that is, to bring up
Christ again from the dead.</span></li>
<li><span>But what saith the scripture? The word is nigh thee, even
in thy mouth, and in thy heart. This is the word of faith, which we
preach.</span></li>
<li><span>For if thou confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and
believe in thy heart that God hath raised him up from the dead,
thou shalt be saved.</span></li>
<li><span>For, with the heart, we believe unto justice; but, with
the mouth, confession is made unto salvation.</span></li>
<li><span>For the scripture saith: Whosoever believeth in him,
shall not be confounded.</span></li>
<li><span>For there is no distinction of the Jew and the Greek: for
the same is Lord over all, rich unto all that call upon
him.</span></li>
<li><span>For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall
be saved.</span></li>
<li><span>How then shall they call on him, in whom they have not
believed? Or how shall they believe him, of whom they have not
heard? And how shall they hear, without a preacher?</span></li>
<li><span>And how shall they preach unless they be sent, as it is
written: How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel
of peace, of them that bring glad tidings of good
things!</span></li>
<li><span>But all do not obey the gospel. For Isaias saith: Lord,
who hath believed our report?</span></li>
<li><span>Faith then cometh by hearing; and hearing by the word of
Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>But I say: Have they not heard? Yes, verily, their sound
hath gone forth into all the earth, and their words unto the ends
of the whole world.</span></li>
<li><span>But I say: Hath not Israel known? First, Moses saith: I
will provoke you to jealousy by that which is not a nation; by a
foolish nation I will anger you.</span></li>
<li><span>But Isaias is bold, and saith: I was found by them that
did not seek me: I appeared openly to them that asked not after
me.</span></li>
<li><span>But to Israel he saith: All the day long have I spread my
hands to a people that believeth not, and contradicteth
me.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see: and
bow down their back always.</span></li>
<li><span>I say then, have they so stumbled, that they should fall?
God forbid. But by their offence, salvation is come to the
Gentiles, that they may be emulous of them.</span></li>
<li><span>Now if the offence of them be the riches of the world,
and the diminution of them, the riches of the Gentiles; how much
more the fulness of them?</span></li>
<li><span>For I say to you, Gentiles: as long indeed as I am the
apostle of the Gentiles, I will honour my ministry,</span></li>
<li><span>If, by any means, I may provoke to emulation them who are
my flesh, and may save some of them.</span></li>
<li><span>For if the loss of them be the reconciliation of the
world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the
dead?</span></li>
<li><span>For if the firstfruit be holy, so is the lump also: and
if the root be holy, so are the branches.</span></li>
<li><span>And if some of the branches be broken, and thou, being a
wild olive, art ingrafted in them, and art made partaker of the
root, and of the fatness of the olive tree,</span></li>
<li><span>Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou
bearest not the root, but the root thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou wilt say then: The branches were broken off, that I
might be grafted in.</span></li>
<li><span>Well: because of unbelief they were broken off. But thou
standest by faith: be not highminded, but fear.</span></li>
<li><span>For if God hath not spared the natural branches, fear
lest perhaps he also spare not thee.</span></li>
<li><span>See then the goodness and the severity of God: towards
them indeed that are fallen, the severity; but towards thee, the
goodness of God, if thou abide in goodness, otherwise thou also
shalt be cut off.</span></li>
<li><span>And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall
be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.</span></li>
<li><span>For if thou wert cut out of the wild olive tree, which is
natural to thee; and, contrary to nature, were grafted into the
good olive tree; how much more shall they that are the natural
branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?</span></li>
<li><span>For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, of this
mystery, (lest you should be wise in your own conceits), that
blindness in part has happened in Israel, until the fulness of the
Gentiles should come in.</span></li>
<li><span>And so all Israel should be saved, as it is written:
There shall come out of Sion, he that shall deliver, and shall turn
away ungodliness from Jacob.</span></li>
<li><span>And this is to them my covenant: when I shall take away
their sins.</span></li>
<li><span>As concerning the gospel, indeed, they are enemies for
your sake: but as touching the election, they are most dear for the
sake of the fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>For the gifts and the calling of God are without
repentance.</span></li>
<li><span>For as you also in times past did not believe God, but
now have obtained mercy, through their unbelief;</span></li>
<li><span>So these also now have not believed, for your mercy, that
they also may obtain mercy.</span></li>
<li><span>For God hath concluded all in unbelief, that he may have
mercy on all.</span></li>
<li><span>O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the
knowledge of God! How incomprehensible are his judgments, and how
unsearchable his ways!</span></li>
<li><span>For who hath known the mind of the Lord? Or who hath been
his counsellor?</span></li>
<li><span>Or who hath first given to him, and recompense shall be
made him?</span></li>
<li><span>For of him, and by him, and in him, are all things: to
him be glory for ever. Amen.</span></li>

<li><span>I BESEECH you therefore, brethren, by the mercy of God,
that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, pleasing
unto God, your reasonable service.</span></li>
<li><span>And be not conformed to this world; but be reformed in
the newness of your mind, that you may prove what is the good, and
the acceptable, and the perfect will of God.</span></li>
<li><span>For I say, by the grace that is given me, to all that are
among you, not to be more wise than it behoveth to be wise, but to
be wise unto sobriety, and according as God hath divided to every
one the measure of faith.</span></li>
<li><span>For as in one body we have many members, but all the
members have not the same office:</span></li>
<li><span>So we being many, are one body in Christ, and every one
members one of another.</span></li>
<li><span>And having different gifts, according to the grace that
is given us, either prophecy, to be used according to the rule of
faith;</span></li>
<li><span>Or ministry, in ministering; or he that teacheth, in
doctrine;</span></li>
<li><span>He that exhorteth, in exhorting; he that giveth, with
simplicity; he that ruleth, with carefulness; he that sheweth
mercy, with cheerfulness.</span></li>
<li><span>Let love be without dissimulation. Hating that which is
evil, cleaving to that which is good.</span></li>
<li><span>Loving one another with the charity of brotherhood, with
honour preventing one another.</span></li>
<li><span>In carefulness not slothful. In spirit fervent. Serving
the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Rejoicing in hope. Patient in tribulation. Instant in
prayer.</span></li>
<li><span>Communicating to the necessities of the saints. Pursuing
hospitality.</span></li>
<li><span>Bless them that persecute you: bless, and curse
not.</span></li>
<li><span>Rejoice with them that rejoice; weep with them that
weep.</span></li>
<li><span>Being of one mind one towards another. Not minding high
things, but consenting to the humble. Be not wise in your own
conceits.</span></li>
<li><span>To no man rendering evil for evil. Providing good things,
not only in the sight of God, but also in the sight of all
men.</span></li>
<li><span>If it be possible, as much as is in you, have peace with
all men.</span></li>
<li><span>Revenge not yourselves, my dearly beloved; but give place
unto wrath, for it is written: Revenge is mine, I will repay, saith
the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>But if thy enemy be hungry, give him to eat; if he
thirst, give him to drink. For, doing this, thou shalt heap coals
of fire upon his head.</span></li>

good.</span></li>

<li><span>Let every soul be subject to higher powers: for there is
no power but from God: and those that are, are ordained of
God.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore he that resisteth the power, resisteth the
ordinance of God. And they that resist, purchase to themselves
damnation.</span></li>
<li><span>For princes are not a terror to the good work, but to the
evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is
good: and thou shalt have praise from the same.</span></li>
<li><span>For he is God's minister to thee, for good. But if thou
do that which is evil, fear: for he beareth not the sword in vain.
For he is God's minister: an avenger to execute wrath upon him that
doth evil.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore be subject of necessity, not only for wrath,
but also for conscience' sake.</span></li>
<li><span>For therefore also you pay tribute. For they are the
ministers of God, serving unto this purpose.</span></li>
<li><span>Render therefore to all men their dues. Tribute, to whom
tribute is due: custom, to whom custom: fear, to whom fear: honour,
to whom honour.</span></li>
<li><span>Owe no man any thing, but to love one another. For he
that loveth his neighbour, hath fulfilled the law.</span></li>
<li><span>For Thou shalt not commit adultery: Thou shalt not kill:
Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness: Thou shalt
not covet: and if there be any other commandment, it is comprised
in this word, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</span></li>
<li><span>The love of our neighbour worketh no evil. Love therefore
is the fulfilling of the law.</span></li>
<li><span>And that knowing the season; that it is now the hour for
us to rise from sleep. For now our salvation is nearer than when we
believed.</span></li>
<li><span>The night is passed, and the day is at hand. Let us
therefore cast off the works of darkness, and put on the armour of
light.</span></li>
<li><span>Let us walk honestly, as in the day: not in rioting and
drunkenness, not in chambering and impurities, not in contention
and envy:</span></li>

provision for the flesh in its concupiscences.</span></li>

<li><span>Now him that is weak in faith, take unto you: not in
disputes about thoughts.</span></li>

is weak, let him eat herbs.</span></li>
<li><span>Let not him that eateth, despise him that eateth not: and
he that eateth not, let him not judge him that eateth. For God hath
taken him to him.</span></li>
<li><span>Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? To his
own lord he standeth or falleth. And he shall stand: for God is
able to make him stand.</span></li>
<li><span>For one judgeth between day and day: and another judgeth
every day: let every man abound in his own sense.</span></li>
<li><span>He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord.
And he that eateth, eateth to the Lord: for he giveth thanks to
God. And he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth
thanks to God.</span></li>
<li><span>For none of us liveth to himself; and no man dieth to
himself.</span></li>
<li><span>For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we
die, we die unto the Lord. Therefore, whether we live, or whether
we die, we are the Lord's.</span></li>
<li><span>For to this end Christ died and rose again; that he might
be Lord both of the dead and of the living.</span></li>
<li><span>But thou, why judgest thou thy brother? or thou, why dost
thou despise thy brother? For we shall all stand before the
judgment seat of Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>For it is written: As I live, saith the Lord, every knee
shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore every one of us shall render account to God for
himself.</span></li>
<li><span>Let us not therefore judge one another any more. But
judge this rather, that you put not a stumblingblock or a scandal
in your brother's way.</span></li>
<li><span>I know, and am confident in the Lord Jesus, that nothing
is unclean of itself; but to him that esteemeth any thing to be
unclean, to him it is unclean.</span></li>
<li><span>For if, because of thy meat, thy brother be grieved, thou
walkest not now according to charity. Destroy not him with thy
meat, for whom Christ died.</span></li>
<li><span>Let not then our good be evil spoken of.</span></li>
<li><span>For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but
justice, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</span></li>
<li><span>For he that in this serveth Christ, pleaseth God, and is
approved of men.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore let us follow after the things that are of
peace; and keep the things that are of edification one towards
another.</span></li>
<li><span>Destroy not the work of God for meat. All things indeed
are clean: but it is evil for that man who eateth with
offence.</span></li>
<li><span>It is good not to eat flesh, and not to drink wine, nor
any thing whereby thy brother is offended, or scandalized, or made
weak.</span></li>
<li><span>Hast thou faith? Have it to thyself before God. Blessed
is he that condemneth not himself in that which he
alloweth.</span></li>
<li><span>But he that discerneth, if he eat, is condemned; because
not of faith. For all that is not of faith is sin.</span></li>

of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</span></li>
<li><span>Let every one of you please his neighbour unto good, to
edification.</span></li>
<li><span>For Christ did not please himself, but as it is written:
The reproaches of them that reproached thee, fell upon
me.</span></li>

him, all ye people.</span></li>
<li><span>And again Isaias saith: There shall be a root of Jesse;
and he that shall rise up to rule the Gentiles, in him the Gentiles
shall hope.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in
believing; that you may abound in hope, and in the power of the
Holy Ghost.</span></li>
<li><span>And I myself also, my brethren, am assured of you, that
you also are full of love, replenished with all knowledge, so that
you are able to admonish one another.</span></li>
<li><span>But I have written to you, brethren, more boldly in some
sort, as it were putting you in mind: because of the grace which is
given me from God.</span></li>
<li><span>That I should be the minister of Christ Jesus among the
Gentiles; sanctifying the gospel of God, that the oblation of the
Gentiles may be made acceptable and sanctified in the Holy
Ghost.</span></li>
<li><span>I have therefore glory in Christ Jesus towards
God.</span></li>
<li><span>For I dare not to speak of any of those things which
Christ worketh not by me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by
word and deed,</span></li>
<li><span>By the virtue of signs and wonders, in the power of the
Holy Ghost, so that from Jerusalem round about as far as unto
Illyricum, I have replenished the gospel of Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>And I have so preached this gospel, not where Christ was
named, lest I should build upon another man's
foundation.</span></li>
<li><span>But as it is written: They to whom he was not spoken of,
shall see, and they that have not heard shall
understand.</span></li>
<li><span>For which cause also I was hindered very much from coming
to you, and have been kept away till now.</span></li>
<li><span>But now having no more place in these countries, and
having a great desire these many years past to come unto
you,</span></li>
<li><span>When I shall begin to take my journey into Spain, I hope
that as I pass, I shall see you, and be brought on my way thither
by you, if first, in part, I shall have enjoyed you:</span></li>
<li><span>But now I shall go to Jerusalem, to minister unto the
saints.</span></li>
<li><span>For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make
a contribution for the poor of the saints that are in
Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>For it hath pleased them; and they are their debtors. For
if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things,
they ought also in carnal things to minister to them.</span></li>
<li><span>When therefore I shall have accomplished this, and
consigned to them this fruit, I will come by you into
Spain.</span></li>
<li><span>And I know, that when I come to you, I shall come in the
abundance of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>I beseech you therefore, brethren, through our Lord Jesus
Christ, and by the charity of the Holy Ghost, that you help me in
your prayers for me to God,</span></li>
<li><span>That I may be delivered from the unbelievers that are in
Judea, and that the oblation of my service may be acceptable in
Jerusalem to the saints.</span></li>
<li><span>That I may come to you with joy, by the will of God, and
may be refreshed with you.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</span></li>

<li><span>And I commend to you Phebe, our sister, who is in the
ministry of the church, that is in Cenchrae:</span></li>
<li><span>That you receive her in the Lord as becometh saints; and
that you assist her in whatsoever business she shall have need of
you. For she also hath assisted many, and myself also.</span></li>
<li><span>Salute Prisca and Aquila, my helpers in Christ
Jesus,</span></li>
<li><span>(Who have for my life laid down their own necks: to whom
not I only give thanks, but also all the churches of the
Gentiles,)</span></li>
<li><span>And the church which is in their house. Salute Epenetus,
my beloved: who is the firstfruits of Asia in Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>Salute Mary, who hath laboured much among
you.</span></li>
<li><span>Salute Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen and fellow
prisoners: who are of note among the apostles, who also were in
Christ before me.</span></li>
<li><span>Salute Ampliatus, most beloved to me in the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Salute Urbanus, our helper in Christ Jesus, and Stachys,
my beloved.</span></li>
<li><span>Salute Apelles, approved in Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>Salute them that are of Aristobulus' household. Salute
Herodian, my kinsman. Salute them that are of Narcissus' household,
who are in the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Salute Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord.
Salute Persis, the dearly beloved, who hath much laboured in the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Salute Rufus, elect in the Lord, and his mother and
mine.</span></li>
<li><span>Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and
the brethren that are with them.</span></li>
<li><span>Salute Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and
Olympias; and all the saints that are with them.</span></li>
<li><span>Salute one another with an holy kiss. All the churches of
Christ salute you.</span></li>
<li><span>Now I beseech you, brethren, to mark them who make
dissensions and offences contrary to the doctrine which you have
learned, and avoid them.</span></li>
<li><span>For they that are such, serve not Christ our Lord, but
their own belly; and by pleasing speeches and good words, seduce
the hearts of the innocent.</span></li>
<li><span>For your obedience is published in every place. I rejoice
therefore in you. But I would have you to be wise in good, and
simple in evil.</span></li>
<li><span>And the God of peace crush Satan under your feet
speedily. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with
you.</span></li>
<li><span>Timothy, my fellow labourer, saluteth you, and Lucius,
and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen.</span></li>
<li><span>I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Caius, my host, and the whole church, saluteth you.
Erastus, the treasurer of the city, saluteth you, and Quartus, a
brother.</span></li>
<li><span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
Amen.</span></li>
<li><span>Now to him that is able to establish you, according to my
gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the
revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret from
eternity,</span></li>
<li><span>(Which now is made manifest by the scriptures of the
prophets, according to the precept of the eternal God, for the
obedience of faith,) known among all nations;</span></li>
<li><span>To God the only wise, through Jesus Christ, to whom be
honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span></li>
