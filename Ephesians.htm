  <ol>
    <li><span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God,
    to all the saints who are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in
    Christ Jesus.</span></li>

    <li><span>Grace be to you, and peace from God the Father, and
    from the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></li>

    <li><span>Blessed by the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
    Christ, who hath blessed us with spiritual blessings in
    heavenly places, in Christ:</span></li>

    <li><span>As he chose us in him before the foundation of the
    world, that we should be holy and unspotted in his sight in
    charity.</span></li>

    <li><span>Who hath predestinated us unto the adoption of
    children through Jesus Christ unto himself: according to the
    purpose of his will:</span></li>

    <li><span>Unto the praise of the glory of his grace, in which
    he hath graced us in his beloved son.</span></li>

    <li><span>In whom we have redemption through his blood, the
    remission of sins, according to the riches of his
    grace,</span></li>

    <li><span>Which hath superabounded in us in all wisdom and
    prudence,</span></li>

    <li><span>That he might make known unto us the mystery of his
    will, according to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in
    him,</span></li>

    <li><span>In the dispensation of the fulness of times, to
    re-establish all things in Christ, that are in heaven and on
    earth, in him.</span></li>

    <li><span>In whom we also are called by lot, being
    predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all
    things according to the counsel of his will.</span></li>

    <li><span>That we may be unto the praise of his glory, we who
    before hoped Christ:</span></li>

    <li><span>In whom you also, after you had heard the word of
    truth, (the gospel of your salvation;) in whom also believing,
    you were signed with the holy Spirit of promise,</span></li>

    <li><span>Who is the pledge of our inheritance, unto the
    redemption of acquisition, unto the praise of his
    glory.</span></li>

    <li><span>Wherefore I also, hearing of your faith that is in
    the Lord Jesus, and of your love towards all the
    saints,</span></li>

    <li><span>Cease not to give thanks for you, making
    commemoration of you in my prayers,</span></li>

    <li><span>That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of
    glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and of
    revelation, in the knowledge of him:</span></li>

    <li><span>The eyes of your heart enlightened, that you may know
    what the hope is of the glory of his inheritance in the
    saints.</span></li>

    <li><span>And what is the exceeding greatness of his power
    towards us, who believe according to the operation of the might
    of his power,</span></li>

    <li><span>Which he wrought in Christ, raising him up from the
    dead, and setting him on his right hand in the heavenly
    places.</span></li>

    <li><span>Above all principality, and power, and virtue, and
    dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world,
    but also in that which is to come.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he hath subjected all things under his feet, and
    hath made him head over all the church,</span></li>

    <li><span>Which is his body, and the fulness of him who is
    filled all in all.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="2">Ephesians 2</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And you, when you were dead in your offences, and
    sins,</span></li>

    <li><span>Wherein in time past you walked according to the
    course of this world, according to the prince of the power of
    this air, of the spirit that now worketh on the children of
    unbelief:</span></li>

    <li><span>In which also we all conversed in time past, in the
    desires of our flesh, fulfilling the will of the flesh and of
    our thoughts, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the
    rest:</span></li>

    <li><span>But God, (who is rich in mercy,) for his exceeding
    charity wherewith he loved us,</span></li>

    <li><span>Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us
    together in Christ, (by whose grace you are saved,)</span></li>

    <li><span>And hath raised us up together, and hath made us sit
    together in the heavenly places, through Christ
    Jesus.</span></li>

    <li><span>That he might shew in the ages to come the abundant
    riches of his grace, in his bounty towards us in Christ
    Jesus.</span></li>

    <li><span>For by grace you are saved through faith, and that
    not of yourselves, for it is the gift of God;</span></li>

    <li><span>Not of works, that no man may glory.</span></li>

    <li><span>For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus
    in good works, which God hath prepared that we should walk in
    them.</span></li>

    <li><span>For which cause be mindful that you, being heretofore
    Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by that
    which is called circumcision in the flesh, made by
    hands;</span></li>

    <li><span>That you were at that time without Christ, being
    aliens from the conversation of Israel, and strangers to the
    testament, having no hope of the promise, and without God in
    this world.</span></li>

    <li><span>But now in Christ Jesus, you, who some time were afar
    off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ.</span></li>

    <li><span>For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and
    breaking down the middle wall of partition, the enmities in his
    flesh:</span></li>

    <li><span>Making void the law of commandments contained in
    decrees; that he might make the two in himself into one new
    man, making peace;</span></li>

    <li><span>And might reconcile both to God in one body by the
    cross, killing the enmities in himself.</span></li>

    <li><span>And coming, he preached peace to you that were afar
    off, and peace to them that were nigh.</span></li>

    <li><span>For by him we have access both in one Spirit to the
    Father.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now therefore you are no more strangers and
    foreigners; but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and
    the domestics of God,</span></li>

    <li><span>Built upon the foundation of the apostles and
    prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner
    stone:</span></li>

    <li><span>In whom all the building, being framed together,
    groweth up into an holy temple in the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>In whom you also are built together into an
    habitation of God in the Spirit.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="3">Ephesians 3</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>For this cause, I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ,
    for you Gentiles;</span></li>

    <li><span>If yet you have heard of the dispensation of the
    grace of God which is given me towards you:</span></li>

    <li><span>How that, according to revelation, the mystery has
    been made known to me, as I have written above in a few
    words;</span></li>

    <li><span>As you reading, may understand my knowledge in the
    mystery of Christ,</span></li>

    <li><span>Which in other generations was not known to the sons
    of men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets
    in the Spirit:</span></li>

    <li><span>That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the
    same body, and co-partners of his promise in Christ Jesus, by
    the gospel:</span></li>

    <li><span>Of which I am made a minister, according to the gift
    of the grace of God, which is given to me according to the
    operation of his power:</span></li>

    <li><span>To me, the least of all the saints, is given this
    grace, to preach among the Gentiles, the unsearchable riches of
    Christ,</span></li>

    <li><span>And to enlighten all men, that they may see what is
    the dispensation of the mystery which hath been hidden from
    eternity in God, who created all things:</span></li>

    <li><span>That the manifold wisdom of God may be made known to
    the principalities and powers in heavenly places through the
    church,</span></li>

    <li><span>According to the eternal purpose, which he made, in
    Christ Jesus our Lord:</span></li>

    <li><span>In whom we have boldness and access with confidence
    by the faith of him.</span></li>

    <li><span>Wherefore I pray you not to faint at my tribulations
    for you, which is your glory.</span></li>

    <li><span>For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our
    Lord Jesus Christ,</span></li>

    <li><span>Of whom all paternity in heaven and earth is
    named,</span></li>

    <li><span>That he would grant you, according to the riches of
    his glory, to be strengthened by his Spirit with might unto the
    inward man,</span></li>

    <li><span>That Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts; that
    being rooted and founded in charity,</span></li>

    <li><span>You may be able to comprehend, with all the saints,
    what is the breadth, and length, and height, and
    depth:</span></li>

    <li><span>To know also the charity of Christ, which surpasseth
    all knowledge, that you may be filled unto all the fulness of
    God.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now to him who is able to do all things more
    abundantly than we desire or understand, according to the power
    that worketh in us;</span></li>

    <li><span>To him be glory in the church, and in Christ Jesus
    unto all generations, world without end. Amen.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="4">Ephesians 4</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>I therefore, a prisoner in the Lord, beseech you that
    you walk worthy of the vocation in which you are
    called,</span></li>

    <li><span>With all humility and mildness, with patience,
    supporting one another in charity.</span></li>

    <li><span>Careful to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond
    of peace.</span></li>

    <li><span>One body and one Spirit; as you are called in one
    hope of your calling.</span></li>

    <li><span>One Lord, one faith, one baptism.</span></li>

    <li><span>One God and Father of all, who is above all, and
    through all, and in us all.</span></li>

    <li><span>But to every one of us is given grace, according to
    the measure of the giving of Christ.</span></li>

    <li><span>Wherefore he saith: Ascending on high, he led
    captivity captive; he gave gifts to men.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now that he ascended, what is it, but because he also
    descended first into the lower parts of the earth?</span></li>

    <li><span>He that descended is the same also that ascended
    above all the heavens, that he might fill all
    things.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he gave some apostles, and some prophets, and
    other some evangelists, and other some pastors and
    doctors,</span></li>

    <li><span>For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the
    ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:</span></li>

    <li><span>Until we all meet into the unity of faith, and of the
    knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the
    measure of the age of the fulness of Christ;</span></li>

    <li><span>That henceforth we be no more children tossed to and
    fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the
    wickedness of men, by cunning craftiness, by which they lie in
    wait to deceive</span></li>

    <li><span>But doing the truth in charity, we may in all things
    grow up in him who is the head, even Christ:</span></li>

    <li><span>From whom the whole body, being compacted and fitly
    joined together, by what every joint supplieth, according to
    the operation in the measure of every part, maketh increase of
    the body, unto the edifying of itself in charity.</span></li>

    <li><span>This then I say and testify in the Lord: That
    henceforward you walk not as also the Gentiles walk in the
    vanity of their mind,</span></li>

    <li><span>Having their understanding darkened, being alienated
    from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them,
    because of the blindness of their hearts.</span></li>

    <li><span>Who despairing, have given themselves up to
    lasciviousness, unto the working of all uncleanness, unto the
    working of all uncleanness, unto covetousness.</span></li>

    <li><span>But you have not so learned Christ;</span></li>

    <li><span>If so be that you have heard him, and have been
    taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus:</span></li>

    <li><span>To put off, according to former conversation, the old
    man, who is corrupted according to the desire of
    error.</span></li>

    <li><span>And be renewed in the spirit of your
    mind:</span></li>

    <li><span>And put on the new man, who according to God is
    created in justice and holiness of truth.</span></li>

    <li><span>Wherefore putting away lying, speak ;ye the truth
    every man with his neighbour; for we are members one of
    another.</span></li>

    <li><span>Be angry, and sin not. Let not the sun go down upon
    your anger.</span></li>

    <li><span>Give not place to the devil.</span></li>

    <li><span>He that stole, let him now steal no more; but rather
    let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good,
    that he may have something to give to him that suffereth
    need.</span></li>

    <li><span>Let no evil speech proceed from your mouth; but that
    which is good, to the edification of faith, that it may
    administer grace to the hearers.</span></li>

    <li><span>And grieve not the holy Spirit of God: whereby you
    are sealed unto the day of redemption.</span></li>

    <li><span>Let all bitterness, and anger, and indignation, and
    clamour, and blasphemy, be put away from you, with all
    malice.</span></li>

    <li><span>And be ye kind one to another; merciful, forgiving
    one another, even as God hath forgiven you in
    Christ.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="5">Ephesians 5</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Be ye therefore followers of God, as most dear
    children;</span></li>

    <li><span>And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and
    hath delivered himself for us, an oblation and a sacrifice to
    God for an odour of sweetness.</span></li>

    <li><span>But fornication, and all uncleanness, or
    covetousness, let it not so much as be named among you, as
    becometh saints:</span></li>

    <li><span>Or obscenity, or foolish talking, or scurrility,
    which is to no purpose; but rather giving of
    thanks.</span></li>

    <li><span>For know you this and understand, that no fornicator,
    or unclean, or covetous person (which is a serving of idols),
    hath inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of
    God.</span></li>

    <li><span>Let no man deceive you with vain words. For because
    of these things cometh the anger of God upon the children of
    unbelief.</span></li>

    <li><span>Be ye not therefore partakers with them.</span></li>

    <li><span>For you were heretofore darkness, but now light in
    the Lord. Walk then as children of the light.</span></li>

    <li><span>For the fruit of the light is in all goodness, and
    justice, and truth;</span></li>

    <li><span>Proving what is well pleasing to God:</span></li>

    <li><span>And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of
    darkness, but rather reprove them.</span></li>

    <li><span>For the things that are done by them in secret, it is
    a shame even to speak of.</span></li>

    <li><span>But all things that are reproved, are made manifest
    by the light; for all that is made manifest is
    light.</span></li>

    <li><span>Wherefore he saith: Rise thou that sleepest, and
    arise from the dead: and Christ shall enlighten
    thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>See therefore, brethren, how you walk circumspectly:
    not as unwise,</span></li>

    <li><span>But as wise: redeeming the time, because the days are
    evil.</span></li>

    <li><span>Wherefore become not unwise, but understanding what
    is the will of God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And be not drunk with wine, wherein is luxury; but be
    ye filled with the holy Spirit,</span></li>

    <li><span>Speaking to yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and
    spiritual canticles, singing and making melody in your hearts
    to the Lord;</span></li>

    <li><span>Giving thanks always for all things, in the name of
    our Lord Jesus Christ, to God and the Father:</span></li>

    <li><span>Being subject one to another, in the fear of
    Christ.</span></li>

    <li><span>Let women be subject to their husbands, as to the
    Lord:</span></li>

    <li><span>Because the husband is the head of the wife, as
    Christ is the head of the church. He is the saviour of his
    body.</span></li>

    <li><span>Therefore as the church is subject to Christ, so also
    let the wives be to their husbands in all things.</span></li>

    <li><span>Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the
    church, and delivered himself up for it:</span></li>

    <li><span>That he might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver
    of water in the word of life:</span></li>

    <li><span>That he might present it to himself a glorious
    church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any; such thing; but
    that it should be holy, and without blemish.</span></li>

    <li><span>So also ought men to love their wives as their own
    bodies. He that loveth his wife, loveth himself.</span></li>

    <li><span>For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth
    and cherisheth it, as also Christ doth the church:</span></li>

    <li><span>Because we are members of his body, of his flesh, and
    of his bones.</span></li>

    <li><span>For this cause shall a man leave his father and
    mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall be two in
    one flesh.</span></li>

    <li><span>This is a great sacrament; but I speak in Christ and
    in the church.</span></li>

    <li><span>Nevertheless let every one of you in particular love
    his wife as himself: and let the wife fear her
    husband.</span></li>
  </ol></div>

  <div class="chapter"><div class="chaptertitle"><a name="6">Ephesians 6</a></div>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is
    just.</span></li>

    <li><span>Honour thy father and thy mother, which is the first
    commandment with a promise:</span></li>

    <li><span>That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest be
    long lived upon earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And you, fathers, provoke not your children to anger;
    but bring them up in the discipline and correction of the
    Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>Servants, be obedient to them that are your lords
    according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the
    simplicity of your heart, as to Christ:</span></li>

    <li><span>Not serving to the eye, as it were pleasing men, but,
    as the servants of Christ doing the will of God from the
    heart,</span></li>

    <li><span>With a good will serving, as to the Lord, and not to
    men.</span></li>

    <li><span>Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man shall do,
    the same shall he receive from the Lord, whether he be bond, or
    free.</span></li>

    <li><span>And you, masters, do the same things to them,
    forbearing threatenings, knowing that the Lord both of them and
    you is in heaven; and there is no respect of persons with
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>Finally, brethren, be strengthened in the Lord, and
    in the might of his power.</span></li>

    <li><span>Put you on the armour of God, that you may be able to
    stand against the deceits of the devil.</span></li>

    <li><span>For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood; but
    against principalities and power, against the rulers of the
    world of this darkness, against the spirits of wickedness in
    the high places.</span></li>

    <li><span>Therefore take unto you the armour of God, that you
    may be able to resist in the evil day, and to stand in all
    things perfect.</span></li>

    <li><span>Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with
    truth, and having on the breastplate of justice,</span></li>

    <li><span>And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel
    of peace:</span></li>

    <li><span>In all things taking the shield of faith, wherewith
    you may be able to extinguish all the fiery darts of the most
    wicked one.</span></li>

    <li><span>And take unto you the helmet of salvation, and the
    sword of the Spirit (which is the word of God).</span></li>

    <li><span>By all prayer and supplication praying at all times
    in the spirit; and in the same watching with all instance and
    supplication for all the saints:</span></li>

    <li><span>And for me, that speech may be given me, that I may
    open my mouth with confidence, to make known the mystery of the
    gospel.</span></li>

    <li><span>For which I am an ambassador in a chain, so that
    therein I may be bold to speak according as I
    ought.</span></li>

    <li><span>But that you also may know the things that concern
    me, and what I am doing, Tychicus, my dearest brother and
    faithful minister in the Lord, will make known to you all
    things:</span></li>

    <li><span>Whom I have sent to you for this same purpose, that
    you may know the things concerning us, and that he may comfort
    your hearts.</span></li>

    <li><span>Peace be to the brethren and charity with faith, from
    God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></li>

    <li><span>Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus
    Christ in incorruption. Amen.</span></li>
