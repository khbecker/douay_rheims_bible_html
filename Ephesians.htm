that he might make the two in himself into one new man, making peace;<li>And might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, killing the enmities in himself.<li>And coming, he preached peace to you that were afar off, and peace to them that were nigh.<li>For by him we have access both in one Spirit to the Father.<li>Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners; but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and the domestics of God,<li>Built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone:<li>In whom all the building, being framed together, groweth up into an holy temple in the Lord.<li>In whom you also are built together into an habitation of God in the Spirit.</ol><h2><a name=3>Ephesians 3</a></h2><ol><li>For this cause, I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ, for you Gentiles;<li>If yet you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me towards you:<li>How that, according to revelation, the mystery has been made known to me, as I have written above in a few words;<li>As you reading, may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ,<li>Which in other generations was not known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit:<li>That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and co-partners of his promise in Christ Jesus, by the gospel:<li>Of which I am made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God, which is given to me according to the operation of his power:<li>To me, the least of all the saints, is given this grace, to preach among the Gentiles, the unsearchable riches of Christ,<li>And to enlighten all men, that they may see what is the dispensation of the mystery which hath been hidden from eternity in God, who created all things:<li>That the manifold wisdom of God may be made known to the principalities and powers in heavenly places through the church,<li>According to the eternal purpose, which he made, in Christ Jesus our Lord:<li>In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.<li>Wherefore I pray you not to faint at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.<li>For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,<li>Of whom all paternity in heaven and earth is named,<li>That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened by his Spirit with might unto the inward man,<li>That Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts; that being rooted and founded in charity,<li>You may be able to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth, and length, and height, and depth:<li>To know also the charity of Christ, which surpasseth all knowledge, that you may be filled unto all the fulness of God.<li>Now to him who is able to do all things more abundantly than we desire or understand, according to the power that worketh in us;<li>To him be glory in the church, and in Christ Jesus unto all generations, world without end. Amen.</ol><h2><a name=4>Ephesians 4</a></h2><ol><li>I therefore, a prisoner in the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation in which you are called,<li>With all humility and mildness, with patience, supporting one another in charity.<li>Careful to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.<li>One body and one Spirit; as you are called in one hope of your calling.<li>One Lord, one faith, one baptism.<li>One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in us all.<li>But to every one of us is given grace, according to the measure of the giving of Christ.<li>Wherefore he saith: Ascending on high, he led captivity captive; he gave gifts to men.<li>Now that he ascended, what is it, but because he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?<li>He that descended is the same also that ascended above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.<li>And he gave some apostles, and some prophets, and other some evangelists, and other some pastors and doctors,<li>For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:<li>Until we all meet into the unity of faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the age of the fulness of Christ;<li>That henceforth we be no more children tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the wickedness of men, by cunning craftiness, by which they lie in wait to deceive<li>But doing the truth in charity, we may in all things grow up in him who is the head, even Christ:<li>From whom the whole body, being compacted and fitly joined together, by what every joint supplieth, according to the operation in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body, unto the edifying of itself in charity.<li>This then I say and testify in the Lord: That henceforward you walk not as also the Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind,<li>Having their understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their hearts.<li>Who despairing, have given themselves up to lasciviousness, unto the working of all uncleanness, unto the working of all uncleanness, unto covetousness.<li>But you have not so learned Christ;<li>If so be that you have heard him, and have been taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus:<li>To put off, according to former conversation, the old man, who is corrupted according to the desire of error.<li>And be renewed in the spirit of your mind:<li>And put on the new man, who according to God is created in justice and holiness of truth.<li>Wherefore putting away lying, speak ;ye the truth every man with his neighbour; for we are members one of another.<li>Be angry, and sin not. Let not the sun go down upon your anger.<li>Give not place to the devil.<li>He that stole, let him now steal no more; but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have something to give to him that suffereth need.<li>Let no evil speech proceed from your mouth; but that which is good, to the edification of faith, that it may administer grace to the hearers.<li>And grieve not the holy Spirit of God: whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption.<li>Let all bitterness, and anger, and indignation, and clamour, and blasphemy, be put away from you, with all malice.<li>And be ye kind one to another; merciful, forgiving one another, even as God hath forgiven you in Christ.</ol><h2><a name=5>Ephesians 5</a></h2><ol><li>Be ye therefore followers of God, as most dear children;<li>And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath delivered himself for us, an oblation and a sacrifice to God for an odour of sweetness.<li>But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not so much as be named among you, as becometh saints:<li>Or obscenity, or foolish talking, or scurrility, which is to no purpose; but rather giving of thanks.<li>For know you this and understand, that no fornicator, or unclean, or covetous person (which is a serving of idols), hath inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.<li>Let no man deceive you with vain words. For because of these things cometh the anger of God upon the children of unbelief.<li>Be ye not therefore partakers with them.<li>For you were heretofore darkness, but now light in the Lord. Walk then as children of the light.<li>For the fruit of the light is in all goodness, and justice, and truth;<li>Proving what is well pleasing to God:<li>And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.<li>For the things that are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.<li>But all things that are reproved, are made manifest by the light; for all that is made manifest is light.<li>Wherefore he saith: Rise thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead: and Christ shall enlighten thee.<li>See therefore, brethren, how you walk circumspectly: not as unwise,<li>But as wise: redeeming the time, because the days are evil.<li>Wherefore become not unwise, but understanding what is the will of God.<li>And be not drunk with wine, wherein is luxury; but be ye filled with the holy Spirit,<li>Speaking to yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual canticles, singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord;<li>Giving thanks always for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God and the Father:<li>Being subject one to another, in the fear of Christ.<li>Let women be subject to their husbands, as to the Lord:<li>Because the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church. He is the saviour of his body.<li>Therefore as the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be to their husbands in all things.<li>Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church, and delivered himself up for it:<li>That he might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life:<li>That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any; such thing; but that it should be holy, and without blemish.<li>So also ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife, loveth himself.<li>For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, as also Christ doth the church:<li>Because we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.<li>For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh.<li>This is a great sacrament; but I speak in Christ and in the church.<li>Nevertheless let every one of you in particular love his wife as himself: and let the wife fear her husband.</ol><h2><a name=6>Ephesians 6</a></h2><ol><li>Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is just.<li>Honour thy father and thy mother, which is the first commandment with a promise:<li>That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest be long lived upon earth.<li>And you, fathers, provoke not your children to anger; but bring them up in the discipline and correction of the Lord.<li>Servants, be obedient to them that are your lords according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the simplicity of your heart, as to Christ:<li>Not serving to the eye, as it were pleasing men, but, as the servants of Christ doing the will of God from the heart,<li>With a good will serving, as to the Lord, and not to men.<li>Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man shall do, the same shall he receive from the Lord, whether he be bond, or free.<li>And you, masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatenings, knowing that the Lord both of them and you is in heaven; and there is no respect of persons with him.<li>Finally, brethren, be strengthened in the Lord, and in the might of his power.<li>Put you on the armour of God, that you may be able to stand against the deceits of the devil.<li>For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood; but against principalities and power, against the rulers of the world of this darkness, against the spirits of wickedness in the high places.<li>Therefore take unto you the armour of God, that you may be able to resist in the evil day, and to stand in all things perfect.<li>Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of justice,<li>And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace:<li>In all things taking the shield of faith, wherewith you may be able to extinguish all the fiery darts of the most wicked one.<li>And take unto you the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit (which is the word of God).<li>By all prayer and supplication praying at all times in the spirit; and in the same watching with all instance and supplication for all the saints:<li>And for me, that speech may be given me, that I may open my mouth with confidence, to make known the mystery of the gospel.<li>For which I am an ambassador in a chain, so that therein I may be bold to speak according as I ought.<li>But that you also may know the things that concern me, and what I am doing, Tychicus, my dearest brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make known to you all things:<li>Whom I have sent to you for this same purpose, that you may know the things concerning us, and that he may comfort your hearts.<li>Peace be to the brethren and charity with faith, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.<li>Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption. Amen.</ol></body></html>
