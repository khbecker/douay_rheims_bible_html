<ol>
<li><span>Paul, an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by
Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the
dead,</span></li>
<li><span>And all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of
Galatia.</span></li>
<li><span>Grace be to you, and peace from God the Father, and from
our Lord Jesus Christ,</span></li>
<li><span>Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us
from this present wicked world, according to the will of God and
our Father:</span></li>
<li><span>To whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen.</span></li>
<li><span>I wonder that you are so soon removed from him that
called you into the grace of Christ, unto another
gospel.</span></li>
<li><span>Which is not another, only there are some that trouble
you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel
to you besides that which we have preached to you, let him be
anathema.</span></li>
<li><span>As we said before, so now I say again: If any one preach
to you a gospel, besides that which you have received, let him be
anathema.</span></li>
<li><span>For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please
men? If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of
Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>For I give you to understand, brethren, that the gospel
which was preached by me is not according to man.</span></li>
<li><span>For neither did I receive it of man, nor did I learn it;
but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the
Jews' religion: how that, beyond measure, I persecuted the church
of God, and wasted it.</span></li>
<li><span>And I made progress in the Jews' religion above many of
my equals in my own nation, being more abundantly zealous for the
traditions of my fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>But when it pleased him, who separated me from my
mother's womb, and called me by his grace,</span></li>
<li><span>To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among
the Gentiles, immediately I condescended not to flesh and
blood.</span></li>
<li><span>Neither went I to Jerusalem, to the apostles who were
before me: but I went into Arabia, and again I returned to
Damascus.</span></li>
<li><span>Then, after three years, I went to Jerusalem, to see
Peter, and I tarried with him fifteen days.</span></li>
<li><span>But other of the apostles I saw none, saving James the
brother of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God,
I lie not.</span></li>
<li><span>Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and
Cilicia.</span></li>
<li><span>And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which
were in Christ:</span></li>
<li><span>But they had heard only: He, who persecuted us in times
past, doth now preach the faith which once he impugned:</span></li>
<li><span>And they glorified God in me.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="2">Galatians 2</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Then, after fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem
with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.</span></li>
<li><span>And I went up according to revelation; and communicated
to them the gospel, which I preach among the Gentiles, but apart to
them who seemed to be some thing: lest perhaps I should run, or had
run in vain.</span></li>
<li><span>But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Gentile, was
compelled to be circumcised.</span></li>
<li><span>But because of false brethren unawares brought in, who
came in privately to spy our liberty, which we have in Christ
Jesus, that they might bring us into servitude.</span></li>
<li><span>To whom we yielded not by subjection, no not for an hour,
that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.</span></li>
<li><span>But of them who seemed to be some thing, (what they were
some time, it is nothing to me, God accepteth not the person of
man,) for to me they that seemed to be some thing added
nothing.</span></li>
<li><span>But contrariwise, when they had seen that to me was
committed the gospel of the uncircumcision, as to Peter was that of
the circumcision.</span></li>
<li><span>(For he who wrought in Peter to the apostleship of the
circumcision, wrought in me also among the Gentiles.)</span></li>
<li><span>And when they had known the grace that was given to me,
James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, gave to me and
Barnabas the right hands of fellowship: that we should go unto the
Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision:</span></li>
<li><span>Only that we should be mindful of the poor: which same
thing also I was careful to do.</span></li>
<li><span>But when Cephas was come to Antioch, I withstood him to
the face, because he was to be blamed.</span></li>
<li><span>For before that some came from James, he did eat with the
Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated
himself, fearing them who were of the circumcision.</span></li>
<li><span>And to his dissimulation the rest of the Jews consented,
so that Barnabas also was led by them into that
dissimulation.</span></li>
<li><span>But when I saw that they walked not uprightly unto the
truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all: If thou,
being a Jew, livest after the manner of the Gentiles, and not as
the Jews do, how dost thou compel the Gentiles to live as do the
Jews?</span></li>
<li><span>We by nature are Jews, and not of the Gentiles
sinners.</span></li>
<li><span>But knowing that man is not justified by the works of the
law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ; we also believe in Christ
Jesus, that we may be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by
the works of the law: because by the works of the law no flesh
shall be justified.</span></li>
<li><span>But if while we seek to be justified in Christ, we
ourselves also are found sinners; is Christ then the minister of
sin? God forbid.</span></li>
<li><span>For if I build up again the things which I have
destroyed, I make myself a prevaricator.</span></li>
<li><span>For I, through the law, am dead to the law, that I may
live to God: with Christ I am nailed to the cross.</span></li>
<li><span>And I live, now not I; but Christ liveth in me. And that
I live now in the flesh: I live in the faith of the Son of God, who
loved me, and delivered himself for me.</span></li>
<li><span>I cast not away the grace of God. For if justice be by
the law, then Christ died in vain.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="3">Galatians 3</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>O senseless Galatians, who hath bewitched you that you
should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been
set forth, crucified among you?</span></li>
<li><span>This only would I learn of you: Did you receive the
Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of
faith?</span></li>
<li><span>Are you so foolish, that, whereas you began in the
Spirit, you would now be made perfect by the flesh?</span></li>
<li><span>Have you suffered so great things in vain? If it be yet
in vain.</span></li>
<li><span>He therefore who giveth to you the Spirit, and worketh
miracles among you; doth he do it by the works of the law, or by
the hearing of the faith?</span></li>
<li><span>As it is written: Abraham believed God, and it was
reputed to him unto justice.</span></li>
<li><span>Know ye therefore, that they who are of faith, the same
are the children of Abraham.</span></li>
<li><span>And the scripture, foreseeing, that God justifieth the
Gentiles by faith, told unto Abraham before: In thee shall all
nations be blessed.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore they that are of faith, shall be blessed with
faithful Abraham.</span></li>
<li><span>For as many as are of the works of the law, are under a
curse. For it is written: Cursed is every one, that abideth not in
all things, which are written in the book of the law to do
them.</span></li>
<li><span>But that in the law no man is justified with God, it is
manifest: because the just man liveth by faith.</span></li>
<li><span>But the law is not of faith: but, He that doth those
things, shall live in them.</span></li>
<li><span>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being
made a curse for us: for it is written: Cursed is every one that
hangeth on a tree:</span></li>
<li><span>That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles
through Christ Jesus: that we may receive the promise of the Spirit
by faith.</span></li>
<li><span>Brethren (I speak after the manner of man,) yet a man's
testament, if it be confirmed, no man despiseth, nor addeth to
it.</span></li>
<li><span>To Abraham were the promises made and to his seed. He
saith not, And to his seeds, as of many: but as of one, And to thy
seed, which is Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>Now this I say, that the testament which was confirmed by
God, the law which was made after four hundred and thirty years,
doth not disannul, to make the promise of no effect.</span></li>
<li><span>For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of
promise. But God gave it to Abraham by promise.</span></li>
<li><span>Why then was the law? It was set because of
transgressions, until the seed should come, to whom he made the
promise, being ordained by angels in the hand of a
mediator.</span></li>
<li><span>Now a mediator is not of one: but God is one.</span></li>
<li><span>Was the law then against the promises of God? God forbid.
For if there had been a law given which could give life, verily
justice should have been by the law.</span></li>
<li><span>But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the
promise, by the faith of Jesus Christ, might be given to them that
believe.</span></li>
<li><span>But before the faith came, we were kept under the law
shut up, unto that faith which was to be revealed.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore the law was our pedagogue in Christ, that we
might be justified by faith.</span></li>
<li><span>But after the faith is come, we are no longer under a
pedagogue.</span></li>
<li><span>For you are all the children of God by faith, in Christ
Jesus.</span></li>
<li><span>For as many of you as have been baptized in Christ, have
put on Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>There is neither Jew nor Greek: there is neither bond nor
free: there is neither male nor female. For you are all one in
Christ Jesus.</span></li>
<li><span>And if you be Christ's, then are you the seed of Abraham,
heirs according to the promise.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="4">Galatians 4</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he differeth
nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;</span></li>
<li><span>But is under tutors and governors until the time
appointed by the father:</span></li>
<li><span>So we also, when we were children, were serving under the
elements of the world.</span></li>
<li><span>But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent his
Son, made of a woman, made under the law:</span></li>
<li><span>That he might redeem them who were under the law: that we
might receive the adoption of sons.</span></li>
<li><span>And because you are sons, God hath sent the Spirit of his
Son into your hearts, crying: Abba, Father.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore now he is not a servant, but a son. And if a
son, an heir also through God.</span></li>
<li><span>But then indeed, not knowing God, you served them, who,
by nature, are not gods.</span></li>
<li><span>But now, after that you have known God, or rather are
known by God: how turn you again to the weak and needy elements,
which you desire to serve again?</span></li>
<li><span>You observe days, and months, and times, and
years.</span></li>
<li><span>I am afraid of you, lest perhaps I have laboured in vain
among you.</span></li>
<li><span>Be ye as I, because I also am as you: brethren, I beseech
you: you have not injured me at all.</span></li>
<li><span>And you know, how through infirmity of the flesh, I
preached the gospel to you heretofore: and your temptation in my
flesh,</span></li>
<li><span>You despised not, nor rejected: but received me as an
angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.</span></li>
<li><span>Where is then your blessedness? For I bear you witness,
that, if it could be done, you would have plucked out your own
eyes, and would have given them to me.</span></li>
<li><span>Am I then become your enemy, because I tell you the
truth?</span></li>
<li><span>They are zealous in your regard not well: but they would
exclude you, that you might be zealous for them.</span></li>
<li><span>But be zealous for that which is good in a good thing
always: and not only when I am present with you.</span></li>
<li><span>My little children, of whom I am in labour again, until
Christ be formed in you.</span></li>
<li><span>And I would willingly be present with you now, and change
my voice: because I am ashamed for you.</span></li>
<li><span>Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, have you
not read the law?</span></li>
<li><span>For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a
bondwoman, and the other by a free woman.</span></li>
<li><span>But he who was of the bondwoman, was born according to
the flesh: but he of the free woman, was by promise.</span></li>
<li><span>Which things are said by an allegory. For these are the
two testaments. The one from mount Sina, engendering unto bondage;
which is Agar:</span></li>
<li><span>For Sina is a mountain in Arabia, which hath affinity to
that Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her
children.</span></li>
<li><span>But that Jerusalem, which is above, is free: which is our
mother.</span></li>
<li><span>For it is written: Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest
not: break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for many are
the children of the desolate, more than of her that hath a
husband.</span></li>
<li><span>Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of
promise.</span></li>
<li><span>But as then he, that was born according to the flesh,
persecuted him that was after the spirit; so also it is
now.</span></li>
<li><span>But what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and
her son; for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the
son of the free woman.</span></li>
<li><span>So then, brethren, we are not the children of the
bondwoman, but of the free: by the freedom wherewith Christ has
made us free.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="5">Galatians 5</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Stand fast, and be not held again under the yoke of
bondage.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold, I Paul tell you, that if you be circumcised,
Christ shall profit you nothing.</span></li>
<li><span>And I testify again to every man circumcising himself,
that he is a debtor to the whole law.</span></li>
<li><span>You are made void of Christ, you who are justified in the
law: you are fallen from grace.</span></li>
<li><span>For we in spirit, by faith, wait for the hope of
justice.</span></li>
<li><span>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any
thing, nor uncircumcision: but faith that worketh by
charity.</span></li>
<li><span>You did run well, who hath hindered you, that you should
not obey the truth?</span></li>
<li><span>This persuasion is not from him that calleth
you.</span></li>
<li><span>A little leaven corrupteth the whole lump.</span></li>
<li><span>I have confidence in you in the Lord: that you will not
be of another mind: but he that troubleth you, shall bear the
judgment, whosoever he be.</span></li>
<li><span>And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I
yet suffer persecution? Then is the scandal of the cross made
void.</span></li>
<li><span>I would they were even cut off, who trouble
you.</span></li>
<li><span>For you, brethren, have been called unto liberty: only
make not liberty an occasion to the flesh, but by charity of the
spirit serve one another.</span></li>
<li><span>For all the law is fulfilled in one word: Thou shalt love
thy neighbour as thyself.</span></li>
<li><span>But if you bite and devour one another; take heed you be
not consumed one of another.</span></li>
<li><span>I say then, walk in the spirit, and you shall not fulfil
the lusts of the flesh.</span></li>
<li><span>For the flesh lusteth against the spirit: and the spirit
against the flesh; for these are contrary one to another: so that
you do not the things that you would.</span></li>
<li><span>But if you are led by the spirit, you are not under the
law.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are
fornication, uncleanness, immodesty, luxury,</span></li>
<li><span>Idolatry, witchcrafts, enmities, contentions, emulations,
wraths, quarrels, dissensions, sects,</span></li>
<li><span>Envies, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like.
Of the which I foretell you, as I have foretold to you, that they
who do such things shall not obtain the kingdom of God.</span></li>
<li><span>But the fruit of the Spirit is, charity, joy, peace,
patience, benignity, goodness, longanimity,</span></li>
<li><span>Mildness, faith, modesty, continency, chastity. Against
such there is no law.</span></li>
<li><span>And they that are Christ's, have crucified their flesh,
with the vices and concupiscences.</span></li>
<li><span>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the
Spirit.</span></li>
<li><span>Let us not be made desirous of vain glory, provoking one
another, envying on another.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="6">Galatians 6</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Brethren, and if a man be overtaken in any fault, you,
who are spiritual, instruct such a one in the spirit of meekness,
considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</span></li>
<li><span>Bear ye one another's burdens; and so you shall fulfil
the law of Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>For if any man think himself to be some thing, whereas he
is nothing, he deceiveth himself.</span></li>
<li><span>But let every one prove his own work, and so he shall
have glory in himself only, and not in another.</span></li>
<li><span>For every one shall bear his own burden.</span></li>
<li><span>And let him that is instructed in the word, communicate
to him that instructeth him, in all good things.</span></li>
<li><span>Be not deceived, God is not mocked.</span></li>
<li><span>For what things a man shall sow, those also shall he
reap. For he that soweth in his flesh, of the flesh also shall reap
corruption. But he that soweth in the spirit, of the spirit shall
reap life everlasting.</span></li>
<li><span>And in doing good, let us not fail. For in due time we
shall reap, not failing.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore, whilst we have time, let us work good to all
men, but especially to those who are of the household of the
faith.</span></li>
<li><span>See what a letter I have written to you with my own
hand.</span></li>
<li><span>For as many as desire to please in the flesh, they
constrain you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer the
persecution of the cross of Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>For neither they themselves who are circumcised, keep the
law; but they will have you to be circumcised, that they may glory
in your flesh.</span></li>
<li><span>But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of
our Lord Jesus Christ; by whom the world is crucified to me, and I
to the world.</span></li>
<li><span>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any
thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</span></li>
<li><span>And whosoever shall follow this rule, peace on them, and
mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</span></li>
<li><span>From henceforth let no man be troublesome to me; for I
bear the marks of the Lord Jesus in my body.</span></li>
<li><span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit,
brethren. Amen.</span></li>
