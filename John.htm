<ol>
<li><span>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
and the Word was God.</span></li>
<li><span>The same was in the beginning with God.</span></li>
<li><span>All things were made by him: and without him was made
nothing that was made.</span></li>
<li><span>In him was life, and the life was the light of
men.</span></li>
<li><span>And the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness did
not comprehend it.</span></li>
<li><span>There was a man sent from God, whose name was
John.</span></li>
<li><span>This man came for a witness, to give testimony of the
light, that all men might believe through him.</span></li>
<li><span>He was not the light, but was to give testimony of the
light.</span></li>
<li><span>That was the true light, which enlighteneth every man
that cometh into this world.</span></li>
<li><span>He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and
the world knew him not.</span></li>
<li><span>He came unto his own, and his own received him
not.</span></li>
<li><span>But as many as received him, he gave them power to be
made the sons of God, to them that believe in his name.</span></li>
<li><span>Who are born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,
nor of the will of man, but of God.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we
saw his glory, the glory as it were of the only begotten of the
Father,) full of grace and truth.</span></li>
<li><span>John beareth witness of him, and crieth out, saying: This
was he of whom I spoke: He that shall come after me, is preferred
before me: because he was before me.</span></li>
<li><span>And of his fulness we all have received, and grace for
grace.</span></li>
<li><span>For the law was given by Moses; grace and truth came by
Jesus Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>No man hath seen God at any time: the only begotten Son
who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared
him.</span></li>
<li><span>And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent
from Jerusalem priests and Levites to him, to ask him: Who art
thou?</span></li>
<li><span>And he confessed, and did not deny: and he confessed: I
am not the Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>And they asked him: What then? Art thou Elias? And he
said: I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered:
No.</span></li>
<li><span>They said therefore unto him: Who art thou, that we may
give an answer to them that sent us? What sayest thou of
thyself?</span></li>
<li><span>He said: I am the voice of one crying out in the
wilderness, make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet
Isaias.</span></li>
<li><span>And they that were sent, were of the
Pharisees.</span></li>
<li><span>And they asked him, and said to him: Why then dost thou
baptize, if thou be not Christ, nor Elias, nor the
prophet?</span></li>
<li><span>John answered them, saying: I baptize with water; but
there hath stood one in the midst of you, whom you know
not.</span></li>
<li><span>The same is he that shall come after me, who is preferred
before me: the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to
loose.</span></li>
<li><span>These things were done in Bethania, beyond the Jordan,
where John was baptizing.</span></li>
<li><span>The next day, John saw Jesus coming to him, and he saith:
Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who taketh away the sin of the
world.</span></li>
<li><span>This is he, of whom I said: After me there cometh a man,
who is preferred before me: because he was before me.</span></li>
<li><span>And I knew him not, but that he may be made manifest in
Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</span></li>
<li><span>And John gave testimony, saying: I saw the Spirit coming
down, as a dove from heaven, and he remained upon him.</span></li>
<li><span>And I knew him not; but he who sent me to baptize with
water, said to me: He upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit
descending, and remaining upon him, he it is that baptizeth with
the Holy Ghost.</span></li>
<li><span>And I saw, and I gave testimony, that this is the Son of
God.</span></li>
<li><span>The next day again John stood, and two of his
disciples.</span></li>
<li><span>And beholding Jesus walking, he saith: Behold the Lamb of
God.</span></li>
<li><span>And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed
Jesus.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jesus turning, and seeing them following him, saith
to them: What seek you? Who said to him, Rabbi, (which is to say,
being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?</span></li>
<li><span>He saith to them: Come and see. They came, and saw where
he abode, and they stayed with him that day: now it was about the
tenth hour.</span></li>
<li><span>And Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the
two who had heard of John, and followed him.</span></li>
<li><span>He findeth first his brother Simon, and saith to him: We
have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the
Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>And he brought him to Jesus. And Jesus looking upon him,
said: Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas,
which is interpreted Peter.</span></li>
<li><span>On the following day, he would go forth into Galilee, and
he findeth Philip. And Jesus saith to him: Follow me.</span></li>
<li><span>Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and
Peter.</span></li>
<li><span>Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith to him: We have found
him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets did write, Jesus the
son of Joseph of Nazareth.</span></li>
<li><span>And Nathanael said to him: Can any thing of good come
from Nazareth? Philip saith to him: Come and see.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him: and he saith of him:
Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile.</span></li>
<li><span>Nathanael saith to him: Whence knowest thou me? Jesus
answered, and said to him: Before that Philip called thee, when
thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Nathanael answered him, and said: Rabbi, thou art the Son
of God, thou art the King of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered, and said to him: Because I said unto
thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, thou believest: greater things
than these shalt thou see.</span></li>
<li><span>And he saith to him: Amen, amen I say to you, you shall
see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and
descending upon the Son of man.</span></li>

<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="2">John 2</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And the third day, there was a marriage in Cana of
Galilee: and the mother of Jesus was there.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jesus also was invited, and his disciples, to the
marriage.</span></li>
<li><span>And the wine failing, the mother of Jesus saith to him:
They have no wine.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jesus saith to her: Woman, what is that to me and to
thee? my hour is not yet come.</span></li>
<li><span>His mother saith to the waiters: Whatsoever he shall say
to you, do ye.</span></li>
<li><span>Now there were set there six waterpots of stone,
according to the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing
two or three measures apiece.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus saith to them: Fill the waterpots with water. And
they filled them up to the brim.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jesus saith to them: Draw out now, and carry to the
chief steward of the feast. And they carried it.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the chief steward had tasted the water made
wine, and knew not whence it was, but the waiters knew who had
drawn the water; the chief steward calleth the
bridegroom,</span></li>
<li><span>And saith to him: Every man at first setteth forth good
wine, and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse. But
thou hast kept the good wine until now.</span></li>
<li><span>This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee;
and manifested his glory, and his disciples believed in
him.</span></li>
<li><span>After this he went down to Capharnaum, he and his mother,
and his brethren, and his disciples: and they remained there not
many days.</span></li>
<li><span>And the pasch of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up
to Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And he found in the temple them that sold oxen and sheep
and doves, and the changers of money sitting.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he had made, as it were, a scourge of little
cords, he drove them all out of the temple, the sheep also and the
oxen, and the money of the changers he poured out, and the tables
he overthrew.</span></li>
<li><span>And to them that sold doves he said: Take these things
hence, and make not the house of my Father a house of
traffic.</span></li>
<li><span>And his disciples remembered, that it was written: The
zeal of thy house hath eaten me up.</span></li>
<li><span>The Jews, therefore, answered, and said to him: What sign
dost thou shew unto us, seeing thou dost these things?</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered, and said to them: Destroy this temple,
and in three days I will raise it up.</span></li>
<li><span>The Jews then said: Six and forty years was this temple
in building; and wilt thou raise it up in three days?</span></li>
<li><span>But he spoke of the temple of his body.</span></li>
<li><span>When therefore he was risen again from the dead, his
disciples remembered, that he had said this, and they believed the
scripture, and the word that Jesus had said.</span></li>
<li><span>Now when he was at Jerusalem, at the pasch, upon the
festival day, many believed in his name, seeing his signs which he
did.</span></li>
<li><span>But Jesus did not trust himself unto them, for that he
knew all men,</span></li>
<li><span>And because he needed not that any should give testimony
of man: for he knew what was in man.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="3">John 3</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a
ruler of the Jews.</span></li>
<li><span>This man came to Jesus by night, and said to him: Rabbi,
we know that thou art come a teacher from God; for no man can do
these signs which thou dost, unless God be with him.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered, and said to him: Amen, amen I say to
thee, unless a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of
God.</span></li>
<li><span>Nicodemus saith to him: How can a man be born when he is
old? can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born
again?</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered: Amen, amen I say to thee, unless a man be
born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the
kingdom of God.</span></li>
<li><span>That which is born of the flesh, is flesh; and that which
is born of the Spirit, is spirit.</span></li>
<li><span>Wonder not, that I said to thee, you must be born
again.</span></li>
<li><span>The Spirit breatheth where he will; and thou hearest his
voice, but thou knowest not whence he cometh, and whither he goeth:
so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</span></li>
<li><span>Nicodemus answered, and said to him: How can these things
be done?</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered, and said to him: Art thou a master in
Israel, and knowest not these things?</span></li>
<li><span>Amen, amen I say to thee, that we speak what we know, and
we testify what we have seen, and you receive not our
testimony.</span></li>
<li><span>If I have spoken to you earthly things, and you believe
not; how will you believe, if I shall speak to you heavenly
things?</span></li>
<li><span>And no man hath ascended into heaven, but he that
descended from heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.</span></li>
<li><span>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must
the Son of man be lifted up:</span></li>
<li><span>That whosoever believeth in him, may not perish; but may
have life everlasting.</span></li>
<li><span>For God so loved the world, as to give his only begotten
Son; that whosoever believeth in him, may not perish, but may have
life everlasting.</span></li>
<li><span>For God sent not his Son into the world, to judge the
world, but that the world may be saved by him.</span></li>
<li><span>He that believeth in him is not judged. But he that doth
not believe, is already judged: because he believeth not in the
name of the only begotten Son of God.</span></li>
<li><span>And this is the judgment: because the light is come into
the world, and men loved darkness rather than the light: for their
works were evil.</span></li>
<li><span>For every one that doth evil hateth the light, and cometh
not to the light, that his works may not be reproved.</span></li>
<li><span>But he that doth truth, cometh to the light, that his
works may be made manifest, because they are done in
God.</span></li>
<li><span>After these things Jesus and his disciples came into the
land of Judea: and there he abode with them, and
baptized.</span></li>
<li><span>And John also was baptizing in Ennon near Salim; because
there was much water there; and they came and were
baptized.</span></li>
<li><span>For John was not yet cast into prison.</span></li>
<li><span>And there arose a question between some of John's
disciples and the Jews concerning purification:</span></li>
<li><span>And they came to John, and said to him: Rabbi, he that
was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou gavest testimony,
behold he baptizeth, and all men come to him.</span></li>
<li><span>John answered, and said: A man cannot receive any thing,
unless it be given him from heaven.</span></li>
<li><span>You yourselves do bear me witness, that I said, I am not
Christ, but that I am sent before him.</span></li>
<li><span>He that hath the bride, is the bridegroom: but the friend
of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth with joy
because of the bridegroom's voice. This my joy therefore is
fulfilled.</span></li>
<li><span>He must increase, but I must decrease.</span></li>
<li><span>He that cometh from above, is above all. He that is of
the earth, of the earth he is, and of the earth he speaketh. He
that cometh from heaven, is above all.</span></li>
<li><span>And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth: and
no man receiveth his testimony.</span></li>
<li><span>He that hath received his testimony, hath set to his seal
that God is true.</span></li>
<li><span>For he whom God hath sent, speaketh the words of God: for
God doth not give the Spirit by measure.</span></li>
<li><span>The Father loveth the Son: and he hath given all things
into his hand.</span></li>
<li><span>He that believeth in the Son, hath life everlasting; but
he that believeth not the Son, shall not see life; but the wrath of
God abideth on him.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="4">John 4</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>When Jesus therefore understood that the Pharisees had
heard that Jesus maketh more disciples, and baptizeth more than
John,</span></li>
<li><span>(Though Jesus himself did not baptize, but his
disciples,)</span></li>
<li><span>He left Judea, and went again into Galilee.</span></li>
<li><span>And he was of necessity to pass through
Samaria.</span></li>
<li><span>He cometh therefore to a city of Samaria, which is called
Sichar, near the land which Jacob gave to his son
Joseph.</span></li>
<li><span>Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore being wearied
with his journey, sat thus on the well. It was about the sixth
hour.</span></li>
<li><span>There cometh a woman of Samaria, to draw water. Jesus
saith to her: Give me to drink.</span></li>
<li><span>For his disciples were gone into the city to buy
meats.</span></li>
<li><span>Then that Samaritan woman saith to him: How dost thou,
being a Jew, ask of me to drink, who am a Samaritan woman? For the
Jews do not communicate with the Samaritans.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered, and said to her: If thou didst know the
gift of God, and who he is that saith to thee, Give me to drink;
thou perhaps wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given
thee living water.</span></li>
<li><span>The woman saith to him: Sir, thou hast nothing wherein to
draw, and the well is deep; from whence then hast thou living
water?</span></li>
<li><span>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the
well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his
cattle?</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered, and said to her: Whosoever drinketh of
this water, shall thirst again; but he that shall drink of the
water that I will give him, shall not thirst for ever:</span></li>
<li><span>But the water that I will give him, shall become in him a
fountain of water, springing up into life everlasting.</span></li>
<li><span>The woman saith to him: Sir, give me this water, that I
may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus saith to her: Go, call thy husband, and come
hither. 17 The woman answered, and said: I have no husband. Jesus
said to her: Thou hast said well, I have no husband:</span></li>
<li><span>For thou hast had five husbands: and he whom thou now
hast, is not thy husband. This thou hast said truly.</span></li>
<li><span>The woman saith to him: Sir, I perceive that thou art a
prophet.</span></li>
<li><span>Our fathers adored on this mountain, and you say, that at
Jerusalem is the place where men must adore.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus saith to her: Woman, believe me, that the hour
cometh, when you shall neither on this mountain, not in Jerusalem,
adore the Father.</span></li>
<li><span>You adore that which you know not: we adore that which we
know; for salvation is of the Jews.</span></li>
<li><span>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true adorers
shall adore the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father also
seeketh such to adore him.</span></li>
<li><span>God is a spirit; and they that adore him, must adore him
in spirit and in truth.</span></li>
<li><span>The woman saith to him: I know that the Messias cometh
(who is called Christ); therefore, when he is come, he will tell us
all things.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus saith to her: I am he, who am speaking with
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And immediately his disciples came; and they wondered
that he talked with the woman. Yet no man said: What seekest thou?
or, why talkest thou with her?</span></li>
<li><span>The woman therefore left her waterpot, and went her way
into the city, and saith to the men there:</span></li>
<li><span>Come, and see a man who has told me all things whatsoever
I have done. Is not he the Christ?</span></li>
<li><span>They went therefore out of the city, and came unto
him.</span></li>
<li><span>In the mean time the disciples prayed him, saying: Rabbi,
eat.</span></li>
<li><span>But he said to them: I have meat to eat, which you know
not.</span></li>
<li><span>The disciples therefore said one to another: Hath any man
brought him to eat?</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus saith to them: My meat is to do the will of him
that sent me, that I may perfect his work.</span></li>
<li><span>Do you not say, There are yet four months, and then the
harvest cometh? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes, and see
the countries; for they are white already to harvest.</span></li>
<li><span>And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit
unto life everlasting: that both he that soweth, and he that
reapeth, may rejoice together.</span></li>
<li><span>For in this is the saying true: That it is one man that
soweth, and it is another that reapeth.</span></li>
<li><span>I have sent you to reap that in which you did not labour:
others have laboured, and you have entered into their
labours.</span></li>
<li><span>Now of that city many of the Samaritans believed in him,
for the word of the woman giving testimony: He told me all things
whatsoever I have done.</span></li>
<li><span>So when the Samaritans were come to him, they desired
that he would tarry there. And he abode there two days.</span></li>
<li><span>And many more believed in him because of his own
word.</span></li>
<li><span>And they said to the woman: We now believe, not for thy
saying: for we ourselves have heard him, and know that this is
indeed the Saviour of the world.</span></li>
<li><span>Now after two days, he departed thence, and went into
Galilee.</span></li>
<li><span>For Jesus himself gave testimony that a prophet hath no
honour in his own country.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he was come into Galilee, the Galileans received
him, having seen all the things he had done at Jerusalem on the
festival day; for they also went to the festival day.</span></li>
<li><span>He came again therefore into Cana of Galilee, where he
made the water wine. And there was a certain ruler, whose son was
sick at Capharnaum.</span></li>
<li><span>He having heard that Jesus was come from Judea into
Galilee, went to him, and prayed him to come down, and heal his
son; for he was at the point of death.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus therefore said to him: Unless you see signs and
wonders, you believe not.</span></li>
<li><span>The ruler saith to him: Lord, come down before that my
son die.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus saith to him: Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man
believed the word which Jesus said to him, and went his
way.</span></li>
<li><span>And as he was going down, his servants met him; and they
brought word, saying, that his son lived.</span></li>
<li><span>He asked therefore of them the hour wherein he grew
better. And they said to him: Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the
fever left him.</span></li>
<li><span>The father therefore knew, that it was at the same hour
that Jesus said to him, Thy son liveth; and himself believed, and
his whole house.</span></li>
<li><span>This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he
was come out of Judea into Galilee.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="5">John 5</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>After these things was a festival day of the Jews, and
Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>Now there is at Jerusalem a pond, called Probatica, which
in Hebrew is named Bethsaida, having five porches.</span></li>
<li><span>In these lay a great multitude of sick, of blind, of
lame, of withered; waiting for the moving of the water.</span></li>
<li><span>And an angel of the Lord descended at certain times into
the pond; and the water was moved. And he that went down first into
the pond after the motion of the water, was made whole, of
whatsoever infirmity he lay under.</span></li>
<li><span>And there was a certain man there, that had been eight
and thirty years under his infirmity.</span></li>
<li><span>Him when Jesus had seen lying, and knew that he had been
now a long time, he saith to him: Wilt thou be made
whole?</span></li>
<li><span>The infirm man answered him: Sir, I have no man, when the
water is troubled, to put me into the pond. For whilst I am coming,
another goeth down before me.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus saith to him: Arise, take up thy bed, and
walk.</span></li>
<li><span>And immediately the man was made whole: and he took up
his bed, and walked. And it was the sabbath that day.</span></li>
<li><span>The Jews therefore said to him that was healed: It is the
sabbath; it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed.</span></li>
<li><span>He answered them: He that made me whole, he said to me,
Take up thy bed, and walk.</span></li>
<li><span>They asked him therefore: Who is that man who said to
thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?</span></li>
<li><span>But he who was healed, knew not who it was; for Jesus
went aside from the multitude standing in the place.</span></li>
<li><span>Afterwards, Jesus findeth him in the temple, and saith to
him: Behold thou art made whole: sin no more, lest some worse thing
happen to thee.</span></li>
<li><span>The man went his way, and told the Jews, that it was
Jesus who had made him whole.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, because he did
these things on the sabbath.</span></li>
<li><span>But Jesus answered them: My Father worketh until now; and
I work.</span></li>
<li><span>Hereupon therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him,
because he did not only break the sabbath, but also said God was
his Father, making himself equal to God.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Jesus answered, and said to them: Amen, amen, I say
unto you, the Son cannot do any thing of himself, but what he seeth
the Father doing: for what things soever he doth, these the Son
also doth in like manner.</span></li>
<li><span>For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things
which himself doth: and greater works than these will he shew him,
that you may wonder.</span></li>
<li><span>For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and giveth life:
so the Son also giveth life to whom he will.</span></li>
<li><span>For neither doth the Father judge any man, but hath given
all judgment to the Son.</span></li>
<li><span>That all men may honour the Son, as they honour the
Father. He who honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father, who
hath sent him.</span></li>
<li><span>Amen, amen I say unto you, that he who heareth my word,
and believeth him that sent me, hath life everlasting; and cometh
not into judgment, but is passed from death to life.</span></li>
<li><span>Amen, amen I say unto you, that the hour cometh, and now
is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they
that hear shall live.</span></li>
<li><span>For as the Father hath life in himself, so he hath given
the Son also to have life in himself:</span></li>
<li><span>And he hath given him power to do judgment, because he is
the Son of man.</span></li>
<li><span>Wonder not at this; for the hour cometh, wherein all that
are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of
God.</span></li>
<li><span>And they that have done good things, shall come forth
unto the resurrection of life; but they that have done evil, unto
the resurrection of judgment.</span></li>
<li><span>I cannot of myself do any thing. As I hear, so I judge:
and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the
will of him that sent me.</span></li>
<li><span>If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not
true.</span></li>
<li><span>There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know
that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.</span></li>
<li><span>You sent to John, and he gave testimony to the
truth.</span></li>
<li><span>But I receive not testimony from man: but I say these
things, that you may be saved.</span></li>
<li><span>He was a burning and a shining light: and you were
willing for a time to rejoice in his light.</span></li>
<li><span>But I have a greater testimony than that of John: for the
works which the Father hath given me to perfect; the works
themselves, which I do, give testimony of me, that the Father hath
sent me.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Father himself who hath sent me, hath given
testimony of me: neither have you heard his voice at any time, nor
seen his shape.</span></li>
<li><span>And you have not his word abiding in you: for whom he
hath sent, him you believe not.</span></li>
<li><span>Search the scriptures, for you think in them to have life
everlasting; and the same are they that give testimony of
me.</span></li>
<li><span>And you will not come to me that you may have
life.</span></li>
<li><span>I receive glory not from men.</span></li>
<li><span>But I know you, that you have not the love of God in
you.</span></li>
<li><span>I am come in the name of my Father, and you receive me
not: if another shall come in his own name, him you will
receive.</span></li>
<li><span>How can you believe, who receive glory one from another:
and the glory which is from God alone, you do not seek?</span></li>
<li><span>Think not that I will accuse you to the Father. There is
one that accuseth you, Moses, in whom you trust.</span></li>
<li><span>For if you did believe Moses, you would perhaps believe
me also; for he wrote of me.</span></li>
<li><span>But if you do not believe his writings, how will you
believe my words?</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee,
which is that of Tiberias.</span></li>
<li><span>And a great multitude followed him, because they saw the
miracles which he did on them that were diseased.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus therefore went up into a mountain, and there he sat
with his disciples.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the pasch, the festival day of the Jews, was near at
hand.</span></li>
<li><span>When Jesus therefore had lifted up his eyes, and seen
that a very great multitude cometh to him, he said to Philip:
Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?</span></li>
<li><span>And this he said to try him; for he himself knew what he
would do.</span></li>
<li><span>Philip answered him: Two hundred pennyworth of bread is
not sufficient for them, that every one may take a
little.</span></li>
<li><span>One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter,
saith to him:</span></li>
<li><span>There is a boy here that hath five barley loaves, and two
fishes; but what are these among so many?</span></li>
<li><span>Then Jesus said: Make the men sit down. Now there was
much grass in the place. The men therefore sat down, in number
about five thousand.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jesus took the loaves: and when he had given thanks,
he distributed to them that were set down. In like manner also of
the fishes, as much as they would.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they were filled, he said to his disciples:
Gather up the fragments that remain, lest they be lost.</span></li>
<li><span>They gathered up therefore, and filled twelve baskets
with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over
and above to them that had eaten.</span></li>
<li><span>Now those men, when they had seen what a miracle Jesus
had done, said: This is of a truth the prophet, that is to come
into the world.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus therefore, when he knew that they would come to
take him by force, and make him king, fled again into the mountain
himself alone.</span></li>
<li><span>And when evening was come, his disciples went down to the
sea.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they had gone up into a ship, they went over the
sea to Capharnaum; and it was now dark, and Jesus was not come unto
them.</span></li>
<li><span>And the sea arose, by reason of a great wind that
blew.</span></li>
<li><span>When they had rowed therefore about five and twenty or
thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking upon the sea, and drawing
nigh to the ship, and they were afraid.</span></li>
<li><span>But he saith to them: It is I; be not afraid.</span></li>
<li><span>They were willing therefore to take him into the ship;
and presently the ship was at the land to which they were
going.</span></li>
<li><span>The next day, the multitude that stood on the other side
of the sea, saw that there was no other ship there but one, and
that Jesus had not entered into the ship with his disciples, but
that his disciples were gone away alone.</span></li>
<li><span>But other ships came in from Tiberias; nigh unto the
place where they had eaten the bread, the Lord giving
thanks.</span></li>
<li><span>When therefore the multitude saw that Jesus was not
there, nor his disciples, they took shipping, and came to
Capharnaum, seeking for Jesus.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they had found him on the other side of the sea,
they said to him: Rabbi, when camest thou hither?</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered them, and said: Amen, amen I say to you,
you seek me, not because you have seen miracles, but because you
did eat of the loaves, and were filled.</span></li>
<li><span>Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that
which endureth unto life everlasting, which the Son of man will
give you. For him hath God, the Father, sealed.</span></li>
<li><span>They said therefore unto him: What shall we do, that we
may work the works of God?</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered, and said to them: This is the work of
God, that you believe in him whom he hath sent.</span></li>
<li><span>They said therefore to him: What sign therefore dost thou
shew, that we may see, and may believe thee? What dost thou
work?</span></li>
<li><span>Our fathers did eat manna in the desert, as it is
written: He gave them bread from heaven to eat.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Jesus said to them: Amen, amen I say to you; Moses
gave you not bread from heaven, but my Father giveth you the true
bread from heaven.</span></li>
<li><span>For the bread of God is that which cometh down from
heaven, and giveth life to the world.</span></li>
<li><span>They said therefore unto him: Lord, give us always this
bread.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jesus said to them: I am the bread of life: he that
cometh to me shall not hunger: and he that believeth in me shall
never thirst.</span></li>
<li><span>But I said unto you, that you also have seen me, and you
believe not.</span></li>
<li><span>All that the Father giveth to me shall come to me; and
him that cometh to me, I will not cast out.</span></li>
<li><span>Because I came down from heaven, not to do my own will,
but the will of him that sent me.</span></li>
<li><span>Now this is the will of the Father who sent me: that of
all that he hath given me, I should lose nothing; but should raise
it up again in the last day.</span></li>
<li><span>And this is the will of my Father that sent me: that
every one who seeth the Son, and believeth in him, may have life
everlasting, and I will raise him up in the last day.</span></li>
<li><span>The Jews therefore murmured at him, because he had said:
I am the living bread which came down from heaven.</span></li>
<li><span>And they said: Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph,
whose father and mother we know? How then saith he, I came down
from heaven?</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus therefore answered, and said to them: Murmur not
among yourselves.</span></li>
<li><span>No man can come to me, except the Father, who hath sent
me, draw him; and I will raise him up in the last day.</span></li>
<li><span>It is written in the prophets: And they shall all be
taught of God. Every one that hath heard of the Father, and hath
learned, cometh to me.</span></li>
<li><span>Not that any man hath seen the Father; but he who is of
God, he hath seen the Father.</span></li>
<li><span>Amen, amen I say unto you: He that believeth in me, hath
everlasting life.</span></li>
<li><span>I am the bread of life.</span></li>
<li><span>Your fathers did eat manna in the desert, and are
dead.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the bread which cometh down from heaven; that if
any man eat of it, he may not die.</span></li>
<li><span>I am the living bread which came down from
heaven.</span></li>
<li><span>If any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever; and
the bread that I will give, is my flesh, for the life of the
world.</span></li>
<li><span>The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying: How
can this man give us his flesh to eat?</span></li>
<li><span>Then Jesus said to them: Amen, amen I say unto you:
Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood,
you shall not have life in you.</span></li>
<li><span>He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath
everlasting life: and I will raise him up in the last
day.</span></li>
<li><span>For my flesh is meat indeed: and my blood is drink
indeed.</span></li>
<li><span>He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, abideth
in me, and I in him.</span></li>
<li><span>As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the
Father; so he that eateth me, the same also shall live by
me.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the bread that came down from heaven. Not as your
fathers did eat manna, and are dead. He that eateth this bread,
shall live for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>These things he said, teaching in the synagogue, in
Capharnaum.</span></li>
<li><span>Many therefore of his disciples, hearing it, said: This
saying is hard, and who can hear it?</span></li>
<li><span>But Jesus, knowing in himself, that his disciples
murmured at this, said to them: Doth this scandalize
you?</span></li>
<li><span>If then you shall see the Son of man ascend up where he
was before?</span></li>
<li><span>It is the spirit that quickeneth: the flesh profiteth
nothing. The words that I have spoken to you, are spirit and
life.</span></li>
<li><span>But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus
knew from the beginning, who they were that did not believe, and
who he was, that would betray him.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said: Therefore did I say to you, that no man can
come to me, unless it be given him by my Father.</span></li>
<li><span>After this many of his disciples went back; and walked no
more with him.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Jesus said to the twelve: Will you also go
away?</span></li>
<li><span>And Simon Peter answered him: Lord, to whom shall we go?
thou hast the words of eternal life.</span></li>
<li><span>And we have believed and have known, that thou art the
Christ, the Son of God.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered them: Have not I chosen you twelve; and
one of you is a devil?</span></li>
<li><span>Now he meant Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon: for this
same was about to betray him, whereas he was one of the
twelve.</span></li>

<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="7">John 7</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>After these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for he would
not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at
hand.</span></li>
<li><span>And his brethren said to him: Pass from hence, and go
into Judea; that thy disciples also may see thy works which thou
dost.</span></li>
<li><span>For there is no man that doth any thing in secret, and he
himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things,
manifest thyself to the world.</span></li>
<li><span>For neither did his brethren believe in him.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Jesus said to them: My time is not yet come; but
your time is always ready.</span></li>
<li><span>The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth: because I
give testimony of it, that the works thereof are evil.</span></li>
<li><span>Go you up to this festival day, but I go not up to this
festival day: because my time is not accomplished.</span></li>
<li><span>When he had said these things, he himself stayed in
Galilee.</span></li>
<li><span>But after his brethren were gone up, then he also went up
to the feast, not openly, but, as it were, in secret.</span></li>
<li><span>The Jews therefore sought him on the festival day, and
said: Where is he?</span></li>
<li><span>And there was much murmuring among the multitude
concerning him. For some said: He is a good man. And others said:
No, but he seduceth the people.</span></li>
<li><span>Yet no man spoke openly of him, for fear of the
Jews.</span></li>
<li><span>Now about the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the
temple, and taught.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Jews wondered, saying: How doth this man know
letters, having never learned?</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered them, and said: My doctrine is not mine,
but his that sent me.</span></li>
<li><span>If any man do the will of him; he shall know of the
doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of
myself.</span></li>
<li><span>He that speaketh of himself, seeketh his own glory: but
he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, he is true, and
there is no injustice in him.</span></li>
<li><span>Did Moses not give you the law, and yet none of you
keepeth the law?</span></li>
<li><span>Why seek you to kill me? The multitude answered, and
said: Thou hast a devil; who seeketh to kill thee?</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered, and said to them: One work I have done;
and you all wonder:</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore, Moses gave you circumcision (not because it is
of Moses, but of the fathers;) and on the sabbath day you
circumcise a man.</span></li>
<li><span>If a man receive circumcision on the sabbath day, that
the law of Moses may not be broken; are you angry at me because I
have healed the whole man on the sabbath day?</span></li>
<li><span>Judge not according to the appearance, but judge just
judgment.</span></li>
<li><span>Some therefore of Jerusalem said: Is not this he whom
they seek to kill?</span></li>
<li><span>And behold, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing to
him. Have the rulers known for a truth, that this is the
Christ?</span></li>
<li><span>But we know this man, whence he is: but when the Christ
cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching, and
saying: You both know me, and you know whence I am: and I am not
come of myself; but he that sent me, is true, whom you know
not.</span></li>
<li><span>I know him, because I am from him, and he hath sent
me.</span></li>
<li><span>They sought therefore to apprehend him: and no man laid
hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</span></li>
<li><span>But of the people many believed in him, and said: When
the Christ cometh, shall he do more miracles, than these which this
man doth?</span></li>
<li><span>The Pharisees heard the people murmuring these things
concerning him: and the rulers and Pharisees sent ministers to
apprehend him.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus therefore said to them: Yet a little while I am
with you: and then I go to him that sent me.</span></li>
<li><span>You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am,
thither you cannot come.</span></li>
<li><span>The Jews therefore said among themselves: Whither will he
go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among
the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</span></li>
<li><span>What is this saying that he hath said: You shall seek me,
and shall not find me; and where I am, you cannot come?</span></li>
<li><span>And on the last, and great day of the festivity, Jesus
stood and cried, saying: If any man thirst, let him come to me, and
drink.</span></li>
<li><span>He that believeth in me, as the scripture saith, Out of
his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</span></li>
<li><span>Now this he said of the Spirit which they should receive,
who believed in him: for as yet the Spirit was not given, because
Jesus was not yet glorified.</span></li>
<li><span>Of that multitude therefore, when they had heard these
words of his, some said: This is the prophet indeed.</span></li>
<li><span>Others said: This is the Christ. But some said: Doth the
Christ come out of Galilee?</span></li>
<li><span>Doth not the scripture say: That Christ cometh of the
seed of David, and from Bethlehem the town where David
was?</span></li>
<li><span>So there arose a dissension among the people because of
him.</span></li>
<li><span>And some of them would have apprehended him: but no man
laid hands on him.</span></li>
<li><span>The ministers therefore came to the chief priests and the
Pharisees. And they said to them: Why have you not brought
him?</span></li>
<li><span>The ministers answered: Never did man speak like this
man.</span></li>
<li><span>The Pharisees therefore answered them: Are you also
seduced?</span></li>
<li><span>Hath any one of the rulers believed in him, or of the
Pharisees?</span></li>
<li><span>But this multitude, that knoweth not the law, are
accursed.</span></li>
<li><span>Nicodemus said to them, (he that came to him by night,
who was one of them:)</span></li>
<li><span>Doth our law judge any man, unless it first hear him, and
know what he doth?</span></li>
<li><span>They answered, and said to him: Art thou also a Galilean?
Search the scriptures, and see, that out of Galilee a prophet
riseth not.</span></li>
<li><span>And every man returned to his own house.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="8">John 8</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And Jesus went unto mount Olivet.</span></li>
<li><span>And early in the morning he came again into the temple,
and all the people came to him, and sitting down he taught
them.</span></li>
<li><span>And the scribes and the Pharisees bring unto him a woman
taken in adultery: and they set her in the midst,</span></li>
<li><span>And said to him: Master, this woman was even now taken in
adultery.</span></li>
<li><span>Now Moses in the law commanded us to stone such a one.
But what sayest thou?</span></li>
<li><span>And this they said tempting him, that they might accuse
him. But Jesus bowing himself down, wrote with his finger on the
ground.</span></li>
<li><span>When therefore they continued asking him, he lifted up
himself, and said to them: He that is without sin among you, let
him first cast a stone at her.</span></li>
<li><span>And again stooping down, he wrote on the
ground.</span></li>
<li><span>But they hearing this, went out one by one, beginning at
the eldest. And Jesus alone remained, and the woman standing in the
midst.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Jesus lifting up himself, said to her: Woman, where
are they that accused thee? Hath no man condemned thee?</span></li>
<li><span>Who said: No man, Lord. And Jesus said: Neither will I
condemn thee. Go, and now sin no more.</span></li>
<li><span>Again therefore, Jesus spoke to them, saying: I am the
light of the world: he that followeth me, walketh not in darkness,
but shall have the light of life.</span></li>
<li><span>The Pharisees therefore said to him: Thou givest
testimony of thyself: thy testimony is not true.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered, and said to them: Although I give
testimony of myself, my testimony is true: for I know whence I
came, and whither I go: but you know not whence I come, or whither
I go.</span></li>
<li><span>You judge according to the flesh: I judge not any
man.</span></li>
<li><span>And if I do judge, my judgment is true: because I am not
alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</span></li>
<li><span>And in your law it is written, that the testimony of two
men is true.</span></li>
<li><span>I am one that give testimony of myself: and the Father
that sent me giveth testimony of me.</span></li>
<li><span>They said therefore to him: Where is thy Father? Jesus
answered: Neither me do you know, nor my Father: if you did know
me, perhaps you would know my Father also.</span></li>
<li><span>These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, teaching in the
temple: and no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet
come.</span></li>
<li><span>Again therefore Jesus said to them: I go, and you shall
seek me, and you shall die in your sin. Whither I go, you cannot
come.</span></li>
<li><span>The Jews therefore said: Will he kill himself, because he
said: Whither I go, you cannot come?</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to them: You are from beneath, I am from
above. You are of this world, I am not of this world.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore I said to you, that you shall die in your sins.
For if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your
sin.</span></li>
<li><span>They said therefore to him: Who art thou? Jesus said to
them: The beginning, who also speak unto you.</span></li>
<li><span>Many things I have to speak and to judge of you. But he
that sent me, is true: and the things I have heard of him, these
same I speak in the world.</span></li>
<li><span>And they understood not, that he called God his
Father.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus therefore said to them: When you shall have lifted
up the Son of man, then shall you know, that I am he, and that I do
nothing of myself, but as the Father hath taught me, these things I
speak:</span></li>
<li><span>And he that sent me, is with me, and he hath not left me
alone: for I do always the things that please him.</span></li>
<li><span>When he spoke these things, many believed in
him.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Jesus said to those Jews, who believed him: If you
continue in my word, you shall be my disciples indeed.</span></li>
<li><span>And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make
you free.</span></li>
<li><span>They answered him: We are the seed of Abraham, and we
have never been slaves to any man: how sayest thou: you shall be
free?</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered them: Amen, amen I say unto you: that
whosoever committeth sin, is the servant of sin.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the servant abideth not in the house for ever; but
the son abideth for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>If therefore the son shall make you free, you shall be
free indeed.</span></li>
<li><span>I know that you are the children of Abraham: but you seek
to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</span></li>
<li><span>I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and you do
the things that you have seen with your father.</span></li>
<li><span>They answered, and said to him: Abraham is our father.
Jesus saith to them: If you be the children of Abraham, do the
works of Abraham.</span></li>
<li><span>But now you seek to kill me, a man who have spoken the
truth to you, which I have heard of God. This Abraham did
not.</span></li>
<li><span>You do the works of your father. They said therefore to
him: We are not born of fornication: we have one Father, even
God.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus therefore said to them: If God were your Father,
you would indeed love me. For from God I proceeded, and came; for I
came not of myself, but he sent me:</span></li>
<li><span>Why do you not know my speech? Because you cannot hear my
word.</span></li>
<li><span>You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your
father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and he
stood not in the truth; because truth is not in him. When he
speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the
father thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>But if I say the truth, you believe me not.</span></li>
<li><span>Which of you shall convince me of sin? If I say the truth
to you, why do you not believe me?</span></li>
<li><span>He that is of God, heareth the words of God. Therefore
you hear them not, because you are not of God.</span></li>
<li><span>The Jews therefore answered, and said to him: Do not we
say well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered: I have not a devil: but I honour my
Father, and you have dishonoured me.</span></li>
<li><span>But I seek not my own glory: there is one that seeketh
and judgeth.</span></li>
<li><span>Amen, amen I say to you: If any man keep my word, he
shall not see death for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>The Jews therefore said: Now we know that thou hast a
devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest: If any
man keep my word, he shall not taste death for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who is dead?
and the prophets are dead. Whom dost thou make thyself?</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered: If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing.
It is my Father that glorifieth me, of whom you say that he is your
God.</span></li>
<li><span>And you have not known him, but I know him. And if I
shall say that I know him not, I shall be like to you, a liar. But
I do know him, and do keep his word.</span></li>
<li><span>Abraham your father rejoiced that he might see my day: he
saw it, and was glad.</span></li>
<li><span>The Jews therefore said to him: Thou art not yet fifty
years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus said to them: Amen, amen I say to you, before
Abraham was made, I am.</span></li>
<li><span>They took up stones therefore to cast at him. But Jesus
hid himself, and went out of the temple.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>And Jesus passing by, saw a man, who was blind from his
birth:</span></li>
<li><span>And his disciples asked him: Rabbi, who hath sinned, this
man, or his parents, that he should be born blind?</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered: Neither hath this man sinned, nor his
parents; but that the works of God should be made manifest in
him.</span></li>
<li><span>I must work the works of him that sent me, whilst it is
day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</span></li>
<li><span>As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the
world.</span></li>
<li><span>When he had said these things, he spat on the ground, and
made clay of the spittle, and spread the clay on his
eyes,</span></li>
<li><span>And said to him: Go, wash in the pool of Siloe, which is
interpreted, Sent. He went therefore, and washed, and he came
seeing.</span></li>
<li><span>The neighbours therefore, and they who had seen him
before that he was a beggar, said: Is not this he that sat and
begged? Some said: This is he.</span></li>
<li><span>But others said: No, but he is like him. But he said: I
am he.</span></li>
<li><span>They said therefore to him: How were thy eyes
opened?</span></li>
<li><span>He answered: That man that is called Jesus made clay, and
anointed my eyes, and said to me: Go to the pool of Siloe, and
wash. And I went, I washed, and I see.</span></li>
<li><span>And they said to him: Where is he? He saith: I know
not.</span></li>
<li><span>They bring him that had been blind to the
Pharisees.</span></li>
<li><span>Now it was the sabbath, when Jesus made the clay, and
opened his eyes.</span></li>
<li><span>Again therefore the Pharisees asked him, how he had
received his sight. But he said to them: He put clay upon my eyes,
and I washed, and I see.</span></li>
<li><span>Some therefore of the Pharisees said: This man is not of
God, who keepeth not the sabbath. But others said: How can a man
that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among
them.</span></li>
<li><span>They say therefore to the blind man again: What sayest
thou of him that hath opened they eyes? And he said: He is a
prophet.</span></li>
<li><span>The Jews then did not believe concerning him, that he had
been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the
parents of him that had received his sight,</span></li>
<li><span>And asked them, saying: Is this your son, who you say was
born blind? How then doth he now see?</span></li>
<li><span>His parents answered them, and said: We know that this is
our son, and that he was born blind:</span></li>
<li><span>But how he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his
eyes, we know not: ask himself: he is of age, let him speak for
himself.</span></li>
<li><span>These things his parents said, because they feared the
Jews: for the Jews had already agreed among themselves, that if any
man should confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the
synagogue.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore did his parents say: He is of age, ask
himself.</span></li>
<li><span>They therefore called the man again that had been blind,
and said to him: Give glory to God. We know that this man is a
sinner.</span></li>
<li><span>He said therefore to them: If he be a sinner, I know not:
one thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see.</span></li>
<li><span>They said then to him: What did he to thee? How did he
open thy eyes?</span></li>
<li><span>He answered them: I have told you already, and you have
heard: why would you hear it again? will you also become his
disciples?</span></li>
<li><span>They reviled him therefore, and said: Be thou his
disciple; but we are the disciples of Moses.</span></li>
<li><span>We know that God spoke to Moses: but as to this man, we
know not from whence he is.</span></li>
<li><span>The man answered, and said to them: Why, herein is a
wonderful thing, that you know not from whence he is, and he hath
opened my eyes.</span></li>
<li><span>Now we know that God doth not hear sinners: but if a man
be a server of God, and doth his will, him he heareth.</span></li>
<li><span>From the beginning of the world it hath not been heard,
that any man hath opened the eyes of one born blind.</span></li>
<li><span>Unless this man were of God, he could not do any
thing.</span></li>
<li><span>They answered, and said to him: Thou wast wholly born in
sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus heard that they had cast him out: and when he had
found him, he said to him: Dost thou believe in the Son of
God?</span></li>
<li><span>He answered, and said: Who is he, Lord, that I may
believe in him?</span></li>
<li><span>And Jesus said to him: Thou hast both seen him; and it is
he that talketh with thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said: I believe, Lord. And falling down, he adored
him.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jesus said: For judgment I am come into this world;
that they who see not, may see; and they who see, may become
blind.</span></li>
<li><span>And some of the Pharisees, who were with him, heard: and
they said unto him: Are we also blind?</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus said to them: If you were blind, you should not
have sin: but now you say: We see. Your sin remaineth.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>Amen, amen I say to you: He that entereth not by the door
into the sheepfold, but climbeth up another way, the same is a
thief and a robber.</span></li>
<li><span>But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of
the sheep.</span></li>
<li><span>To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice:
and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them
out.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he hath let out his own sheep, he goeth before
them: and the sheep follow him, because they know his
voice.</span></li>
<li><span>But a stranger they follow not, but fly from him, because
they know not the voice of strangers.</span></li>
<li><span>This proverb Jesus spoke to them. But they understood not
what he spoke to them.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus therefore said to them again: Amen, amen I say to
you, I am the door of the sheep.</span></li>
<li><span>All others, as many as have come, are thieves and
robbers: and the sheep heard them not.</span></li>
<li><span>I am the door. By me, if any man enter in, he shall be
saved: and he shall go in, and go out, and shall find
pastures.</span></li>
<li><span>The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and
to destroy. I am come that they may have life, and may have it more
abundantly.</span></li>
<li><span>I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd giveth his life
for his sheep.</span></li>
<li><span>But the hireling, and he that is not the shepherd, whose
own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the
sheep, and flieth: and the wolf catcheth, and scattereth the
sheep:</span></li>
<li><span>And the hireling flieth, because he is a hireling: and he
hath no care for the sheep.</span></li>
<li><span>I am the good shepherd; and I know mine, and mine know
me.</span></li>
<li><span>As the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father: and I
lay down my life for my sheep.</span></li>
<li><span>And other sheep I have, that are not of this fold: them
also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice, and there shall be
one fold and one shepherd.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore doth the Father love me: because I lay down my
life, that I may take it again.</span></li>
<li><span>No man taketh it away from me: but I lay it down of
myself, and I have power to lay it down: and I have power to take
it up again. This commandment have I received of my
Father.</span></li>
<li><span>A dissension rose again among the Jews for these
words.</span></li>
<li><span>And many of them said: He hath a devil, and is mad: why
hear you him?</span></li>
<li><span>Others said: These are not the words of one that hath a
devil: Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</span></li>
<li><span>And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem: and
it was winter.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomon's
porch.</span></li>
<li><span>The Jews therefore came round about him, and said to him:
How long dost thou hold our souls in suspense? If thou be the
Christ, tell us plainly.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered them: I speak to you, and you believe not:
the works that I do in the name of my Father, they give testimony
of me.</span></li>
<li><span>But you do not believe, because you are not of my
sheep.</span></li>
<li><span>My sheep hear my voice: and I know them, and they follow
me.</span></li>
<li><span>And I give them life everlasting; and they shall not
perish for ever, and no man shall pluck them out of my
hand.</span></li>
<li><span>That which my Father hath given me, is greater than all:
and no one can snatch them out of the hand of my
Father.</span></li>
<li><span>I and the Father are one.</span></li>
<li><span>The Jews then took up stones to stone him.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered them: Many good works I have shewed you
from my Father; for which of these works do you stone
me?</span></li>
<li><span>The Jews answered him: For a good work we stone thee not,
but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, maketh
thyself God.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered them: Is it not written in your law: I
said you are gods?</span></li>
<li><span>If he called them gods, to whom to word of God was
spoken, and the scripture cannot be broken;</span></li>
<li><span>Do you say of him whom the Father hath sanctified and
sent into the world: Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son
of God?</span></li>
<li><span>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me
not.</span></li>
<li><span>But if I do, though you will not believe me, believe the
works: that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and
I in the Father.</span></li>
<li><span>They sought therefore to take him; and he escaped out of
their hands.</span></li>
<li><span>And he went again beyond the Jordan, into that place
where John was baptizing first; and there he abode.</span></li>
<li><span>And many resorted to him, and they said: John indeed did
no sign.</span></li>
<li><span>But all things whatsoever John said of this man, were
true. And many believed in him.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>Now there was a certain man sick, named Lazarus, of
Bethania, of the town of Mary and Martha her sister.</span></li>
<li><span>(And Mary was she that anointed the Lord with ointment,
and wiped his feet with her hair: whose brother Lazarus was
sick.)</span></li>
<li><span>His sisters therefore sent to him, saying: Lord, behold,
he whom thou lovest is sick.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jesus hearing it, said to them: This sickness is not
unto death, but for the glory of God: that the Son of God may be
glorified by it.</span></li>
<li><span>Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister Mary, and
Lazarus.</span></li>
<li><span>When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he still
remained in the same place two days.</span></li>
<li><span>Then after that, he said to his disciples: Let us go into
Judea again.</span></li>
<li><span>The disciples say to him: Rabbi, the Jews but now sought
to stone thee: and goest thou thither again?</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered: Are there not twelve hours of the day? If
a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light
of this world:</span></li>
<li><span>But if he walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the
light is not in him.</span></li>
<li><span>These things he said; and after that he said to them:
Lazarus our friend sleepeth; but I go that I may awake him out of
sleep.</span></li>
<li><span>His disciples therefore said: Lord, if he sleep, he shall
do well.</span></li>
<li><span>But Jesus spoke of his death; and they thought that he
spoke of the repose of sleep.</span></li>
<li><span>Then therefore Jesus said to them plainly: Lazarus is
dead.</span></li>
<li><span>And I am glad, for your sakes, that I was not there, that
you may believe: but let us go to him.</span></li>
<li><span>Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to his
fellow disciples: Let us also go, that we may die with
him.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus therefore came, and found that he had been four
days already in the grave.</span></li>
<li><span>(Now Bethania was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs
off.)</span></li>
<li><span>And many of the Jews were come to Martha and Mary, to
comfort them concerning their brother.</span></li>
<li><span>Martha therefore, as soon as she heard that Jesus had
come, went to meet him: but Mary sat at home.</span></li>
<li><span>Martha therefore said to Jesus: Lord, if thou hadst been
here, my brother had not died.</span></li>
<li><span>But now also I know that whatsoever thou wilt ask of God,
God will give it thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus saith to her: Thy brother shall rise
again.</span></li>
<li><span>Martha saith to him: I know that he shall rise again, in
the resurrection at the last day.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus said to her: I am the resurrection and the life: he
that believeth in me, although he be dead, shall live:</span></li>
<li><span>And every one that liveth, and believeth in me, shall not
die for ever. Believest thou this?</span></li>
<li><span>She saith to him: Yea, Lord, I have believed that thou
art Christ the Son of the living God, who art come into this
world.</span></li>
<li><span>And when she had said these things, she went, and called
her sister Mary secretly, saying: The master is come, and calleth
for thee.</span></li>
<li><span>She, as soon as she heard this, riseth quickly, and
cometh to him.</span></li>
<li><span>For Jesus was not yet come into the town: but he was
still in that place where Martha had met him.</span></li>
<li><span>The Jews therefore, who were with her in the house, and
comforted her, when they saw Mary that she rose up speedily and
went out, followed her, saying: She goeth to the grave to weep
there.</span></li>
<li><span>When Mary therefore was come where Jesus was, seeing him,
she fell down at his feet, and saith to him: Lord, if thou hadst
been here, my brother had not died.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews
that were come with her, weeping, groaned in the spirit, and
troubled himself,</span></li>
<li><span>And said: Where have you laid him? They say to him: Lord,
come and see.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jesus wept.</span></li>
<li><span>The Jews therefore said: Behold how he loved
him.</span></li>
<li><span>But some of them said: Could not he that opened the eyes
of the man born blind, have caused that this man should not
die?</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus therefore again groaning in himself, cometh to the
sepulchre. Now it was a cave; and a stone was laid over
it.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus saith: Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of
him that was dead, saith to him: Lord, by this time he stinketh,
for he is now of four days.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus saith to her: Did not I say to thee, that if thou
believe, thou shalt see the glory of God?</span></li>
<li><span>They took therefore the stone away. And Jesus lifting up
his eyes said: Father, I give thee thanks that thou hast heard
me.</span></li>
<li><span>And I knew that thou hearest me always; but because of
the people who stand about have I said it, that they may believe
that thou hast sent me.</span></li>
<li><span>When he had said these things, he cried with a loud
voice: Lazarus, come forth.</span></li>
<li><span>And presently he that had been dead came forth, bound
feet and hands with winding bands; and his face was bound about
with a napkin. Jesus said to them: Loose him, and let him
go.</span></li>
<li><span>Many therefore of the Jews, who were come to Mary and
Martha, and had seen the things that Jesus did, believed in
him.</span></li>
<li><span>But some of them went to the Pharisees, and told them the
things that Jesus had done.</span></li>
<li><span>The chief priests therefore, and the Pharisees, gathered
a council, and said: What do we, for this man doth many
miracles?</span></li>
<li><span>If we let him alone so, all will believe in him; and the
Romans will come, and take away our place and nation.</span></li>
<li><span>But one of them, named Caiphas, being the high priest
that year, said to them: You know nothing.</span></li>
<li><span>Neither do you consider that it is expedient for you that
one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish
not.</span></li>
<li><span>And this he spoke not of himself: but being the high
priest of that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the
nation.</span></li>
<li><span>And not only for the nation, but to gather together in
one the children of God, that were dispersed.</span></li>
<li><span>From that day therefore they devised to put him to
death.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore Jesus walked no more openly among the Jews; but
he went into a country near the desert, unto a city that is called
Ephrem, and there he abode with his disciples.</span></li>
<li><span>And the pasch of the Jews was at hand; and many from the
country went up to Jerusalem, before the pasch to purify
themselves.</span></li>
<li><span>They sought therefore for Jesus; and they discoursed one
with another, standing in the temple: What think you that he is not
come to the festival day? And the chief priests and Pharisees had
given a commandment, that if any man knew where he was, he should
tell, that they might apprehend him.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="12">John 12</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Jesus therefore, six days before the pasch, came to
Bethania, where Lazarus had been dead, whom Jesus raised to
life.</span></li>
<li><span>And they made him a supper there: and Martha served: but
Lazarus was one of them that were at table with him.</span></li>
<li><span>Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of right
spikenard, of great price, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and
wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the
odour of the ointment.</span></li>
<li><span>Then one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, he that was
about to betray him, said:</span></li>
<li><span>Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence,
and given to the poor?</span></li>
<li><span>Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor; but
because he was a thief, and having the purse, carried the things
that were put therein.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus therefore said: Let her alone, that she may keep it
against the day of my burial.</span></li>
<li><span>For the poor you have always with you; but me you have
not always.</span></li>
<li><span>A great multitude therefore of the Jews knew that he was
there; and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might
see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.</span></li>
<li><span>But the chief priests thought to kill Lazarus
also:</span></li>
<li><span>Because many of the Jews, by reason of him, went away,
and believed in Jesus.</span></li>
<li><span>And on the next day, a great multitude that was to come
to the festival day, when they had heard that Jesus was coming to
Jerusalem,</span></li>
<li><span>Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him,
and cried: Hosanna, blessed is he that cometh in the name of the
Lord, the king of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jesus found a young ass, and sat upon it, as it is
written:</span></li>
<li><span>Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy king cometh,
sitting on an ass's colt.</span></li>
<li><span>These things his disciples did not know at the first; but
when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things
were written of him, and that they had done these things to
him.</span></li>
<li><span>The multitude therefore gave testimony, which was with
him, when he called Lazarus out of the grave, and raised him from
the dead.</span></li>
<li><span>For which reason also the people came to meet him,
because they heard that he had done this miracle.</span></li>
<li><span>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves: Do you see
that we prevail nothing? behold, the whole world is gone after
him.</span></li>
<li><span>Now there were certain Gentiles among them, who came up
to adore on the festival day.</span></li>
<li><span>These therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of
Galilee, and desired him, saying: Sir, we would see
Jesus.</span></li>
<li><span>Philip cometh, and telleth Andrew. Again Andrew and
Philip told Jesus.</span></li>
<li><span>But Jesus answered them, saying: The hour is come, that
the Son of man should be glorified.</span></li>
<li><span>Amen, amen I say to you, unless the grain of wheat
falling into the ground die,</span></li>
<li><span>Itself remaineth alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth
much fruit. He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that
hateth his life in this world, keepeth it unto life
eternal.</span></li>
<li><span>If any man minister to me, let him follow me; and where I
am, there also shall my minister be. If any man minister to me, him
will my Father honour.</span></li>
<li><span>Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? Father,
save me from this hour. But for this cause I came unto this
hour.</span></li>
<li><span>Father, glorify thy name. A voice therefore came from
heaven: I have both glorified it, and will glorify it
again.</span></li>
<li><span>The multitude therefore that stood and heard, said that
it thundered. Others said: An angel spoke to him.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered, and said: This voice came not because of
me, but for your sakes.</span></li>
<li><span>Now is the judgment of the world: now shall the prince of
this world be cast out.</span></li>
<li><span>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all
things to myself.</span></li>
<li><span>(Now this he said, signifying what death he should
die.)</span></li>
<li><span>The multitude answered him: We have heard out of the law,
that Christ abideth for ever; and how sayest thou: The Son of man
must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus therefore said to them: Yet a little while, the
light is among you. Walk whilst you have the light, that the
darkness overtake you not. And he that walketh in darkness, knoweth
not whither he goeth.</span></li>
<li><span>Whilst you have the light, believe in the light, that you
may be the children of light. These things Jesus spoke; and he went
away, and hid himself from them.</span></li>
<li><span>And whereas he had done so many miracles before them,
they believed not in him:</span></li>
<li><span>That the saying of Isaias the prophet might be fulfilled,
which he said: Lord, who hath believed our hearing? and to whom
hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore they could not believe, because Isaias said
again:</span></li>
<li><span>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart,
that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their
heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</span></li>
<li><span>These things said Isaias, when he saw his glory, and
spoke of him.</span></li>
<li><span>However, many of the chief men also believed in him; but
because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, that they might
not be cast out of the synagogue.</span></li>
<li><span>For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of
God.</span></li>
<li><span>But Jesus cried, and said: He that believeth in me, doth
not believe in me, but in him that sent me.</span></li>
<li><span>And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me.</span></li>
<li><span>I am come a light into the world; that whosoever
believeth in me, may not remain in darkness.</span></li>
<li><span>And if any man hear my words, and keep them not, I do not
judge him: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the
world.</span></li>
<li><span>He that despiseth me, and receiveth not my words, hath
one that judgeth him; the word that I have spoken, the same shall
judge him in the last day.</span></li>
<li><span>For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father who sent
me, he gave me commandment what I should say, and what I should
speak.</span></li>
<li><span>And I know that his commandment is life everlasting. The
things therefore that I speak, even as the Father said unto me, so
do I speak.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>Before the festival day of the pasch, Jesus knowing that
his hour was come, that he should pass out of this world to the
Father: having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them
unto the end.</span></li>
<li><span>And when supper was done, (the devil having now put into
the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray
him,)</span></li>
<li><span>Knowing that the Father had given him all things into his
hands, and that he came from God, and goeth to God;</span></li>
<li><span>He riseth from supper, and layeth aside his garments, and
having taken a towel, girded himself.</span></li>
<li><span>After that, he putteth water into a basin, and began to
wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them with the towel
wherewith he was girded.</span></li>
<li><span>He cometh therefore to Simon Peter. And Peter saith to
him: Lord, dost thou wash my feet?</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered, and said to him: What I do thou knowest
not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.</span></li>
<li><span>Peter saith to him: Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus
answered him: If I wash thee not, thou shalt have no part with
me.</span></li>
<li><span>Simon Peter saith to him: Lord, not only my feet, but
also my hands and my head.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus saith to him: He that is washed, needeth not but to
wash his feet, but is clean wholly. And you are clean, but not
all.</span></li>
<li><span>For he knew who he was that would betray him; therefore
he said: You are not all clean.</span></li>
<li><span>Then after he had washed their feet, and taken his
garments, being set down again, he said to them: Know you what I
have done to you?</span></li>
<li><span>You call me Master, and Lord; and you say well, for so I
am.</span></li>
<li><span>If then I being your Lord and Master, have washed your
feet; you also ought to wash one another's feet.</span></li>
<li><span>For I have given you an example, that as I have done to
you, so you do also.</span></li>
<li><span>Amen, amen I say to you: The servant is not greater than
his lord; neither is the apostle greater than he that sent
him.</span></li>
<li><span>If you know these things, you shall be blessed if you do
them.</span></li>
<li><span>I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen. But
that the scripture may be fulfilled: He that eateth bread with me,
shall lift up his heel against me.</span></li>
<li><span>At present I tell you, before it come to pass: that when
it shall come to pass, you may believe that I am he.</span></li>
<li><span>Amen, amen I say to you, he that receiveth whomsoever I
send, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that
sent me.</span></li>
<li><span>When Jesus had said these things, he was troubled in
spirit; and he testified, and said: Amen, amen I say to you, one of
you shall betray me.</span></li>
<li><span>The disciples therefore looked one upon another, doubting
of whom he spoke.</span></li>
<li><span>Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his
disciples, whom Jesus loved.</span></li>
<li><span>Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, and said to him:
Who is it of whom he speaketh?</span></li>
<li><span>He therefore, leaning on the breast of Jesus, saith to
him: Lord, who is it?</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered: He it is to whom I shall reach bread
dipped. And when he had dipped the bread, he gave it to Judas
Iscariot, the son of Simon.</span></li>
<li><span>And after the morsel, Satan entered into him. And Jesus
said to him: That which thou dost, do quickly.</span></li>
<li><span>Now no man at the table knew to what purpose he said this
unto him.</span></li>
<li><span>For some thought, because Judas had the purse, that Jesus
had said to him: Buy those things which we have need of for the
festival day: or that he should give something to the
poor.</span></li>
<li><span>He therefore having received the morsel, went out
immediately. And it was night.</span></li>
<li><span>When he therefore was gone out, Jesus said: Now is the
Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</span></li>
<li><span>If God be glorified in him, God also will glorify him in
himself; and immediately will he glorify him.</span></li>
<li><span>Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You
shall seek me; and as I said to the Jews: Whither I go you cannot
come; so I say to you now.</span></li>
<li><span>A new commandment I give unto you: That you love one
another, as I have loved you, that you also love one
another.</span></li>
<li><span>By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if
you have love one for another.</span></li>
<li><span>Simon Peter saith to him: Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus
answered: Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou
shalt follow hereafter.</span></li>
<li><span>Peter saith to him: Why cannot I follow thee now? I will
lay down my life for thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered him: Wilt thou lay down thy life for me?
Amen, amen I say to thee, the cock shall not crow, till thou deny
me thrice.</span></li>

<li><span>Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God,
believe also in me.</span></li>
<li><span>In my Father's house there are many mansions. If not, I
would have told you: because I go to prepare a place for
you.</span></li>
<li><span>And if I shall go, and prepare a place for you, I will
come again, and will take you to myself; that where I am, you also
may be.</span></li>
<li><span>And whither I go you know, and the way you
know.</span></li>
<li><span>Thomas saith to him: Lord, we know not whither thou
goest; and how can we know the way?</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus saith to him: I am the way, and the truth, and the
life. No man cometh to the Father, but by me.</span></li>
<li><span>If you had known me, you would without doubt have known
my Father also: and from henceforth you shall know him, and you
have seen him.</span></li>
<li><span>Philip saith to him: Lord, shew us the Father, and it is
enough for us.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus saith to him: Have I been so long a time with you;
and have you not known me? Philip, he that seeth me seeth the
Father also. How sayest thou, Shew us the Father?</span></li>
<li><span>Do you not believe, that I am in the Father, and the
Father in me? The words that I speak to you, I speak not of myself.
But the Father who abideth in me, he doth the works.</span></li>
<li><span>Believe you not that I am in the Father, and the Father
in me?</span></li>
<li><span>Otherwise believe for the very works' sake. Amen, amen I
say to you, he that believeth in me, the works that I do, he also
shall do; and greater than these shall he do.</span></li>
<li><span>Because I go to the Father: and whatsoever you shall ask
the Father in my name, that will I do: that the Father may be
glorified in the Son.</span></li>
<li><span>If you shall ask me any thing in my name, that I will
do.</span></li>
<li><span>If you love me, keep my commandments.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will ask the Father, and he shall give you another
Paraclete, that he may abide with you for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>The spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive,
because it seeth him not, nor knoweth him: but you shall know him;
because he shall abide with you, and shall be in you.</span></li>
<li><span>I will not leave you orphans, I will come to
you.</span></li>
<li><span>Yet a little while: and the world seeth me no more. But
you see me: because I live, and you shall live.</span></li>
<li><span>In that day you shall know, that I am in my Father, and
you in me, and I in you.</span></li>
<li><span>He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them; he it is
that loveth me. And he that loveth me, shall be loved of my Father:
and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.</span></li>
<li><span>Judas saith to him, not the Iscariot: Lord, how is it,
that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not to the
world?</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered, and said to him: If any one love me, he
will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to
him, and will make our abode with him.</span></li>
<li><span>He that loveth me not, keepeth not my words. And the word
which you have heard, is not mine; but the Father's who sent
me.</span></li>
<li><span>These things have I spoken to you, abiding with
you.</span></li>
<li><span>But the Paraclete, the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will
send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring all things
to your mind, whatsoever I shall have said to you.</span></li>
<li><span>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as
the world giveth, do I give unto you. Let not your heart be
troubled, nor let it be afraid.</span></li>
<li><span>You have heard that I said to you: I go away, and I come
unto you. If you loved me, you would indeed be glad, because I go
to the Father: for the Father is greater than I.</span></li>
<li><span>And now I have told you before it comes to pass: that
when it shall come to pass, you may believe.</span></li>
<li><span>I will not now speak many things with you. For the prince
of this world cometh, and in me he hath not any thing.</span></li>
<li><span>But that the world may know, that I love the Father: and
as the Father hath given me commandment, so do I: Arise, let us go
hence.</span></li>

<li><span>If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love;
as I also have kept my Father's commandments, and do abide in his
love.</span></li>
<li><span>These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in
you, and your joy may be filled.</span></li>
<li><span>This is my commandment, that you love one another, as I
have loved you.</span></li>
<li><span>Greater love than this no man hath, that a man lay down
his life for his friends.</span></li>
<li><span>You are my friends, if you do the things that I command
you.</span></li>
<li><span>I will not now call you servants: for the servant knoweth
not what his lord doth. But I have called you friends: because all
things whatsoever I have heard of my Father, I have made known to
you.</span></li>
<li><span>You have not chosen me: but I have chosen you; and have
appointed you, that you should go, and should bring forth fruit;
and your fruit should remain: that whatsoever you shall ask of the
Father in my name, he may give it you.</span></li>
<li><span>These things I command you, that you love one
another.</span></li>
<li><span>If the world hate you, know ye, that it hath hated me
before you.</span></li>
<li><span>If you had been of the world, the world would love its
own: but because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you
out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</span></li>
<li><span>Remember my word that I said to you: The servant is not
greater than his master. If they have persecuted me, they will also
persecute you: if they have kept my word, they will keep yours
also.</span></li>
<li><span>But all these things they will do to you for my name's
sake: because they know not him who sent me.</span></li>
<li><span>If I had not come, and spoken to them, they would not
have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.</span></li>
<li><span>He that hateth me, hateth my Father also.</span></li>
<li><span>If I had not done among them the works that no other man
hath done, they would not have sin; but now they have both seen and
hated both me and my Father.</span></li>
<li><span>But that the word may be fulfilled which is written in
their law: They hated me without cause.</span></li>
<li><span>But when the Paraclete cometh, whom I will send you from
the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceedeth from the Father, he
shall give testimony of me.</span></li>
<li><span>And you shall give testimony, because you are with me
from the beginning.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>These things have I spoken to you, that you may not be
scandalized.</span></li>
<li><span>They will put you out of the synagogues: yea, the hour
cometh, that whosoever killeth you, will think that he doth a
service to God.</span></li>
<li><span>And these things will they do to you; because they have
not known the Father, nor me.</span></li>
<li><span>But these things I have told you, that when the hour
shall come, you may remember that I told you of them.</span></li>
<li><span>But I told you not these things from the beginning,
because I was with you. And now I go to him that sent me, and none
of you asketh me: Whither goest thou?</span></li>
<li><span>But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow
hath filled your heart.</span></li>
<li><span>But I tell you the truth: it is expedient to you that I
go: for if I go not, the Paraclete will not come to you; but if I
go, I will send him to you.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he is come, he will convince the world of sin,
and of justice, and of judgment.</span></li>
<li><span>Of sin: because they believed not in me.</span></li>
<li><span>And of justice: because I go to the Father; and you shall
see me no longer.</span></li>
<li><span>And of judgment: because the prince of this world is
already judged.</span></li>
<li><span>I have yet many things to say to you: but you cannot bear
them now.</span></li>
<li><span>But when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will teach
you all truth. For he shall not speak of himself; but what things
soever he shall hear, he shall speak; and the things that are to
come, he shall shew you.</span></li>
<li><span>He shall glorify me; because he shall receive of mine,
and shall shew it to you.</span></li>
<li><span>All things whatsoever the Father hath, are mine.
Therefore I said, that he shall receive of mine, and shew it to
you.</span></li>
<li><span>A little while, and now you shall not see me; and again a
little while, and you shall see me: because I go to the
Father.</span></li>
<li><span>Then some of the disciples said one to another: What is
this that he saith to us: A little while, and you shall not see me;
and again a little while, and you shall see me, and, because I go
to the Father?</span></li>
<li><span>They said therefore: What is this that he saith, A little
while? we know not what he speaketh.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jesus knew that they had a mind to ask him; and he
said to them: Of this do you inquire among yourselves, because I
said: A little while, and you shall not see me; and again a little
while, and you shall see me?</span></li>
<li><span>Amen, amen I say to you, that you shall lament and weep,
but the world shall rejoice; and you shall be made sorrowful, but
your sorrow shall be turned into joy.</span></li>
<li><span>A woman, when she is in labour, hath sorrow, because her
hour is come; but when she hath brought forth the child, she
remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into
the world.</span></li>
<li><span>So also you now indeed have sorrow; but I will see you
again, and your heart shall rejoice; and your joy no man shall take
from you.</span></li>
<li><span>And in that day you shall not ask me any thing. Amen,
amen I say to you: if you ask the Father any thing in my name, he
will give it you.</span></li>
<li><span>Hitherto you have not asked any thing in my name. Ask,
and you shall receive; that your joy may be full.</span></li>
<li><span>These things I have spoken to you in proverbs. The hour
cometh, when I will no more speak to you in proverbs, but will shew
you plainly of the Father.</span></li>
<li><span>In that day you shall ask in my name; and I say not to
you, that I will ask the Father for you:</span></li>
<li><span>For the Father himself loveth you, because you have loved
me, and have believed that I came out from God.</span></li>
<li><span>I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world:
again I leave the world, and I go to the Father.</span></li>
<li><span>His disciples say to him: Behold, now thou speakest
plainly, and speakest no proverb.</span></li>
<li><span>Now we know that thou knowest all things, and thou
needest not that any man should ask thee. By this we believe that
thou camest forth from God.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered them: Do you now believe?</span></li>
<li><span>Behold, the hour cometh, and it is now come, that you
shall be scattered every man to his own, and shall leave me alone;
and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</span></li>
<li><span>These things I have spoken to you, that in me you may
have peace. In the world you shall have distress: but have
confidence, I have overcome the world.</span></li>

<li><span>These things Jesus spoke, and lifting up his eyes to
heaven, he said: Father, the hour is come, glorify thy Son, that
thy Son may glorify thee.</span></li>
<li><span>As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he may
give eternal life to all whom thou hast given him.</span></li>
<li><span>Now this is eternal life: That they may know thee, the
only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.</span></li>
<li><span>I have glorified thee on the earth; I have finished the
work which thou gavest me to do.</span></li>
<li><span>And now glorify thou me, O Father, with thyself, with the
glory which I had, before the world was, with thee.</span></li>
<li><span>I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou hast
given me out of the world. Thine they were, and to me thou gavest
them; and they have kept thy word.</span></li>
<li><span>Now they have known, that all things which thou hast
given me, are from thee:</span></li>
<li><span>Because the words which thou gavest me, I have given to
them; and they have received them, and have known in very deed that
I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send
me.</span></li>
<li><span>I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them
whom thou hast given me: because they are thine:</span></li>
<li><span>And all my things are thine, and thine are mine; and I am
glorified in them.</span></li>
<li><span>And now I am not in the world, and these are in the
world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy name whom
thou has given me; that they may be one, as we also
are.</span></li>
<li><span>While I was with them, I kept them in thy name. Those
whom thou gavest me have I kept; and none of them is lost, but the
son of perdition, that the scripture may be fulfilled.</span></li>
<li><span>And now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the
world, that they may have my joy filled in themselves.</span></li>
<li><span>I have given them thy word, and the world hath hated
them, because they are not of the world; as I also am not of the
world.</span></li>
<li><span>I pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the world,
but that thou shouldst keep them from evil.</span></li>
<li><span>They are not of the world, as I also am not of the
world.</span></li>
<li><span>Sanctify them in truth. Thy word is truth.</span></li>
<li><span>As thou hast sent me into the world, I also have sent
them into the world.</span></li>
<li><span>And for them do I sanctify myself, that they also may be
sanctified in truth.</span></li>
<li><span>And not for them only do I pray, but for them also who
through their word shall believe in me;</span></li>
<li><span>That they all may be one, as thou, Father, in me, and I
in thee; that they also may be one in us; that the world may
believe that thou hast sent me.</span></li>
<li><span>And the glory which thou hast given me, I have given to
them; that they may be one, as we also are one:</span></li>
<li><span>I in them, and thou in me; that they may be made perfect
in one: and the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast
loved them, as thou hast also loved me.</span></li>
<li><span>Father, I will that where I am, they also whom thou hast
given me may be with me; that they may see my glory which thou hast
given me, because thou hast loved me before the creation of the
world.</span></li>
<li><span>Just Father, the world hath not known thee; but I have
known thee: and these have known that thou hast sent
me.</span></li>
<li><span>And I have made known thy name to them, and will make it
known; that the love wherewith thou hast loved me, may be in them,
and I in them.</span></li>

<li><span>When Jesus had said these things, he went forth with his
disciples over the brook Cedron, where there was a garden, into
which he entered with his disciples.</span></li>
<li><span>And Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the place; because
Jesus had often resorted thither together with his
disciples.</span></li>
<li><span>Judas therefore having received a band of soldiers and
servants from the chief priests and the Pharisees, cometh thither
with lanterns and torches and weapons.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon
him, went forth, and said to them: Whom seek ye?</span></li>
<li><span>They answered him: Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith to
them: I am he. And Judas also, who betrayed him, stood with
them.</span></li>
<li><span>As soon therefore as he had said to them: I am he; they
went backward, and fell to the ground.</span></li>
<li><span>Again therefore he asked them: Whom seek ye? And they
said, Jesus of Nazareth.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he. If
therefore you seek me, let these go their way.</span></li>
<li><span>That the word might be fulfilled which he said: Of them
whom thou hast given me, I have not lost any one.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it, and struck the
servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. And the name
of the servant was Malchus.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus therefore said to Peter: Put up thy sword into the
scabbard. The chalice which my Father hath given me, shall I not
drink it?</span></li>
<li><span>Then the band and the tribune, and the servants of the
Jews, took Jesus, and bound him:</span></li>
<li><span>And they led him away to Annas first, for he was father
in law to Caiphas, who was the high priest of that
year.</span></li>
<li><span>Now Caiphas was he who had given the counsel to the Jews:
That it was expedient that one man should die for the
people.</span></li>
<li><span>And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another
disciple. And that disciple was known to the high priest, and went
in with Jesus into the court of the high priest.</span></li>
<li><span>But Peter stood at the door without. The other disciple
therefore, who was known to the high priest, went out, and spoke to
the portress, and brought in Peter.</span></li>
<li><span>The maid therefore that was portress, saith to Peter: Art
not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith: I am
not.</span></li>
<li><span>Now the servants and ministers stood at a fire of coals,
because it was cold, and warmed themselves. And with them was Peter
also, standing, and warming himself.</span></li>
<li><span>The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples,
and of his doctrine.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered him: I have spoken openly to the world: I
have always taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither all
the Jews resort; and in secret I have spoken nothing.</span></li>
<li><span>Why asketh thou me? ask them who have heard what I have
spoken unto them: behold they know what things I have
said.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he had said these things, one of the servants
standing by, gave Jesus a blow, saying: Answerest thou the high
priest so?</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered him: If I have spoken evil, give testimony
of the evil; but if well, why strikest thou me?</span></li>
<li><span>And Annas sent him bound to Caiphas the high
priest.</span></li>
<li><span>And Simon Peter was standing, and warming himself. They
said therefore to him: Art not thou also one of his disciples? He
denied it, and said: I am not.</span></li>
<li><span>One of the servants of the high priest (a kinsman to him
whose ear Peter cut off) saith to him: Did I not see thee in the
garden with him?</span></li>
<li><span>Again therefore Peter denied; and immediately the cock
crew.</span></li>
<li><span>Then they led Jesus from Caiphas to the governor's hall.
And it was morning; and they went not into the hall, that they
might not be defiled, but that they might eat the
pasch.</span></li>
<li><span>Pilate therefore went out to them, and said: What
accusation bring you against this man?</span></li>
<li><span>They answered, and said to him: If he were not a
malefactor, we would not have delivered him up to thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Pilate therefore said to them: Take him you, and judge
him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him: It is
not lawful for us to put any man to death;</span></li>
<li><span>That the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he said,
signifying what death he should die.</span></li>
<li><span>Pilate therefore went into the hall again, and called
Jesus, and said to him: Art thou the king of the Jews?</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered: Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or
have others told it thee of me?</span></li>
<li><span>Pilate answered: Am I a Jew? Thy own nation, and the
chief priests, have delivered thee up to me: what hast thou
done?</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered: My kingdom is not of this world. If my
kingdom were of this world, my servants would certainly strive that
I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now my kingdom is not
from hence.</span></li>
<li><span>Pilate therefore said to him: Art thou a king then? Jesus
answered: Thou sayest that I am a king. For this was I born, and
for this came I into the world; that I should give testimony to the
truth. Every one that is of the truth, heareth my
voice.</span></li>
<li><span>Pilate saith to him: What is truth? And when he said
this, he went out again to the Jews, and saith to them: I find no
cause in him.</span></li>
<li><span>But you have a custom that I should release one unto you
at the pasch: will you, therefore, that I release unto you the king
of the Jews?</span></li>
<li><span>Then cried they all again, saying: Not this man, but
Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="19">John 19</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Then therefore, Pilate took Jesus, and scourged
him.</span></li>
<li><span>And the soldiers platting a crown of thorns, put it upon
his head; and they put on him a purple garment.</span></li>
<li><span>And they came to him, and said: Hail, king of the Jews;
and they gave him blows.</span></li>
<li><span>Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith to them:
Behold, I bring him forth unto you, that you may know that I find
no cause in him.</span></li>
<li><span>(Jesus therefore came forth, bearing the crown of thorns
and the purple garment.) And he saith to them: Behold the
Man.</span></li>
<li><span>When the chief priests, therefore, and the servants, had
seen him, they cried out, saying: Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate
saith to them: Take him you, and crucify him: for I find no cause
in him.</span></li>
<li><span>The Jews answered him: We have a law; and according to
the law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of
God.</span></li>
<li><span>When Pilate therefore had heard this saying, he feared
the more.</span></li>
<li><span>And he entered into the hall again, and he said to Jesus:
Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.</span></li>
<li><span>Pilate therefore saith to him: Speakest thou not to me?
knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and I have
power to release thee?</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus answered: Thou shouldst not have any power against
me, unless it were given thee from above. Therefore, he that hath
delivered me to thee, hath the greater sin.</span></li>
<li><span>And from henceforth Pilate sought to release him. But the
Jews cried out, saying: If thou release this man, thou art not
Caesar's friend. For whosoever maketh himself a king, speaketh
against Caesar.</span></li>
<li><span>Now when Pilate had heard these words, he brought Jesus
forth, and sat down in the judgment seat, in the place that is
called Lithostrotos, and in Hebrew Gabbatha.</span></li>
<li><span>And it was the parasceve of the pasch, about the sixth
hour, and he saith to the Jews: Behold your king.</span></li>
<li><span>But they cried out: Away with him; away with him; crucify
him. Pilate saith to them: Shall I crucify your king? The chief
priests answered: We have no king but Caesar.</span></li>
<li><span>Then therefore he delivered him to them to be crucified.
And they took Jesus, and led him forth.</span></li>
<li><span>And bearing his own cross, he went forth to that place
which is called Calvary, but in Hebrew Golgotha.</span></li>
<li><span>Where they crucified him, and with him two others, one on
each side, and Jesus in the midst.</span></li>
<li><span>And Pilate wrote a title also, and he put it upon the
cross. And the writing was: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE
JEWS.</span></li>
<li><span>This title therefore many of the Jews did read: because
the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it
was written in Hebrew, in Greek, and in Latin.</span></li>
<li><span>Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate: Write
not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am the King of the
Jews.</span></li>
<li><span>Pilate answered: What I have written, I have
written.</span></li>
<li><span>The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified him, took
his garments, (and they made four parts, to every soldier a part,)
and also his coat. Now the coat was without seam, woven from the
top throughout.</span></li>
<li><span>They said then one to another: Let us not cut it, but let
us cast lots for it, whose it shall be; that the scripture might be
fulfilled, saying: They have parted my garments among them, and
upon my vesture they have cast lot. And the soldiers indeed did
these things.</span></li>
<li><span>Now there stood by the cross of Jesus, his mother, and
his mother's sister, Mary of Cleophas, and Mary
Magdalen.</span></li>
<li><span>When Jesus therefore had seen his mother and the disciple
standing whom he loved, he saith to his mother: Woman, behold thy
son.</span></li>
<li><span>After that, he saith to the disciple: Behold thy mother.
And from that hour, the disciple took her to his own.</span></li>
<li><span>Afterwards, Jesus knowing that all things were now
accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, said: I
thirst.</span></li>
<li><span>Now there was a vessel set there full of vinegar. And
they, putting a sponge full of vinegar and hyssop, put it to his
mouth.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus therefore, when he had taken the vinegar, said: It
is consummated. And bowing his head, he gave up the
ghost.</span></li>
<li><span>Then the Jews, (because it was the parasceve,) that the
bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath day, (for that
was a great sabbath day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be
broken, and that they might be taken away.</span></li>
<li><span>The soldiers therefore came; and they broke the legs of
the first, and of the other that was crucified with
him.</span></li>
<li><span>But after they were come to Jesus, when they saw that he
was already dead, they did not break his legs.</span></li>
<li><span>But one of the soldiers with a spear opened his side, and
immediately there came out blood and water.</span></li>
<li><span>And he that saw it, hath given testimony, and his
testimony is true. And he knoweth that he saith true; that you also
may believe.</span></li>
<li><span>For these things were done, that the scripture might be
fulfilled: You shall not break a bone of him.</span></li>
<li><span>And again another scripture saith: They shall look on him
whom they pierced.</span></li>
<li><span>And after these things, Joseph of Arimathea (because he
was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews)
besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. And
Pilate gave leave. He came therefore, and took the body of
Jesus.</span></li>
<li><span>And Nicodemus also came, (he who at the first came to
Jesus by night,) bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an
hundred pound weight.</span></li>
<li><span>They took therefore the body of Jesus, and bound it in
linen cloths, with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to
bury.</span></li>
<li><span>Now there was in the place where he was crucified, a
garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein no man yet had
been laid.</span></li>
<li><span>There, therefore, because of the parasceve of the Jews,
they laid Jesus, because the sepulchre was nigh at
hand.</span></li>

<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="20">John 20</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalen cometh
early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre; and she saw the
stone taken away from the sepulchre.</span></li>
<li><span>She ran, therefore, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the
other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith to them: They have taken
away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have
laid him.</span></li>
<li><span>Peter therefore went out, and that other disciple, and
they came to the sepulchre.</span></li>
<li><span>And they both ran together, and that other disciple did
outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he stooped down, he saw the linen cloths lying;
but yet he went not in.</span></li>
<li><span>Then cometh Simon Peter, following him, and went into the
sepulchre, and saw the linen cloths lying,</span></li>
<li><span>And the napkin that had been about his head, not lying
with the linen cloths, but apart, wrapped up into one
place.</span></li>
<li><span>Then that other disciple also went in, who came first to
the sepulchre: and he saw, and believed.</span></li>
<li><span>For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise
again from the dead.</span></li>
<li><span>The disciples therefore departed again to their
home.</span></li>
<li><span>But Mary stood at the sepulchre without, weeping. Now as
she was weeping, she stooped down, and looked into the
sepulchre,</span></li>
<li><span>And she saw two angels in white, sitting, one at the
head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been
laid.</span></li>
<li><span>They say to her: Woman, why weepest thou? She saith to
them: Because they have taken away my Lord; and I know not where
they have laid him.</span></li>
<li><span>When she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw
Jesus standing; and she knew not that it was Jesus.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus saith to her: Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest
thou? She, thinking it was the gardener, saith to him: Sir, if thou
hast taken him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will
take him away.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus saith to her: Mary. She turning, saith to him:
Rabboni (which is to say, Master).</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus saith to her: Do not touch me, for I am not yet
ascended to my Father. But go to my brethren, and say to them: I
ascend to my Father and to your Father, to my God and your
God.</span></li>
<li><span>Mary Magdalen cometh, and telleth the disciples: I have
seen the Lord, and these things he said to me.</span></li>
<li><span>Now when it was late that same day, the first of the
week, and the doors were shut, where the disciples were gathered
together, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst,
and said to them: Peace be to you.</span></li>
<li><span>And when he had said this, he shewed them his hands and
his side. The disciples therefore were glad, when they saw the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>He said therefore to them again: Peace be to you. As the
Father hath sent me, I also send you.</span></li>
<li><span>When he had said this, he breathed on them; and he said
to them: Receive ye the Holy Ghost.</span></li>
<li><span>Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and
whose sins you shall retain, they are retained.</span></li>
<li><span>Now Thomas, one of the twelve, who is called Didymus, was
not with them when Jesus came.</span></li>
<li><span>The other disciples therefore said to him: We have seen
the Lord. But he said to them: Except I shall see in his hands the
print of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails,
and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.</span></li>
<li><span>And after eight days again his disciples were within, and
Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in
the midst, and said: Peace be to you.</span></li>
<li><span>Then he saith to Thomas: Put in thy finger hither, and
see my hands; and bring hither thy hand, and put it into my side;
and be not faithless, but believing.</span></li>
<li><span>Thomas answered, and said to him: My Lord, and my
God.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus saith to him: Because thou hast seen me, Thomas,
thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and have
believed.</span></li>
<li><span>Many other signs also did Jesus in the sight of his
disciples, which are not written in this book.</span></li>
<li><span>But these are written, that you may believe that Jesus is
the Christ, the Son of God: and that believing, you may have life
in his name.</span></li>

<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="21">John 21</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>After this, Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples
at the sea of Tiberias. And he shewed himself after this
manner.</span></li>
<li><span>There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas, who is
called Didymus, and Nathanael, who was of Cana of Galilee, and the
sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples.</span></li>
<li><span>Simon Peter saith to them: I go a fishing. They say to
him: We also come with thee. And they went forth, and entered into
the ship: and that night they caught nothing.</span></li>
<li><span>But when the morning was come, Jesus stood on the shore:
yet the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus therefore said to them: Children, have you any
meat? They answered him: No.</span></li>
<li><span>He saith to them: Cast the net on the right side of the
ship, and you shall find. They cast therefore; and now they were
not able to draw it, for the multitude of fishes.</span></li>
<li><span>That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved, said to Peter:
It is the Lord. Simon Peter, when he heard that it was the Lord,
girt his coat about him, (for he was naked,) and cast himself into
the sea.</span></li>
<li><span>But the other disciples came in the ship, (for they were
not far from the land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging
the net with fishes.</span></li>
<li><span>As soon then as they came to land, they saw hot coals
lying, and a fish laid thereon, and bread.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus saith to them: Bring hither of the fishes which you
have now caught.</span></li>
<li><span>Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of
great fishes, one hundred and fifty-three. And although there were
so many, the net was not broken.</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus saith to them: Come, and dine. And none of them who
were at meat, durst ask him: Who art thou? knowing that it was the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And Jesus cometh and taketh bread, and giveth them, and
fish in like manner.</span></li>
<li><span>This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to
his disciples, after he was risen from the dead.</span></li>
<li><span>When therefore they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon
Peter: Simon son of John, lovest thou me more than these? He saith
to him: Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him:
Feed my lambs.</span></li>
<li><span>He saith to him again: Simon, son of John, lovest thou
me? He saith to him: Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He
saith to him: Feed my lambs.</span></li>
<li><span>He said to him the third time: Simon, son of John, lovest
thou me? Peter was grieved, because he had said to him the third
time: Lovest thou me? And he said to him: Lord, thou knowest all
things: thou knowest that I love thee. He said to him: Feed my
sheep.</span></li>
<li><span>Amen, amen I say to thee, when thou wast younger, thou
didst gird thyself, and didst walk where thou wouldst. But when
thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another
shall gird thee, and lead thee whither thou wouldst
not.</span></li>
<li><span>And this he said, signifying by what death he should
glorify God. And when he had said this, he saith to him: Follow
me.</span></li>
<li><span>Peter turning about, saw that disciple whom Jesus loved
following, who also leaned on his breast at supper, and said: Lord,
who is he that shall betray thee?</span></li>
<li><span>Him therefore when Peter had seen, he saith to Jesus:
Lord, and what shall this man do?</span></li>
<li><span>Jesus saith to him: So I will have him to remain till I
come, what is it to thee? follow thou me.</span></li>
<li><span>This saying therefore went abroad among the brethren,
that that disciple should not die. And Jesus did not say to him: He
should not die; but, So I will have him to remain till I come, what
is it to thee?</span></li>
<li><span>This is that disciple who giveth testimony of these
things, and hath written these things; and we know that his
testimony is true.</span></li>
<li><span>But there are also many other things which Jesus did;
which, if they were written every one, the world itself, I think,
would not be able to contain the books that should be
written.</span></li>
