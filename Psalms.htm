<ol>
<li><span>Blessed is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of
the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the chair
of pestilence.</span></li>
<li><span>But his will is in the law of the Lord, and on his law he
shall meditate day and night.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall be like a tree which is planted near the
running waters, which shall bring forth its fruit, in due season.
And his leaf shall not fall off: and all whosoever he shall do
shall prosper.</span></li>
<li><span>Not so the wicked, not so: but like the dust, which the
wind driveth from the face of the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore the wicked shall not rise again in judgment:
nor sinners in the council of the just.</span></li>
<li><span>For the Lord knoweth the way of the just: and the way of
the wicked shall perish.</span></li>

<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="2">Psalms 2</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Why have the Gentiles raged, and the people devised vain
things?</span></li>
<li><span>The kings of the earth stood up, and the princes met
together, against the Lord and against his Christ.</span></li>
<li><span>Let us break their bonds asunder: and let us cast away
their yoke from us.</span></li>
<li><span>He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh at them: and the
Lord shall deride them.</span></li>
<li><span>Then shall he speak to them in his anger, and trouble
them in his rage.</span></li>
<li><span>But I am appointed king by him over Sion his holy
mountain, preaching his commandment.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord hath said to me: Thou art my son, this day have
I begotten thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Ask of me, and I will give thee the Gentiles for thy
inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth for thy
possession.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron, and shalt break
them in pieces like a potter's vessel.</span></li>
<li><span>And now, O ye kings, understand: receive instruction, you
that judge the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>Serve ye the Lord with fear: and rejoice unto him with
trembling.</span></li>
<li><span>Embrace discipline, lest at any time the Lord be angry,
and you perish from the just way.</span></li>
<li><span>When his wrath shall be kindled in a short time, blessed
are all they that trust in him.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>The psalm of David when he fled from the face of his son
Absalom.</span></li>
<li><span>Why, O Lord, are they multiplied that afflict me? many
are they who rise up against me.</span></li>
<li><span>Many say to my soul: There is no salvation for him in his
God.</span></li>
<li><span>But thou, O Lord art my protector, my glory, and the
lifter up of my head.</span></li>
<li><span>I have cried to the Lord with my voice: and he hath heard
me from his holy hill.</span></li>
<li><span>I have slept and taken my rest: and I have risen up,
because the Lord hath protected me.</span></li>
<li><span>I will not fear thousands of the people, surrounding me:
arise, O Lord; save me, O my God.</span></li>
<li><span>For thou hast struck all them who are my adversaries
without cause: thou hast broken the teeth of sinners.</span></li>
<li><span>Salvation is of the Lord: and thy blessing is upon thy
people.</span></li>

<li><span>Unto the end, in verses. A psalm of David.</span></li>
<li><span>When I called upon him, the God of my justice heard me:
when I was in distress, thou hast enlarged me. Have mercy on me:
and hear my prayer.</span></li>
<li><span>O ye sons of men, how long will you be dull of heart? why
do you love vanity, and seek after lying?</span></li>
<li><span>Know ye also that the Lord hath made his holy one
wonderful: the Lord will hear me when I shall cry unto
him.</span></li>
<li><span>Be angry, and sin not: the things you say in your hearts,
be sorry for them upon your beds.</span></li>
<li><span>Offer up the sacrifice of justice, and trust in the Lord:
many say, Who sheweth us good things?</span></li>
<li><span>The light of thy countenance O Lord, is signed upon us:
thou hast given gladness in my heart.</span></li>
<li><span>By the fruit of their corn, their wine and oil, they are
multiplied.</span></li>
<li><span>In peace in the selfsame I will sleep, and I will
rest:</span></li>
<li><span>for thou, O Lord, singularly hast settled me in
hope.</span></li>

<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="5">Psalms 5</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Unto the end, for her that obtaineth the inheritance. A
psalm of David.</span></li>
<li><span>Give ear, O Lord, to my words, understand my
cry.</span></li>
<li><span>Hearken to the voice of my prayer, O my King and my
God.</span></li>
<li><span>For to thee will I pray: O Lord, in the morning thou
shalt hear my voice.</span></li>
<li><span>In the morning I will stand before thee, and will see:
because thou art not a God that willest iniquity.</span></li>
<li><span>Neither shall the wicked dwell near thee: nor shall the
unjust abide before thy eyes.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hatest all the workers of iniquity: Thou wilt
destroy all that speak a lie. The bloody and the deceitful man the
Lord will abhor.</span></li>
<li><span>But as for me in the multitude of thy mercy, I will come
into thy house; I will worship towards thy holy temple, in thy
fear.</span></li>
<li><span>Conduct me, O Lord, in thy justice: because of my
enemies, direct my way in thy sight.</span></li>
<li><span>for there is no truth in their mouth; their heart is
vain.</span></li>
<li><span>Their throat is an open sepulchre: they dealt deceitfully
with their tongues: judge them, O God. Let them fall from their
devices: according to the multitude of their wickedness cast them
out: for they have provoked thee, O Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>But let all them be glad that hope in thee: they shall
rejoice for ever, and thou shalt dwell in them. And all they that
love thy name shall glory in thee:</span></li>
<li><span>For thou wilt bless the just. O Lord, thou hast crowned
us, as with a shield of thy good will.</span></li>

<li><span>Unto the end, in verses, a psalm for David, for the
octave.</span></li>

in thy wrath.</span></li>
<li><span>Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am weak: heal me, O Lord,
for my bones are troubled.</span></li>
<li><span>And my soul is troubled exceedingly: but thou, O Lord,
how long?</span></li>
<li><span>Turn to me, O Lord, and deliver my soul: O save me for
thy mercy's sake.</span></li>
<li><span>For there is no one in death, that is mindful of thee:
and who shall confess to thee in hell?</span></li>
<li><span>I have laboured in my groanings, every night I will wash
my bed: I will water my couch with my tears.</span></li>
<li><span>My eye is troubled through indignation: I have grown old
amongst all my enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity: for the Lord
hath heard the voice of my weeping.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord hath heard my supplication: the Lord hath
received my prayer.</span></li>

let them be turned back, and be ashamed very speedily.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>The psalm of David which he sung to the Lord for the
words of Chusi the son of Jemini. [2 Kings 16.]</span></li>
<li><span>O Lord my God, in thee have I put my trust: save me from
all them that persecute me, and deliver me.</span></li>
<li><span>Lest at any time he seize upon my soul like a lion, while
there is no one to redeem me, nor to save.</span></li>
<li><span>O Lord my God, if I have done this thing, if there be
iniquity in my hands:</span></li>

deservedly fall empty before my enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>Let the enemy pursue my soul, and take it, and tread down
my life on the earth, and bring down my glory to the
dust.</span></li>
<li><span>Rise up, O Lord, in thy anger: and be thou exalted in the
borders of my enemies. And arise, O Lord my God, in the precept
which thou hast commanded:</span></li>

their sakes return thou on high.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord judgeth the people. Judge me, O Lord, according
to my justice, and according to my innocence in me.</span></li>
<li><span>The wickedness of sinners shall be brought to nought: and
thou shalt direct the just: the searcher of hearts and reins is
God.</span></li>

heart.</span></li>

every day?</span></li>

he hath bent his bow and made it ready.</span></li>
<li><span>And in it he hath prepared the instruments of death, he
hath made ready his arrows for them that burn.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold he hath been in labour with injustice; he hath
conceived sorrow, and brought forth iniquity.</span></li>
<li><span>He hath opened a pit and dug it; and he is fallen into
the hole he made.</span></li>
<li><span>His sorrow shall be turned on his own head: and his
iniquity shall comedown upon his crown.</span></li>

perished: thou hast blotted out their name for ever and
ever.</span></li>
<li><span>The swords of the enemy have failed unto the end: and
their cities thou hast destroyed. Their memory hath perished with a
noise.</span></li>

may declare all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of
Sion.</span></li>

fast in the destruction which they have prepared. Their foot hath
been taken in the very snare which they hid.</span></li>

sinner hath been caught in the works of his own hands.</span></li>

that forget God.</span></li>

patience of the poor shall not perish for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>Arise, O Lord, let not man be strengthened: let the
Gentiles be judged in thy sight.</span></li>

<li><span>God is not before his eyes: his ways are filthy at all
times. Thy judgments are removed from his sight: he shall rule over
all his enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>For he hath said in his heart: I shall not be moved from
generation to generation, and shall be without evil.</span></li>
<li><span>His mouth is full of cursing, and of bitterness, and of
deceit: under his tongue are labour and sorrow.</span></li>
<li><span>He sitteth in ambush with the rich in private places,
that he may kill the innocent.</span></li>
<li><span>His eyes are upon the poor man: He lieth in wait in
secret like a lion in his den. He lieth in ambush that he may catch
the poor man: to catch the poor, whilst he draweth him to
him.</span></li>
<li><span>In his net he will bring him down, he will crouch and
fall, when he shall have power over the poor.</span></li>
<li><span>For he hath said in his heart: God hath forgotten, he
hath turned away his face not to see to the end.</span></li>
<li><span>Arise, O Lord God, let thy hand be exalted: forget not
the poor.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore hath the wicked provoked God? for he hath said
in his heart: He will not require it.</span></li>

that thou mayst deliver them into thy hands. To thee is the poor
man left: thou wilt be a helper to the orphan.</span></li>

his sin shall be sought, and shall not be found.</span></li>

heard the preparation of their heart.</span></li>

<li><span>I will love thee, O Lord, my strength:</span></li>

<li><span>In my affliction I called upon the Lord, and I cried to
my God: And he heard my voice from his holy temple: and my cry
before him came into his ears.</span></li>
<li><span>The earth shook and trembled: the foundations of the
mountains were troubled and were moved, because he was angry with
them.</span></li>
<li><span>There went up a smoke in his wrath: and a fire flamed
from his face: coals were kindled by it.</span></li>
<li><span>He bowed the heavens, and came down: and darkness was
under his feet.</span></li>
<li><span>And he ascended upon the cherubim, and he flew; he flew
upon the wings of the winds.</span></li>
<li><span>And he made darkness his covert, his pavilion round about
him: dark waters in the clouds of the air.</span></li>
<li><span>At the brightness that was before him the clouds passed,
hail and coals of fire.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord thundered from heaven, and the highest gave
his voice: hail and coals of fire.</span></li>
<li><span>And he sent forth his arrows, and he scattered them: he
multiplied lightnings, and troubled them.</span></li>
<li><span>Then the fountains of waters appeared, and the
foundations of the world were discovered: At thy rebuke, O Lord, at
the blast of the spirit of thy wrath.</span></li>
<li><span>He sent from on high, and took me: and received me out of
many waters.</span></li>
<li><span>He delivered me from my strongest enemies, and from them
that hated me: for they were too strong for me.</span></li>
<li><span>They prevented me in the day of my affliction: and the
Lord became my protector.</span></li>
<li><span>And he brought me forth into a large place: he saved me,
because he was well pleased with me.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord will reward me according to my justice; and
will repay me according to the cleanness of my hands:</span></li>
<li><span>Because I have kept the ways of the Lord; and have not
done wickedly against my God.</span></li>
<li><span>For till his judgments are in my sight: and his justices
I have not put away from me.</span></li>
<li><span>And I shall be spotless with him: and shall keep myself
from my iniquity.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord will reward me according to my justice; and
according to the cleanness of my hands before his eyes.</span></li>
<li><span>With the holy, thou wilt be holy; and with the innocent
man thou wilt be innocent.</span></li>
<li><span>And with the elect thou wilt be elect: and with the
perverse thou wilt be perverted.</span></li>
<li><span>For thou wilt save the humble people; but wilt bring down
the eyes of the proud.</span></li>
<li><span>For thou lightest my lamp, O Lord: O my God enlighten my
darkness.</span></li>
<li><span>For by thee I shall be delivered from temptation; and

him.</span></li>

God?</span></li>

blameless.</span></li>

setteth me upon high places.</span></li>
<li><span>Who teacheth my hands to war: and thou hast made my arms
like a brazen bow.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou hast given me the protection of thy salvation:
and thy right hand hath held me up: And thy discipline hath
corrected me unto the end: and thy discipline, the same shall teach
me.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; and my feet are not
weakened.</span></li>
<li><span>I will pursue after my enemies, and overtake them: and I
will not turn again till they are consumed.</span></li>
<li><span>I will break them, and they shall not be able to stand:
they shall fall under my feet.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou hast girded me with strength unto battle; and
hast subdued under me them that rose up against me.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou hast made my enemies turn their back upon me,
and hast destroyed them that hated me.</span></li>
<li><span>They cried, but there was none to save them, to the Lord:
but he heard them not.</span></li>
<li><span>And I shall beat them as small as the dust before the
wind; I shall bring them to nought, like the dirt in the
streets.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou wilt deliver me from the contradictions of the
people: thou wilt make me head of the Gentiles.</span></li>
<li><span>A people, which I knew not, hath served me: at the
hearing of the ear they have obeyed me.</span></li>
<li><span>The children that are strangers have lied to me, strange
children have faded away, and have halted from their
paths.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord liveth, and blessed be my God, and let the God
of my salvation be exalted :</span></li>

my deliverer from my enemies.</span></li>

me: from the unjust man thou wilt deliver me.</span></li>

<li><span>With the Lord shall the steps of a man be directed, and

<li><span>When he shall fall he shall not be bruised, for the Lord
putteth his hand under him.</span></li>
<li><span>I have been young, and now am old; and I have not seen

punished, and the seed of the wicked shall perish.</span></li>

therein for evermore.</span></li>
<li><span>The mouth of the just shall meditate wisdom : and his
tongue shall speak judgment.</span></li>
<li><span>The law of his God is in his heart, and his steps shall
not be supplanted.</span></li>
<li><span>The wicked watcheth the just man, and seeketh to put him
to death,</span></li>
<li><span>But the Lord will not leave in his hands; nor condemn him
when he shall be judged.</span></li>
<li><span>Expect the Lord and keep his way : and he will exalt thee
to inherit the land : when the sinners shall perish thou shalt
see.</span></li>
<li><span>I have seen the wicked highly exalted, and lifted up like
the cedars of Libanus.</span></li>
<li><span>And I passed by, and lo, he was not : and I sought him
and his place was not found.</span></li>
<li><span>Keep innocence, and behold justice : for there are
remnants for the peaceable man.</span></li>
<li><span>But the unjust shall be destroyed together : the remnants
of the wicked shall perish.</span></li>
<li><span>But the salvation of the just is from the Lord, and he is
their protector in the time of trouble.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord will help them and deliver them : and he
will rescue them from the wicked, and save them, because they have
hoped in him.</span></li>

<li><span>A psalm for David, for a remembrance of the
sabbath.</span></li>
<li><span>Rebuke me not, O Lord, in thy indignation; nor chastise
me in thy wrath.</span></li>
<li><span>For thy arrows are fastened in me : and thy hand hath
been strong upon me.</span></li>
<li><span>There is no health in my flesh, because of thy wrath :
there is no peace for my bones, because of my sins.</span></li>
<li><span>For my iniquities are gone over my head : and as a heavy
burden are become heavy upon me.</span></li>
<li><span>My sores are putrified and corrupted, because of my
foolishness.</span></li>
<li><span>I am become miserable, and am bowed down even to the end
: I walked sorrowful all the day long.</span></li>
<li><span>For my loins are filled with illusions; and there is no
health in my flesh.</span></li>
<li><span>I am afflicted and humbled exceedingly : I roared with
the groaning of my heart.</span></li>
<li><span>Lord, all my desire is before thee, and my groaning is
not hidden from thee.</span></li>
<li><span>My heart is troubled, my strength hath left me, and the
light of my eyes itself is not with me.</span></li>
<li><span>My friends and my neighbours have drawn near, and stood
against me. And they that were near me stood afar off :</span></li>
<li><span>And they that sought my soul used violence. And they that
sought evils to me spoke vain things, and studied deceits all the
day long.</span></li>
<li><span>But I, as a deaf man, heard not : and as a dumb man not
opening his mouth.</span></li>
<li><span>And I became as a man that heareth not : and that hath no
reproofs in his mouth.</span></li>
<li><span>For in thee, O Lord, have I hoped : thou wilt hear me, O
Lord my God.</span></li>
<li><span>For I said: Lest at any time my enemies rejoice over me :
and whilst my feet are moved, they speak great things against
me.</span></li>
<li><span>For I am ready for scourges : and my sorrow is
continually before me.</span></li>

sin.</span></li>
<li><span>But my enemies live, and are stronger that I : and they
hate me wrongfully are multiplied.</span></li>

what is the number of my days : that I may know what is wanting to
me.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold thou hast made my days measurable : and my
substance is as nothing before thee. And indeed all things are
vanity : every man living.</span></li>

disquieted in vain. He storeth up : and he knoweth not for whom he

<li><span>And now what is my hope? is it not the Lord? and my

<li><span>Remove thy scourges from me. The strength of thy hand

disquieted.</span></li>

thy mercy and thy truth have always upheld me.</span></li>
<li><span>For evils without number have surrounded me; my
iniquities have overtaken me, and I was not able to see. They are
multiplied above the hairs of my head : and my heart hath forsaken

reprove thee, and set before thy face.</span></li>

And according to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my
iniquity.</span></li>
<li><span>Wash me yet more from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my
sin.</span></li>

me with a perfect spirit.</span></li>

<li><span>be attentive to me and hear me. I am grieved in my

<li><span>Cast down, O Lord, and divide their tongues; for I have

and the hills shall be girded about with joy,</span></li>

abound with corn: they shall shout, yea they shall sing a
hymn.</span></li>

<li><span>Unto the end, for them that shall be changed; for
David.</span></li>
<li><span>SAVE me, O God: for the waters are come in even unto my
soul.</span></li>
<li><span>I stick fast in the mire of the deep: and there is no
sure standing. I am come into the depth of the sea: and a tempest
hath overwhelmed me.</span></li>
<li><span>I have laboured with crying; my jaws are become hoarse:
my eyes have failed, whilst I hope in my God.</span></li>
<li><span>They are multiplied above the hairs of my head, who hate
me without cause. My enemies are grown strong who have wrongfully
persecuted me: then did I pay that which I took not
away.</span></li>
<li><span>O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my offences are
not hidden from thee:</span></li>
<li><span>Let not them be ashamed for me, who look for thee, O
Lord, the Lord of hosts. Let them not be confounded on my account,
who seek thee, O God of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath
covered my face.</span></li>
<li><span>I am become a stranger to my brethren, and an alien to
the sons of my mother.</span></li>
<li><span>For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up: and the
reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon
me.</span></li>

reproach to me.</span></li>

them.</span></li>
<li><span>They that sat in the gate spoke against me: and they that
drank wine made me their song.</span></li>
<li><span>But as for me, my prayer is to thee, O Lord; for the time
of thy good pleasure, O God. In the multitude of thy mercy hear me,
in the truth of thy salvation.</span></li>
<li><span>Draw me out of the mire, that I may not stick fast:
deliver me from them that hate me, and out of the deep
waters.</span></li>
<li><span>Let not the tempest of water drown me, nor the deep
swallow me up: and let not the pit shut her mouth upon
me.</span></li>
<li><span>Hear me, O Lord, for thy mercy is kind; look upon me
according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.</span></li>
<li><span>And turn not away thy face from thy servant: for I am in
trouble, hear me speedily.</span></li>
<li><span>Attend to my soul, and deliver it: save me because of my
enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou knowest my reproach, and my confusion, and my
shame.</span></li>
<li><span>In thy sight are all they that afflict me; my heart hath
expected reproach and misery. And I looked for one that would
grieve together with me, but there was none: and for one that would
comfort me, and I found none.</span></li>
<li><span>And they gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they
gave me vinegar to drink.</span></li>
<li><span>Let their table become as a snare before them, and a
recompense, and a stumblingblock.</span></li>
<li><span>Let their eyes be darkened that they see not; and their
back bend thou down always.</span></li>
<li><span>Pour out thy indignation upon them: and let thy wrathful
anger take hold of them.</span></li>
<li><span>Let their habitation be made desolate: and let there be
none to dwell in their tabernacles.</span></li>
<li><span>Because they have persecuted him whom thou hast smitten;
and they have added to the grief of my wounds.</span></li>
<li><span>Add thou iniquity upon their iniquity: and let them not
come into thy justice.</span></li>
<li><span>Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; and
with the just let them not be written.</span></li>
<li><span>But I am poor and sorrowful: thy salvation, O God, hath
set me up.</span></li>
<li><span>I will praise the name of God with a canticle: and I will
magnify him with praise.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall please God better than a young calf, that
bringeth forth horns and hoofs.</span></li>

shall live.</span></li>

his prisoners.</span></li>
<li><span>Let the heavens and the earth praise him; the sea, and
every thing that creepeth therein.</span></li>

strength in their stripes.</span></li>
<li><span>They are not in the labour of men: neither shall they be
scourged like other men. B Therefore pride hath held them fast:
they are covered with their iniquity and their
wickedness.</span></li>
<li><span>Their iniquity hath come forth, as it were from fatness:
they have passed into the affection of the heart.</span></li>
<li><span>They have thought and spoken wickedness: they have spoken
iniquity on high.</span></li>

tongue hath passed through the earth.</span></li>

hath been in the mornings.</span></li>

concerning their last ends.</span></li>

<li><span>I am become as a beast before thee: and I am always with
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast held me by my right hand; and by thy will thou

desire upon earth?</span></li>

<li><span>Unto the end, for Idithun, a psalm of Asaph.</span></li>
<li><span>I cried to the Lord with my voice; to God with my voice,
and he gave ear to me.</span></li>
<li><span>In the day of my trouble I sought God, with my hands
lifted up to him in the night, and I was not deceived. My soul
refused to be comforted:</span></li>
<li><span>I remembered God, and was delighted, and was exercised,
and my spirit swooned away.</span></li>
<li><span>My eyes prevented the watches: I was troubled, and I
spoke not.</span></li>
<li><span>I thought upon the days of old: and I had in my mind the
eternal years.</span></li>
<li><span>And I meditated in the night with my own heart: and I was
exercised and I swept my spirit.</span></li>
<li><span>Will God then cast off for ever? or will he never be more
favourable again?</span></li>
<li><span>Or will he cut off his mercy for ever, from generation to
generation?</span></li>
<li><span>Or will God forget to shew mercy? or will he in his anger
shut up his mercies?</span></li>
<li><span>And I said, Now have I begun: this is the change of the
right hand of the most High.</span></li>
<li><span>I remembered the works of the Lord: for I will be mindful
of thy wonders from the beginning.</span></li>

employed in thy inventions.</span></li>
<li><span>Thy way, O God, is in the holy place: who is the great
God like our God?</span></li>
<li><span>Thou art the God that dost wonders. Thou hast made thy
power known among the nations:</span></li>

of Jacob and of Joseph.</span></li>
<li><span>The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee: and they
were afraid, and the depths were troubled.</span></li>
<li><span>Great was the noise of the waters: the clouds sent out a
sound. For thy arrows pass:</span></li>
<li><span>the voice of thy thunder in a wheel. Thy lightnings
enlightened the world: the earth shook and trembled.</span></li>
<li><span>Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in many waters: and
thy footsteps shall not be known.</span></li>

<li><span>Understanding for Asaph. Attend, O my people, to my law:
incline your ears to the words of my mouth.</span></li>
<li><span>I will open my mouth in parables: I will utter
propositions from the beginning.</span></li>
<li><span>How great things have we heard and known, and our fathers
have told us.</span></li>
<li><span>They have not been hidden from their children, in another
generation. Declaring the praises of the Lord, and his powers, and
his wonders which he hath done.</span></li>
<li><span>And he set up a testimony in Jacob: and made a law in
Israel. How great things he commanded our fathers, that they should
make the same known to their children:</span></li>
<li><span>that another generation might know them. The children
that should be born and should rise up, and declare them to their
children.</span></li>
<li><span>That they may put their hope in God and may not forget
the works of God: and may seek his commandments.</span></li>
<li><span>That they may not become like their fathers, a perverse
end exasperating generation. A generation that set not their heart
aright: and whose spirit was not faithful to God.</span></li>
<li><span>The sons of Ephraim who bend and shoot with the bow: they
have turned back in the day of battle.</span></li>
<li><span>They kept not the covenant of God: and in his law they
would not walk.</span></li>
<li><span>And they forgot his benefits, and his wonders that he had
shewn them.</span></li>
<li><span>Wonderful things did he do in the sight of their fathers,
in the land of Egypt, in the field of Tanis.</span></li>
<li><span>He divided the sea and brought them through: and he made
the waters to stand as in a vessel.</span></li>
<li><span>And he conducted them with a cloud by day: and all the
night with a light of</span></li>
<li><span>He struck the rock in the wilderness: and gave them to
drink, as out of the great deep.</span></li>
<li><span>He brought forth water out of the rock: and made streams
run down as rivers.</span></li>
<li><span>And they added yet more sin against him: they provoked
the most High to wrath in the place without water.</span></li>
<li><span>And they tempted God in their hearts, by asking meat for
their desires.</span></li>
<li><span>And they spoke ill of God: they said: Can God furnish a
table in the wilderness?</span></li>
<li><span>Because he struck the rock, and the waters gushed out,
and the streams overflowed. Can he also give bread, or provide a
table for his people?</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore the Lord heard, and was angry: and a fire was
kindled against Jacob, and wrath came up against
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>Because they believed not in God: and trusted not in his
salvation.</span></li>
<li><span>And he had commanded the clouds from above, and had
opened the doors of heaven.</span></li>
<li><span>And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given
them the bread of heaven.</span></li>
<li><span>Man ate the bread of angels: he sent them provisions in
abundance.</span></li>
<li><span>He removed the south wind from heaven: and by his power
brought in the southwest wind.</span></li>
<li><span>And he rained upon them flesh as dust: and feathered
fowls like as the sand of the sea.</span></li>
<li><span>And they fell in the midst of their camp, round about
their pavilions.</span></li>
<li><span>So they did eat, and were filled exceedingly, and he gave
them their desire:</span></li>
<li><span>they were not defrauded of that which they craved. As yet
their meat was in their mouth:</span></li>
<li><span>and the wrath of God came upon them. And he slew the fat
ones amongst them, and brought down the chosen men of
Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>In all these things they sinned still: and they believed
not for his wondrous works.</span></li>
<li><span>And their days were consumed in vanity, and their years
in haste.</span></li>
<li><span>When he slew them, then they sought him: and they
returned, and came to him early in the morning.</span></li>
<li><span>And they remembered that God was their helper: and the
most high God their redeemer.</span></li>
<li><span>And they loved him with their mouth: and with their
tongue they lied unto him:</span></li>
<li><span>But their heart was not right with him: nor were they
counted faithful in his covenant.</span></li>
<li><span>But he is merciful, and will forgive their sins: and will
not destroy them. And many a time did he turn away his anger: and
did not kindle all his wrath.</span></li>
<li><span>And he remembered that they are flesh: a wind that goeth
and returneth not.</span></li>
<li><span>How often did they provoke him in the desert: and move
him to wrath in the place without water?</span></li>
<li><span>And they turned back and tempted God: and grieved the
holy one of Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>They remembered not his hand, in the day that he redeemed
them from the hand of him that afflicted them:</span></li>
<li><span>How he wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the
field of Tanis.</span></li>
<li><span>And he turned their rivers into blood, and their showers
that they might, not drink.</span></li>
<li><span>He sent amongst them divers sores of flies, which
devoured them: and frogs which destroyed them.</span></li>
<li><span>And he gave up their fruits to the blast, and their
labours to the locust.</span></li>
<li><span>And he destroyed their vineyards with hail, and their
mulberry trees with hoarfrost.</span></li>
<li><span>And he gave up their cattle to the hail, and their stock
to the fire.</span></li>
<li><span>And he sent upon them the wrath of his indignation:
indignation and wrath and trouble, which he sent by evil
angels.</span></li>
<li><span>He made a way for a path to his anger: he spared not
their souls from death, and their cattle he shut up in
death.</span></li>
<li><span>And he killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt: the
firstfruits of all their labour in the tabernacles of
Cham.</span></li>
<li><span>And he took away his own people as sheep: and guided them
in the wilderness like a flock.</span></li>
<li><span>And he brought them out in hope, and they feared not:
band the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</span></li>
<li><span>And he brought them into the mountain of his sanctuary:
the mountain which his right hand had purchased. And he cast out
the Gentiles before them: and by lot divided to them their land by
a line of distribution.</span></li>
<li><span>And he made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their
tabernacles.</span></li>
<li><span>Yet they tempted, and provoked the most high God: and
they kept not his testimonies.</span></li>
<li><span>And they turned away, and kept not the covenant: even
like their fathers they were turned aside as a crooked
bow.</span></li>
<li><span>They provoked him to anger on their hills: and moved him
to jealousy with their graven things.</span></li>
<li><span>God heard, and despised them, and he reduced Israel
exceedingly as it were to nothing.</span></li>
<li><span>And he put away the tabernacle of Silo, his tabernacle
where he dwelt among men.</span></li>
<li><span>And he delivered their strength into captivity: and their
beauty into the hands of the enemy.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shut up his people under the sword: and he
despised his inheritance.</span></li>
<li><span>Fire consumed their young men: and their maidens were not
lamented.</span></li>
<li><span>Their priests fell by the sword: and their widows did not
mourn.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord was awaked as one out of sleep, and like a
mighty man that hath been surfeited with wine.</span></li>
<li><span>And he smote his enemies on the hinder parts: he put them
to an everlasting reproach.</span></li>
<li><span>And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph: and chose not
the tribe of Ephraim:</span></li>
<li><span>But he chose the tribe of Juda, mount Sion which he
loved.</span></li>
<li><span>And he built his sanctuary as of unicorns, in the land
which he founded for ever.</span></li>
<li><span>And he chose his servant David, and took him from the
hocks of sheep: he brought him from following the ewes great with
young,</span></li>
<li><span>To feed Jacob his servant, and Israel his
inheritance.</span></li>
<li><span>And he fed them in the innocence of his heart: and
conducted them by the skilfulness of his hands.</span></li>

<li><span>I am counted among them that go down to the pit: I am

from thy hand.</span></li>
<li><span>They have laid me in the lower pit: in the dark places,
and in the shadow of death.</span></li>
<li><span>Thy wrath is strong over me: and all thy waves thou hast
brought in upon me.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast put away my acquaintance far from me: they have
set me an abomination to themselves. I was delivered up, and came
not forth:</span></li>
<li><span>my eyes languished through poverty. All the day I cried
to thee, O Lord: I stretched out my hands to thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? or shall physicians
raise to life, and give praise to thee?</span></li>
<li><span>Shall any one in the sepulchre declare thy mercy: and thy
truth in destruction?</span></li>
<li><span>Shall thy wonders be known in the dark; and thy justice
in the land of forgetfulness?</span></li>
<li><span>But I, O Lord, have cried to thee: and in the morning my
prayer shall prevent thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Lord, why castest thou off my prayer: why turnest thou
away thy face from me?</span></li>
<li><span>I am poor, and in labours from my youth: and being
exalted have been humbled and troubled.</span></li>
<li><span>Thy wrath hath come upon me: and thy terrors have

Mercy and truth shall go before thy face:</span></li>

I have laid help upon one that is mighty, and have exalted one
chosen out of my people.</span></li>
<li><span>I have found David my servant: with my holy oil I have
anointed him.</span></li>
<li><span>For my hand shall help him: and my arm shall strengthen

<li><span>He shall cry out to me: Thou art my father: my God, and

proceed from my mouth I will not make void.</span></li>

perfect for ever, and a faithful witness in heaven.</span></li>
<li><span>But thou hast rejected and despised: thou hast been angry
with thy anointed.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast overthrown the covenant of thy servant: thou
hast profaned his sanctuary on the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast broken down all his hedges: thou hast made his
strength fear.</span></li>
<li><span>All that pass by the way have robbed him: he is become a
reproach to his neighbours.</span></li>

<li><span>A psalm for David himself. Mercy and judgment I will sing
to thee, O Lord: I will sing,</span></li>

shalt come to me. I walked in the innocence of my heart, in the
midst of my house.</span></li>
<li><span>I did not set before my eyes any unjust thing: I hated
the workers of iniquities.</span></li>
<li><span>The perverse heart did not cleave to me: and the
malignant, that turned aside from me, I would not know.</span></li>
<li><span>The man that in private detracted his neighbour, him did
I persecute. With him that had a proud eye, and an unsatiable

me: the man that walked in the perfect way, he served
me.</span></li>

his praise in Jerusalem;</span></li>

<li><span>Bringing forth grass for cattle, and herb for the service
of men. That thou mayst bring bread out of the earth:</span></li>

make the face cheerful with oil: and that bread may strengthen
man's heart.</span></li>

their meat from God.</span></li>
<li><span>The sun ariseth, and they are gathered together: and they

troubled: thou shalt take away their breath, and they shall fail,
and shall return to their dust.</span></li>

devils.</span></li>

<li><span>Arise, my glory; arise, psaltery and harp: I will arise
in the morning early.</span></li>

<li><span>Galaad is mine, and Manasses is mine and Ephraim the

<li><span>Unto the end, a psalm for David.</span></li>
<li><span>O God, be not thou silent in thy praise: for the mouth of
the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful man is opened against
me.</span></li>
<li><span>They have spoken against with deceitful tongues; and they
have compassed me about with words of hatred; and have fought
against me without cause.</span></li>
<li><span>Instead of making me a return of love, they detracted me:
but I gave myself to prayer.</span></li>
<li><span>And they repaid me evil for good: and hatred for my
love.</span></li>
<li><span>Set thou the sinner over him: and may the devil stand at
his right hand.</span></li>
<li><span>When he is judged, may he go out condemned; and may his
prayer be turned to sin.</span></li>
<li><span>May his days be few: and his bishopric let another
take.</span></li>
<li><span>May his children be fatherless, and his wife a
widow.</span></li>
<li><span>Let his children be carried about vagabonds, and beg; and
let them be cast out of their dwellings.</span></li>
<li><span>May the userer search all his substance: and let
strangers plunder his labours.</span></li>
<li><span>May there be none to help him: nor none to pity his
fatherless offspring.</span></li>

name be blotted out.</span></li>
<li><span>May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered in the
sight of the Lord: and let not the sin of his mother be blotted
out.</span></li>
<li><span>May they be before the lord continually, and let the
memory of them perish from the earth:</span></li>
<li><span>because he remembered not to show mercy,</span></li>
<li><span>But persecuted the poor man and the beggar; and the
broken in heart, to put him to death.</span></li>
<li><span>And he loved cursing, and it shall come unto him: and he
would not have blessing, and it shall be far from him. And he put
on cursing, like a garment: and it went in like water into his
entrails, and like oil in his bones.</span></li>
<li><span>May it be unto him like a garment which covereth him; and
like a girdle with which he is girded continually.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the work of them who detract me before the Lord;
and who speak evils against my soul.</span></li>
<li><span>But thou, O Lord, do with for thy names sake: because thy
mercy is sweet. Do thou deliver me.</span></li>
<li><span>for I am poor and needy, and my heart is troubled within
me.</span></li>
<li><span>I am taken away like the shadow when it declineth: and I
am shaken off as locusts.</span></li>
<li><span>My knees are weakened through fasting: and my flesh is
changed for oil.</span></li>
<li><span>And I am become a reproach to them: they saw me and they
shaked their heads,</span></li>
<li><span>Help me, O Lord my God; save me according to thy
mercy.</span></li>
<li><span>And let them know that this is thy hand: and that thou, O
Lord, hast done it.</span></li>

up against me be confounded: but thy servant shall
rejoice.</span></li>
<li><span>Let them that detract me be clothed with shame: and let
them be covered with the their confusion as with a double
cloak.</span></li>
<li><span>I will give great thanks to the Lord with my mouth: and
in the midst of many I will praise him.</span></li>

judgment of them that love thy name.</span></li>
<li><span>Direct my steps according to thy word: and let no
iniquity have dominion over me.</span></li>
<li><span>Redeem me from the calumnies of men: that I may keep thy
commandments.</span></li>

quicken me according to thy mercy.</span></li>
<li><span>They that persecute me have drawn nigh to iniquity; but
they are gone far off from the law.</span></li>

truth.</span></li>

have not declined from thy testimonies.</span></li>

commandments are justice.</span></li>
