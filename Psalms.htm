Their throat is an open sepulchre: with their tongues they acted deceitfully; the poison of asps is under their lips. Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness; their feet are swift to shed blood. Destruction and unhappiness in their ways: and the way of peace they have not known: there is no fear of God before their eyes.<li>Shall not all they know that work iniquity, who devour my people as they eat bread ?<li>They have not called upon the Lord: there have they trembled for fear, where there was no fear.<li>For the Lord is in the just generation: you have confounded the counsel of the poor man, but the Lord is his hope.<li>Who shall give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? when the Lord shall have turned away the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice and Israel shall be glad.</ol><h2><a name=15>Psalms 15</a></h2><ol><li>A psalm of David.

He that sweareth to his neighbour, and deceiveth not;<li>he that hath not put out his money to usury, nor taken bribes against the innocent: He that doth these things shall not be moved for ever.</ol><h2><a name=16>Psalms 16</a></h2><ol><li>The inscription of a title to David himself. Preserve me, O Lord, for I have put trust in thee.<li>I have said to the Lord, thou art my God, for thou hast no need of my goods.<li>To the saints, who are in his land, he hath made wonderful all my desires in them.<li>Their infirmities were multiplied: afterwards they made haste. I will not gather together their meetings for blood offerings: nor will I be mindful of their names by my lips.<li>The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup: it is thou that wilt restore my inheritance to me.<li>The lines are fallen unto me in goodly places: for my inheritance is goodly to me.<li>I will bless the Lord, who hath given me understanding: moreover my reins also have corrected me even till night.<li>I set the Lord always in my sight: for he is at my right hand, that I be not moved.<li>Therefore my heart hath been glad, and my tongue hath rejoiced: moreover my flesh also shall rest in hope.<li>Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; nor wilt then give thy holy one to see corruption.<li>Thou hast made known to me the ways of life, thou shalt fill me with joy with thy countenance: at thy right hand are delights even to the end.</ol><h2><a name=17>Psalms 17</a></h2><ol><li>The prayer of David.

Protect me under the shadow of thy wings.<li>From the face of the wicked who have afflicted me. My enemies have surrounded my soul:<li>they have shut up their fat: their mouth hath spoken proudly.<li>They have cast me forth and now they have surrounded me: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth.<li>They have taken me, as a lion prepared for the prey; and as a young lion dwelling in secret places.<li>Arise, O Lord, disappoint him and supplant him; deliver my soul from the wicked one: thy sword<li>from the enemies of thy hand. O Lord, divide them from the few of the earth in their life: their belly is filled from thy hidden stores.
