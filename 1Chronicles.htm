And the Lord said to him: Go up, and I will deliver them into thy hand.<li>And when they were come to Baalpharasim, David defeated them there, and he said: God hath divided my enemies by my hand, as waters are divided: and therefore the name of that place was called Baalpharasim.<li>And they left there their gods, and David commanded that they should be burnt.<li>Another time also the Philistines made an irruption, and spread themselves abroad in the valley.<li>And David consulted God again, and God said to him: Go not up after them, turn away from them, and come upon them over against the pear trees.<li>And when thou shalt hear the sound of one going in the tops of the pear trees, then shalt thou go out to battle. For God is gone out before thee to strike the army of the Philistines.<li>And David did as God had commanded him, and defeated the army of the Philistines, slaying them from Gabaon to Gazera.<li>And

for it:<li>Lest as the Lord at first struck us, because you were not present, the same should now also come to pass, by our doing some thing against the law.<li>So the priests and the Levites were sanctified, to carry the ark of the Lord the God of Israel.<li>And the sons of Levi took the ark of God as Moses had commanded, according to the word of the Lord, upon their shoulders, with the staves.<li>And David spoke to the chiefs of the Levites, to appoint some of their brethren to be singers with musical instruments, to wit, on psalteries, and harps, and cymbals, that the joyful noise

I give the land of Chanaan: the lot of your inheritance.<li>When they were but a small number: very few and sojourners in it.<li>And they passed from nation to nation: and from a kingdom to another

ye to the Lord glory and empire.<li>Give to the Lord glory to his name, bring up sacrifice, and come ye in his sight: and adore the Lord in holy becomingness.<li>Let all the earth be moved at his presence : for he hath founded the world immoveable.<li>Let the heavens rejoice, and the earth be glad: and let them say among the nations: The Lord hath reigned.<li>Let the sea roar, and the fulness

the Lord: Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in.<li>For I have not remained in a house from the time that I brought up Israel, to this day: but I have been always changing places in a tabernacle, and in a tent,<li>Abiding with all Israel.

And all the assembly blessed the Lord the God of their fathers: and they bowed themselves and worshipped God, and then the king.<li>And they sacrificed victims to the Lord: and they offered holocausts the next day, a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs, with their libations, and with every thing prescribed most abundantly for all Israel.<li>And they ate, and drank before the Lord that day with great joy. And they anointed the second time Solomon the son of David. And they anointed him to the Lord to be prince, end Sadoc to be high priest.<li>And Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king instead of David his father, and he pleased all: and all Israel obeyed him.<li>And all the princes, and men of power, and all the sons of king David gave their hand, and were subject to Solomon the king.<li>And the Lord magnified Solomon over all Israel: and gave him the glory of a reign, such as no king of Israel had before him.<li>So David the son of Isai reigned over all Israel.<li>And the days that he reigned over Israel, were forty years: in Hebron he reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem three and thirty years.<li>And he died in a good age, full of days, and riches, and glory. And Solomon his son reigned in his stead.<li>Now the acts of king David first and last are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer:<li>And of all his reign, and his valour, and of the times that passed under him, either in Israel, or in all the kingdoms of the countries.</ol></body></html>
