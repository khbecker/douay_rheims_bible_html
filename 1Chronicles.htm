    <li><span>Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the
    men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down
    wounded in mount Gelboe.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Philistines drew near pursuing after Saul,
    and his sons, and they killed Jonathan, and Abinadab, and
    Melchisua the sons of Saul.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the battle grew hard against Saul, and the
    archers reached him, and wounded him with arrows.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Saul said to his armourbearer: Draw thy sword,
    and kill me: lest these uncircumcised come, and mock me. But
    his armourbearer would not, for he was struck with fear: so
    Saul took his sword, and fell upon it.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when his armourbearer saw it, to wit, that Saul
    was dead, he also fell upon his sword and died.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house
    fell together.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the men of Israel, that dwelt in the plains,
    saw this, they fled: and Saul and his sons being dead, they
    forsook their cities, and were scattered up and down: and the
    Philistines came, and dwelt in them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the next day the Philistines taking away the
    spoils of them that were slain, found Saul and his sons lying
    on mount Gelboe.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they had stripped him, and cut off his head,
    and taken away his armour, they sent it into their land, to be
    carried about, and shewn in the temples of the idols and to the
    people.</span></li>

    <li><span>And his armour they dedicated in the temple of their
    god, and his head they fastened up in the temple of
    Dagon.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the men of Jabes Galaad had heard this, to
    wit, all that the Philistines had done to Saul,</span></li>

    <li><span>All the valiant men of them arose, and took the
    bodies of Saul and of his sons, and brought them to Jabes, and
    buried their bones under the oak that was in Jabes, and they
    fasted seven days.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Saul died for his iniquities, because he
    transgressed the commandment of the Lord, which he had
    commanded, and kept it not: and moreover consulted also a
    witch,</span></li>

    <li><span>And trusted not is the Lord: therefore he slew him,
    and transferred his kingdom to David the son of
    Isai.</span></li>

  <h2><a name="11">1 Paralipomenon 11</a></h2>

    <li><span>Then all Israel gathered themselves to David in
    Hebron, saying: We are thy bone, and thy flesh.</span></li>

    <li><span>Yesterday also, and the day before when Saul was
    king, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel:
    for the Lord thy God said to thee: Thou shalt feed my people
    Israel, and thou shalt; be ruler over them.</span></li>

    <li><span>So all the ancients of Israel came to the king to
    Hebron, and David made a covenant with them before the Lord:
    and they anointed him king over Israel, according to the word
    of the Lord which he spoke in the hand of Samuel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is
    Jebus, where the Jebusites were the inhabitants of the
    land.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David: Thou
    shalt not come in here. But David took the castle of Sion,
    which is the city of David.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said: Whosoever shall first strike the
    Jebusites, shall be the head and chief captain. And Joab the
    son of Sarvia went up first, and was made the
    general.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David dwelt in the castle, and therefore it was
    called the city of David.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he built the city round about from Mello all
    round, and Joab built the rest of the city.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David went on growing and increasing, and the
    Lord of hosts was with him.</span></li>

    <li><span>These are the chief of the valiant men of David, who
    helped him to be made king over all Israel, according to the
    word of the Lord, which he spoke to Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And this is the number of the heroes of David:
    Jesbaam the son of Hachamoni the chief among the thirty: he
    lifted up his spear against three hundred wounded by him at one
    time.</span></li>

    <li><span>And after him was Eleazar his uncle's son the
    Ahohite, who was one of the three mighties.</span></li>

    <li><span>He was with David in Phesdomim, when the Philistines
    were gathered to that place to battle: and the field of that
    country was full of barley, and the people fled from before the
    Philistines.</span></li>

    <li><span>But these men stood in the midst of the field, and
    defended it: and they slew the Philistines, and the Lord gave a
    great deliverance to his people.</span></li>

    <li><span>And three of the thirty captains went down to the
    rock, wherein David was, to the cave of Odollam, when the
    Philistines encamped in the valley of Raphaim.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David was in a hold, and the garrison of the
    Philistines in Bethlehem.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David longed, and said: O that some man would
    give me water of the cistern of Bethlehem, which is in the
    gate.</span></li>

    <li><span>And these three broke through the midst of the camp
    of the Philistines, and drew water out of the cistern of
    Bethlehem, which was in the gate, and brought it to David to
    drink: and he would not drink of it, but rather offered it to
    the Lord,</span></li>

    <li><span>Saying: God forbid that I should do this in the sight
    of my God, and should drink the blood of these men: for with
    the danger of their lives they have brought me the water. And
    therefore he would not drink. These things did the three most
    valiant.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Abisai the brother of Joab, he was chief of
    three, and he lifted up his spear against three hundred whom he
    slew, and he was renowned among the three,</span></li>

    <li><span>And illustrious among the second three, and their
    captain: but yet he attained not to the first
    three.</span></li>

    <li><span>Banaias the son of Joiada, a most valiant man, of
    Cabseel, who had done many acts: he slew the two ariels of
    Moab: and he went down, and killed a lion in the midst of a pit
    in the time of snow.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he slew an Egyptian, whose stature was of five
    cubits, and who had a spear like a weaver's beam: and he went
    down to him with a staff, and plucked away the spear, that he
    held in his hand, and slew him with his own spear.</span></li>

    <li><span>These things did Banaias the son of Joiada, who was
    renowned among the three valiant ones,</span></li>

    <li><span>And the first among the thirty, but yet to the three
    he attained not: and David made him of his council.</span></li>

    <li><span>Moreover the most valiant men of the army, were

    <li><span>From Gaddi also there went over to David, when he lay
    hid in the wilderness most valiant men, and excellent warriors,
    holding shield and spear: whose faces were like the faces of a

    <li><span>These are they who passed over the Jordan in the
    first month, when it is used to how over its banks: and they
    put to flight all that dwelt in the valleys both toward the

    <li><span>And there came also of the men of Benjamin, and of

    <li><span>Moreover day by day there came some to David to help
    him till they became a great number, like the army of
    God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And this is the number of the chiefs of the army who
    came to David, when he was in Hebron, to transfer to him the
    kingdom of Saul, according to the word of the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Juda bearing shield and spear, six
    thousand eight hundred well appointed to war.</span></li>

    <li><span>Of the sons of Simeon valiant men for war, seven
    thousand one hundred.</span></li>

    <li><span>Of the sons of Levi, four thousand six
    hundred.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Joiada prince of the race of Aaron, and with him
    three thousand seven hundred.</span></li>

    <li><span>Sadoc also a young man of excellent disposition, and
    the house of his father, twenty-two principal men.</span></li>

    <li><span>And of the sons of Benjamin the brethren of Saul,
    three thousand: for hitherto a great part of them followed the
    house of Saul.</span></li>

    <li><span>And of the sons of Ephraim twenty thousand eight
    hundred, men of great valour renowned in their
    kindreds.</span></li>

    <li><span>And of the half tribe of Manasses, eighteen thousand,
    every one by their names, came to make David king.</span></li>

    <li><span>Also of the sons of Issachar men of understanding,
    that knew all times to order what Israel should do, two hundred
    principal men: and all the rest of the tribe followed their
    counsel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And of Zabulon such as went forth to battle, and
    stood in array well appointed with armour for war, there came
    fifty thousand to his aid, with no double heart.</span></li>

    <li><span>And of Nephtali, a thousand leaders: and with them
    seven and thirty thousand, furnished with shield and
    spear.</span></li>

    <li><span>Of Dan also twenty-eight thousand six hundred
    prepared for battle.</span></li>

    <li><span>And of Aser forty thousand going forth to fight, and
    challenging in battle.</span></li>

    <li><span>And on the other side of the Jordan of the sons of
    Ruben, and of Gad, and of the half of the tribe of Manasses a
    hundred and twenty thousand, furnished with arms for
    war.</span></li>

    <li><span>All these men of war well appointed to fight, came
    with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all
    Israel: and all the rest also of Israel, were of one heart to
    make David king.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they were there with David three days eating and
    drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.</span></li>

    <li><span>Moreover they that were near them even as far as
    Issachar, and Zabulon, and Nephtali, brought leaves on asses,
    and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, to eat: meal, figs,
    raisins, wine, oil, and oxen, and sheep in abundance, for there
    was joy in Israel.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="13">1 Paralipomenon 13</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And David consulted with the captains of thousands,
    and of hundreds, and with all the commanders.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to all the assembly of Israel: If it
    please you; and if the words which I speak come from the Lord
    our God, let us send to the rest of our brethren into all the
    countries of Israel, and to the priests, and the Levites, that
    dwell in the suburbs of the cities, to gather themselves to
    us,</span></li>

    <li><span>And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for
    we sought it not in the days of Saul.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the multitude answered that it should be so:
    for the word pleased all the people.</span></li>

    <li><span>So David assembled all Israel from Sihor of Egypt,
    even to the entering into Emath, to bring the ark of God from
    Cariathiarim.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David went up with all the men of Israel to the
    hill of Cariathiarim which is in Juda, to bring thence the ark
    of the Lord God sitting upon the cherubims, where his name is
    called upon.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they carried the ark of God upon a new cart, out
    of the house of Abinadab. And Oza and his brother drove the
    cart.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David and all Israel played before God with all
    their might with hymns, and with harps, and with psalteries,
    and timbrels, and cymbals, and trumpets,</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they came to the floor of Chidon, Oza put
    forth his hand, to hold up the ark: for the ox being wanton had
    made it lean a little on one side.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord was angry with Oza, and struck him,
    because he had touched the ark; and he died there before the
    Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David was troubled because the Lord had divided
    Oza: and he called that place the Breach of Oza to this
    day.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he feared God at that time, saying: How can I
    bring in the ark of God to me?</span></li>

    <li><span>And therefore he brought it not home to himself, that
    is, into the city of David, but carried it aside into the house
    of Obededom the Gethite.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the ark of God remained in the house of Obededom
    three months: and the Lord blessed his house, and all that he
    had.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="14">1 Paralipomenon 14</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and
    cedar trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him a
    house.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David perceived that the Lord had confirmed him
    king over Israel, and that his kingdom was exalted over his
    people Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David took other wives in Jerusalem: and he beget
    sons, and daughters.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now these are the names of them that were born to him
    in Jerusalem: Samua, and Sobad, Nathan, and
    Solomon,</span></li>

    <li><span>Jebahar, and Elisua, and Eliphalet,</span></li>

    <li><span>And Noga, and Napheg, and Japhia,</span></li>

    <li><span>Elisama. and Baaliada, and Eliphalet.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Philistines hearing that David was anointed
    king over all Israel, went all up to seek him: and David heard
    of it, and went out against them.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the
    vale of Raphaim.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David consulted the Lord, saying: Shall I go up
    against the Philistines, and wilt thou deliver them into my
    hand? And the Lord said to him: Go up, and I will deliver them
    into thy hand.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they were come to Baalpharasim, David
    defeated them there, and he said: God hath divided my enemies
    by my hand, as waters are divided: and therefore the name of
    that place was called Baalpharasim.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they left there their gods, and David commanded
    that they should be burnt.</span></li>

    <li><span>Another time also the Philistines made an irruption,
    and spread themselves abroad in the valley.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David consulted God again, and God said to him:
    Go not up after them, turn away from them, and come upon them
    over against the pear trees.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when thou shalt hear the sound of one going in
    the tops of the pear trees, then shalt thou go out to battle.
    For God is gone out before thee to strike the army of the
    Philistines.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David did as God had commanded him, and defeated
    the army of the Philistines, slaying them from Gabaon to
    Gazera.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the name of David became famous in all countries,
    and the Lord made all nations fear him.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="15">1 Paralipomenon 15</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>He made also houses for himself in the city of David:
    and built a place for the ark of God, and pitched a tabernacle
    for it.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then David said: No one ought to carry the ark of
    God, but the Levites, whom the Lord hath chosen to carry it,
    and to minister unto himself for ever.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he gathered all Israel together into Jerusalem,
    that the ark of God might be brought into its place, which he
    had prepared for it.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the sons of Aaron also, and the
    Levites.</span></li>

    <li><span>Of the children of Caath, Uriel was the chief, and
    his brethren a hundred and twenty.</span></li>

    <li><span>Of the sons of Merari, Asaia the chief, and his
    brethren two hundred and twenty.</span></li>

    <li><span>Of the sons of Gersom, Joel the chief, and his
    brethren a hundred and thirty.</span></li>

    <li><span>Of the sons of Elisaphan, Semeias the chief: and his
    brethren two hundred.</span></li>

    <li><span>Of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief: and his
    brethren eighty.</span></li>

    <li><span>Of the sons of Oziel, Aminadab the chief: and his
    brethren a hundred and twelve.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David called Sadoc, and Abiathar the priests, and
    the Levites, Uriel, Asaia, Joel, Semeia, Eliel, and
    Aminadab:</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to them: You that are the heads of the
    Levitical families, be sanctified with your brethren, and brine
    the ark of the Lord the God of Israel to the place, which is
    prepared for it:</span></li>

    <li><span>Lest as the Lord at first struck us, because you were
    not present, the same should now also come to pass, by our
    doing some thing against the law.</span></li>

    <li><span>So the priests and the Levites were sanctified, to
    carry the ark of the Lord the God of Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the sons of Levi took the ark of God as Moses had
    commanded, according to the word of the Lord, upon their
    shoulders, with the staves.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David spoke to the chiefs of the Levites, to
    appoint some of their brethren to be singers with musical
    instruments, to wit, on psalteries, and harps, and cymbals,
    that the joyful noise might resound on high.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they appointed Levites, Hemam the son of Joel,
    and of his brethren Asaph the son of Barachias: and of the sons
    of Merari, their brethren: Ethan the son of Casaia.</span></li>

    <li><span>And with them their brethren: in the second rank,
    Zacharias, and Ben, and Jaziel, and Semiramoth, and Jahiel, and
    Ani, and Eliab, and Banaias, and Maasias, and Mathathias, and
    Eliphalu, and Macenias, and Obededom, and Jehiel, the
    porters.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, sounded
    with cymbals of brass.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Zacharias, and Oziel, and Semiramoth, and Jehiel,
    and Ani, and Eliab, and Maasias, and Banaias, sung mysteries
    upon psalteries.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Mathathias, and Eliphalu, and Macenias and
    Obededom, and Jehiel and Ozaziu, sung a song of victory for the
    octave upon harps.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Chonenias chief of the Levites, presided over the
    prophecy, to give out the tunes: for he was very
    skilful.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Barachias, and Elcana, were doorkeepers of the
    ark.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Sebenias, and Josaphat, and Nathanael, and
    Amasai, and Zacharias, and Banaias, and Eliezer the priests,
    sounded with trumpets, before the ark of God: and Obededom and
    Jehias were porters of the ark.</span></li>

    <li><span>So David and all the ancients of Israel, and the
    captains over thousands, went to bring the ark of the covenant
    of the Lord out of the house of Obededom with joy.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when God had helped the Levites who carried the
    ark of the covenant of the Lord, they offered in sacrifice
    seven oxen, and seven rams.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and
    all the Levites that carried the ark, and the singing men, and
    Chonenias the ruler of the prophecy among the singers: and
    David also had on him an ephod of linen.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all Israel brought the ark of the covenant of the
    Lord with joyful shouting, and sounding with the sound of the
    comet, and with trumpets, and cymbals, and psalteries, and
    harps.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the ark of the covenant of the Lord was come
    to the city of David, Michol the daughter of Saul looking out
    at a window, saw king David dancing and playing, and she
    despised him in her heart.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="16">1 Paralipomenon 16</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the
    midst of the tent, which David had pitched for it : and they
    offered holocausts, and peace offerings before God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when David had made an end of offering
    holocausts, and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the
    name of the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he divided to all and every one, both men and
    women, a loaf of bread, and a piece of roasted beef, and flour
    fried with oil.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he appointed Levites to minister before the ark
    of the Lord, and to remember his works, and to glorify, and
    praise the Lord God of Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>Asaph the chief, and next after him Zacharias:
    moreover Jahiel, and Semiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mathathias,
    and Eliab, and Banaias, and Obededom: and Jehiel over the
    instruments of psaltery, and harps: and Asaph sounded with
    cymbals:</span></li>

    <li><span>But Banaias, and Jaziel the priests, to sound the
    trumpet continually before the ark of the covenant of the
    Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>In that day David made Asaph the chief to give praise
    to the Lord with his brethren.</span></li>

    <li><span>Praise ye the Lord, and call upon his name: make
    known his doings among the nations.</span></li>

    <li><span>Sing to him, yea, sing praises to him: and relate all
    his wondrous works.</span></li>

    <li><span>Praise ye his holy name: let the heart I of them
    rejoice, that seek the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>Seek ye the Lord, and his power: seek ye his face
    evermore.</span></li>

    <li><span>Remember his wonderful works, which he hath done: his
    signs, and the judgments of his mouth.</span></li>

    <li><span>O ye seed of Israel his servants, ye children of
    Jacob his chosen.</span></li>

    <li><span>He is the Lord our God: his judgments are in all the
    earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>Remember for ever his covenant: the word, which he
    commanded to a thousand generations.</span></li>

    <li><span>The covenant which he made with Abraham: and his oath
    to Isaac.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he appointed the same to Jacob for a precept: and
    to Israel for an everlasting covenant:</span></li>

    <li><span>Saying: To thee will I give the land of Chanaan: the
    lot of your inheritance.</span></li>

    <li><span>When they were but a small number: very few and
    sojourners in it.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they passed from nation to nation: and from a
    kingdom to another people.</span></li>

    <li><span>He suffered no man to do them wrong: and reproved
    kings for their sake.</span></li>

    <li><span>Touch not my anointed: and do no evil to my
    prophets.</span></li>

    <li><span>Sing ye to the Lord, all the earth: shew forth from
    day to day his salvation.</span></li>

    <li><span>Declare his glory among the Gentiles: his wonders
    among all people.</span></li>

    <li><span>For the Lord is great and exceedingly to be praised:
    and he is to be feared above all gods.</span></li>

    <li><span>For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the
    Lord made the heavens.</span></li>

    <li><span>Praise and magnificence are before him: strength and
    joy in his place.</span></li>

    <li><span>Bring ye to the Lord, O ye families of the nations:
    bring ye to the Lord glory and empire.</span></li>

    <li><span>Give to the Lord glory to his name, bring up
    sacrifice, and come ye in his sight: and adore the Lord in holy
    becomingness.</span></li>

    <li><span>Let all the earth be moved at his presence : for he
    hath founded the world immoveable.</span></li>

    <li><span>Let the heavens rejoice, and the earth be glad: and
    let them say among the nations: The Lord hath
    reigned.</span></li>

    <li><span>Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the
    fields rejoice, and all things that are in them.</span></li>

    <li><span>Then shall the trees of the wood give praise before
    the Lord: because he is come to judge the earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>Give ye glory to the Lord, for he is good: for his
    mercy endureth for ever.</span></li>

    <li><span>And say ye: Save us, O God our saviour: and gather us
    together, and deliver us from the nations, that we may give
    glory to thy holy name, and may rejoice in singing thy
    praises.</span></li>

    <li><span>Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel from eternity
    to eternity: and let all the people say Amen, and a hymn to
    God.</span></li>

    <li><span>So he left there before the ark of the covenant of
    the Lord, Asaph and his brethren to minister in the presence of
    the ark continually day by day, and in their
    courses.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Obededom, with his brethren sixty-eight: and
    Obededom the son of Idithun, and Hosa he appointed to be
    porters.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Sadoc the priest, and his brethren priests,
    before the tabernacle of the Lord in the high place, which was
    in Gabaon.</span></li>

    <li><span>That they should offer holocausts to the Lord upon
    the altar of holocausts continually, morning and evening,
    according to all that is written in the law of the Lord, which
    he commanded Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And after him Heman, and Idithun, and the rest that
    were chosen, every one by his name to give praise to the Lord:
    because his mercy endureth for ever.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Heman and Idithun sounded the trumpet, and played
    on the cymbals, and all kinds of musical instruments to sing
    praises to God: and the sons of Idithun he made
    porters.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the people returned to their houses: and
    David to bless also his own house.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="17">1 Paralipomenon 17</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Now when David was dwelling in his house, he said to
    Nathan the prophet: Behold I dwell in a house of cedar : and
    the ark of the covenant of the Lord is under skins.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Nathan said to David: Do all that is in thy
    heart: for God is with thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now that night the word of God came to Nathan,
    saying:</span></li>

    <li><span>Go, and speak to David my servant: Thus saith the
    Lord: Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in.</span></li>

    <li><span>For I have not remained in a house from the time that
    I brought up Israel, to this day: but I have been always
    changing places in a tabernacle, and in a tent,</span></li>

    <li><span>Abiding with all Israel. Did I ever speak to any one,
    of all the judges of Israel, whom I charged to feed my people,
    saying: Why have you not built me a house of cedar?</span></li>

    <li><span>Now therefore thus shalt thou say to my servant
    David: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I took thee from the
    pastures, from following the flock, that thou shouldst be ruler
    of my people Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast
    gone: and have slain all thy enemies before thee, and have made
    thee a name like that of one of the great ones that are
    renowned in the earth.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I have given a place to my people Israel: they
    shall be planted, and shall dwell therein, and shall be moved
    no more, neither shall the children of iniquity waste them, as
    at the beginning,</span></li>

    <li><span>Since the days that I gave judges to my people
    Israel, and have humbled all thy enemies. And I declare to
    thee, that the Lord will build thee a house.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when thou shalt have ended thy days to go to thy
    fathers, I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of
    thy sons: and I will establish his kingdom.</span></li>

    <li><span>He shall build me a house, and I will establish his
    throne for ever.</span></li>

    <li><span>I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a
    son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it
    from him that was before thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>But I will settle him in my house, and in my kingdom
    for ever: and his throne shall be most firm for
    ever.</span></li>

    <li><span>According to all these words, and according to all
    this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.</span></li>

    <li><span>And king David came and sat before the Lord, and
    said: Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house, that thou
    shouldst give such things to me?</span></li>

    <li><span>But even this hath seemed little in thy sight, and
    therefore thou hast also spoken concerning the house of thy
    servant for the time to come: and best made me remarkable above
    all men, O Lord God.</span></li>

    <li><span>What can David add more, seeing thou hast thus
    glorified thy servant, and known him?</span></li>

    <li><span>O Lord, for thy servant's sake, according to thy own
    heart, thou hast shewn all this magnificence, and wouldst have
    all the great things to be known.</span></li>

    <li><span>O Lord there is none like thee: and there is no other
    God beside thee, of all whom we have heard of with our
    ears.</span></li>

    <li><span>For what other nation is there upon earth like thy
    people Israel, whom God went to deliver, and make a people for
    himself, and by his greatness and terrors cast out nations
    before their face whom he had delivered out of
    Egypt?</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou hast made thy people Israel to be thy own
    people for ever, and thou, O Lord, art become their
    God.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now therefore, O Lord, let the word which thou hast
    spoken to thy servant, and concerning his house, be established
    for ever, and do as thou hast said.</span></li>

    <li><span>And let thy name remain and be magnified for ever:
    and let it be said: The Lord of hosts is God of Israel, and the
    house of David his servant remaineth before him.</span></li>

    <li><span>For thou, O Lord my God, hast revealed to the ear of
    thy servant, that thou wilt build him a house: and therefore
    thy servant hath found confidence to pray before
    thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>And now O Lord, thou art God: and thou hast promised
    to thy servant such great benefits.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou hast begun to bless the house of thy
    servant, that it may be always before thee: for seeing thou
    blessest it, O Lord, it shall be blessed for ever.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he put a garrison in Damascus, that Syria also
    should serve him, and bring gifts. And the Lord assisted him in
    all things to which he went.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David took the golden quivers which the servants
    of Adarezer had, and he brought them to Jerusalem.</span></li>

    <li><span>Likewise out of Thebath and Chun, cities of Adarezer,
    he brought very much brass, of which Solomon made the brazen
    sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now when Thou king of Hemath heard that David had
    defeated all the army of Adarezer king of Soba,</span></li>

    <li><span>He sent Adoram his son to king David, to desire peace
    of him, and to congratulate him that he had defeated and
    overthrown Adarezer: for Thou was an enemy to
    Adarezer.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the vessels of gold, and silver, and brass
    king David consecrated to the Lord, with the silver and gold
    which he had taken from all the nations, as well from Edom, and
    from Moab, and from the sons of Ammon, as from the Philistines,
    and from Amalec.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Abisai the son of Sarvia slew of the Edomites in
    the vale of the saltpits, eighteen thousand:</span></li>

    <li><span>And he put a garrison in Edom, that Edom should serve
    David: and the Lord preserved David in all things to which he
    went.</span></li>

    <li><span>So David reigned over all Israel, and executed
    judgment and justice among all his people.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Joab the son of Sarvia was over the army, and
    Josaphat the son of Ahilud recorder.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Sadoc the son of Achitob, and Achimelech the son
    of Abiathar, were the priests: and Susa, scribe.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Banaias the son of Joiada was over the bands of
    the Cerethi, and the Phelethi: and the sons of David were chief
    about the king.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="19">1 Paralipomenon 19</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Now it came to pass that Naas the king of the
    children of Ammon died, and his son reigned is his
    stead.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David said: I will shew kindness to Hanon the son
    of Naas: for his father did a favour to me. And David sent
    messengers to comfort him upon the death of his father. But
    when they were come into the land of the children of Ammon, to
    comfort Hanon,</span></li>

    <li><span>The princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanon:
    Thou thinkest perhaps that David to do honour to thy father
    hath sent comforters to thee: and thou dost not take notice,
    that his servants are come to thee to consider, and search, and
    spy out thy land.</span></li>

    <li><span>Wherefore Hanon shaved the heads and beards of the
    servants of David, and cut away their garments from the
    buttocks to the feet, and sent them away.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when they were gone, they sent word to David, who
    sent to meet them (for they had suffered a great affront) and
    ordered them to stay at Jericho till their beards grew and then
    to return.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the children of Ammon saw that they had done
    an injury to David, Hanon and the rest of the people sent a
    thousand talents of silver, to hire them chariots and horsemen
    out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria Maacha, and out of
    Soba.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they hired two and thirty thousand chariots, and
    the king of Maacha, with his people. And they came and camped
    over against Medaba. And the children of Ammon gathered
    themselves together out of their cities, and came to
    battle.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the
    army of valiant men:</span></li>

    <li><span>And the children of Ammon came out and put their army
    in array before the gate of the city : and the kings, that were
    come to their aid, stood apart in the field.</span></li>

    <li><span>Wherefore Joab understanding that the battle was set
    against him before and behind, chose out the bravest men of all
    Israel, and marched against the Syrians,</span></li>

    <li><span>And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand
    of Abisai his brother, and they went against the children of
    Ammon.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said: If the Syrians be too strong for me,
    then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too
    strong for thee, I will help thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>Be of good courage and let us behave ourselves
    manfully for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the
    Lord will do that which is good in his sight.</span></li>

    <li><span>So Joab and the people that were with him, went
    against the Syrians to the battle : and he put them to
    flight.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the children of Ammon seeing that the Syrians
    were fled, they likewise fled from Abisai his brother, and went
    into the city: and Joab also returned to Jerusalem.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the Syrians seeing that they had fallen before
    Israel, sent messengers, and brought to them the Syrians that
    were beyond the river: and Sophach, general of the army of
    Adarezer, was their leader.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it was told David, and he gathered together all
    Israel, and passed the Jordan, and came upon them, and put his
    army in array against them, and they fought with
    him.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the Syrian fled before Israel: and David slew of
    the Syrians seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand
    footmen, and Sophach the general of the army.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when the servants of Adarezer saw themselves
    overcome by Israel, they went over to David, and served him:
    and Syria would not help the children of Ammon any
    more.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="20">1 Paralipomenon 20</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And it came to pass after the course of a year, at
    the time that kings go out to battle, Joab gathered together an
    army and the strength of the troops, and wasted the land of the
    children of Ammon: and went and besieged Rabba. But David
    stayed at Jerusalem, when Joab smote Rabba, and destroyed
    it.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David took the crown of Melchom from his head,
    and found in it a talent weight of gold, and most precious
    stones, and he made himself a diadem of it: he took also the
    spoils of the city which were very great.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the people that were therein he brought out: and
    made harrows, and sleds, and chariots of iron to go over them,
    so that they were cut and bruised to pieces: in this manner
    David dealt with all the cities of the children of Ammon : and
    he returned with alibis people to Jerusalem.</span></li>

    <li><span>After this there arose a war at Gazer against the
    Philistines: in which Sabachai the Husathite slew Saphai of the
    race of Raphaim, and humbled them.</span></li>

    <li><span>Another battle also was fought against the
    Philistines, in which Adeodatus the son of Saltus a
    Bethlehemite slew the brother of Goliath the Gethite, the staff
    of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.</span></li>

    <li><span>There was another battle also in Geth, in which there
    was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four
    and twenty, six on each hand and foot: who also was born of the
    stock of Rapha.</span></li>

    <li><span>He reviled Israel: but Jonathan the son of Samaa the
    brother of David slew him. These were the sons of Rapha in
    Geth, who fell by the hand of David and his
    servants.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="21">1 Paralipomenon 21</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And Satan rose up against Israel: and moved David to
    number Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David said to Joab, and to the rulers of the
    people: Go, and number Israel from Bersabee even to Dan, and
    bring me the number of them that I may know it.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Joab answered: The Lord make his people a hundred
    times more than they are : but, my lord the king, are they not
    all thy servants: why doth my lord seek this thing, which may
    be imputed as a sin to Israel?</span></li>

    <li><span>But the king's word rather prevailed: and Joab
    departed, and went through all Israel: and returned to
    Jerusalem.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he gave David the number of them, whom he had
    surveyed: and all the number of Israel was found to be eleven
    hundred thousand men that drew the sword: and of Juda four
    hundred and seventy thousand fighting men.</span></li>

    <li><span>But Levi and Benjamin he did not number: for Joab
    unwillingly executed the king's orders.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God was displeased with this thing that was
    commanded: and he struck Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David said to God: I have sinned exceedingly in
    doing this: I beseech thee take away the iniquity of thy
    servant, for I have done foolishly.</span></li>

    <li><span>8oor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord spoke to Gad the seer of David,
    saying:</span></li>

    <li><span>Go, and speak to David, and tell him: Thus saith the
    Lord: I give thee the choice of three things: choose one which
    thou wilt, and I will do it to thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>And when Gad was come to David, he said to him: Thus
    saith the Lord: choose which thou wilt:</span></li>

    <li><span>Either three years' famine: or three months to flee
    from thy enemies, and not to be able to escape their sword: or
    three days to have the sword of the Lord, and pestilence in the
    land, and the angel of the Lord destroying in all the coasts of
    Israel: now therefore see what I shall answer him who sent
    me.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David said to Gad: I am on every side in a great
    strait: but it is better for me to fall into the hands of the
    Lord, for his mercies are many, than into the hands of
    men.</span></li>

    <li><span>So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel. And there
    fell of Israel seventy thousand men.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he sent an angel to Jerusalem, to strike it: and
    as he was striking it, the Lord beheld, and took pity for the
    greatness of the evil: and said to the angel that destroyed: It
    is enough, now stop thy hand. And the angel of the Lord stood
    by the thrashing</span></li>

    <li><span>And David lifting up his eyes, saw the angel of the
    Lord standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in
    his hand, turned against Jerusalem: and both he and the
    ancients clothed in haircloth, fell down flat on the
    ground.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David said to God: Am not I he that commanded the
    people to be numbered? It is I that have sinned: it is I that
    have done the evil: but as for this flock, what hath it
    deserved? O Lord my God, let thy hand be turned, I beseech
    thee, upon me, and upon my father's house: and let not thy
    people be destroyed.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to tell
    David, to go up, and build an altar to the Lord God in the
    thrashingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span></li>

    <li><span>and David went up, according to the word of Gad,
    which he spoke to him in the name of the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now when Ornan looked up, and saw the angel, he and
    his four sons hid themselves: for at that time he was thrashing
    wheat in the floor.</span></li>

    <li><span>And as David was coming to Ornan, Ornan saw him, and
    went out of the thrashingfloor to meet him, and bowed down to
    him with his face to the ground.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David said to him: Give me this place of thy
    thrashingfloor, that I may build therein an altar to the Lord:
    but thou shalt take of me as much money as it is worth, that
    the plague may cease from the people.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Ornan said to David: Take it, and let my lord the
    king do all that pleaseth him: and moreover the oxen also I
    give for a holocaust, and the drays for wood, and the wheat for
    the sacrifice: I will give it all willingly.</span></li>

    <li><span>And king David said to him: It shall not be so, but I
    will give thee money as much se it is worth: for I must not
    take it from thee, and so offer to the Lord holocausts free
    cost.</span></li>

    <li><span>So David gave to Ornan for the place, six hundred
    sides of gold of just weight.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he built there an altar to the Lord: and he
    offered holocausts, and peace offerings, and he called upon the
    Lord, and he heard him by sending Are from heaven upon the
    altar of the holocaust.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord commanded the angel: and he put up his
    sword again into the sheath.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David seeing that the Lord had heard him in the
    thrashingfloor of Oman the Jebusite, forthwith offered victims
    there.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses made in
    the desert, and the altar of holocausts, was at that time in
    the high place of Gabaon.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David could not go to the altar there to pray to
    God: for he was seized with an exceeding great fear, seeing the
    sword of the angel of the Lord.</span></li>
  </ol>

  <h2><a name="22">1 Paralipomenon 22</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>Then David said: This is the house of God, and this
    is the altar for the holocaust of Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he commanded to gather together all the
    proselytes of the land of Israel, and out of them he appointed
    stonecutters to hew stones and polish them, to build the house
    of God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David prepared in abundance iron for the nails of
    the gates, and for the closures and joinings: and of brass an
    immense weight.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the cedar trees were without number, which the
    Sidonians, and Tyrians brought to David.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David said: Solomon my son is very young and
    tender, and the house which I would have to be built to the
    Lord, must be such as to be renowned in all countries:
    therefore I will prepare him necessaries. And therefore before
    his death he prepared all the charges.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he called for Solomon his son: and commanded him
    to build a house to the Lord the God of Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David said to Solomon: My son, it was my desire
    to have built a house to the name of the Lord my
    God.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Thou
    hast shed much blood, and fought many battles, so thou canst
    not build a house to my name, after shedding so much blood
    before me:</span></li>

    <li><span>The son, that shall be born to thee, shall be a most
    quiet man: for I will make him rest from all his enemies round
    about: and therefore he shall be called Peaceable: and I will
    give peace and quietness to Israel all his days.</span></li>

    <li><span>He shall build a house to my name, and he shall be a
    son to me, and I will be a father to him: and I will establish
    the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now then, my son, the Lord be with thee, and do thou
    prosper, and build the house to the Lord thy God, as he hath
    spoken of thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>The Lord also give thee wisdom and understanding,
    that thou mayest be able to rule Israel, and to keep the law of
    the Lord thy God.</span></li>

    <li><span>For then thou shalt be able to prosper, if thou keep
    the commandments, and judgments, which the Lord commanded Moses
    to teach Israel: take courage and act manfully, fear not, nor
    be dismayed.</span></li>

    <li><span>Behold I in my poverty have prepared the charges of
    the house of the Lord, of gold a hundred thousand talents, and
    of silver a million of talents: but of brass, and of iron there
    is no weight, for the abundance surpasseth all account: timber
    also and stones I have prepared for all the
    charges.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thou hast also workmen in abundance, hewers of
    stones, and masons, and carpenters, and of all trades the most
    skilful in their work,</span></li>

    <li><span>In gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron,
    whereof there is no number. Arise then, and be doing, and the
    Lord will be with thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>David also charged all the princes of Israel, to help
    Solomon his son,</span></li>

    <li><span>Saying: You see, that the Lord your God is with you,
    and hath given you rest round about, and hath delivered all
    your enemies into your hands, and the land is subdued before
    the Lord, and be- fore his people.</span></li>

    <li><span>Give therefore your hearts and your souls, to seek
    the Lord your God: and arise, and build a sanctuary to the Lord
    God, that the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the vessels
    consecrated to the Lord, may be brought into the house, which
    is built to the name of the Lord.</span></li>

  <h2><a name="23">1 Paralipomenon 23</a></h2>

  <ol>
    <li><span>And David being old and full of days, made Solomon
    his son king over Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he gathered together all the princes of Israel,
    and the priests and Levites.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty
    years, and upwards: and there were found of them thirty-eight
    thousand men.</span></li>

    <li><span>Of these twenty-four thousand were chosen, and
    distributed unto the ministry of the house of the Lord: and six
    thousand were the overseers and judges.</span></li>

    <li><span>Moreover four thousand were porters: and as many
    singers singing to the Lord with the instruments, which he had
    made to sing with.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David distributed them into courses by the
    families of the sons of Levi, to wit, of Gerson, and of Caath,
    and of Merari.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Gerson were Leedan and Semei.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Leedan: the chief Jahiel, and Zethan, and
    Joel, three.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Semei: Salomith, and Hosiel, and Aran,
    three: these were the heads of the families of
    Leedan.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the sons of Semei were Leheth, and Ziza, and
    Jaus, and Baria: these were the sons of Semei,
    four.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Leheth was the first, Ziza the second: but Jaus
    and Baria had not many children, and therefore they were
    counted in one family, and in one house.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Caath were Amram, and Isaar, Hebron, and
    Oziel, four.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Amram, Aaron, and Moses. And Aaron was
    separated to minister in the holy of holies, he and his sons
    for ever, and to burn incense before the Lord, according to his
    ceremonies, and to bless his name for ever.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons also of Moses, the man of God, were numbered
    in the tribe of Levi.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Moses were Gersom and
    Eliezer:</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Gersom: Subuel the first.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the sons of Eliezer were: Rohobia the first: and
    Eliezer had no more sons. But the sons of Rohobia were
    multiplied exceedingly.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Isaar: Salomith the first.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Hebron: Jeriau the first, Amarias the
    second, Jahaziel the third, Jecmaam the fourth.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Oziel: Micha the first, Jesia the
    second.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Merari: Moholi, and Musi. The sons of
    Moholi: Eleazar and Cia.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Eleazar died, and had no sons but daughters: and
    the sons of Cis their brethren took them.</span></li>

    <li><span>The sons of Musi: Moholi, and Eder, and Jerimoth,
    three.</span></li>

    <li><span>These are the sons of Levi in their kindreds and
    families, princes by their courses, and the number of every
    head that did the works of the ministry of the house of the
    Lord from twenty years old and upward.</span></li>

    <li><span>For David said: The Lord the God of Israel hath given
    rest to his people, and a habitation in Jerusalem for
    ever.</span></li>

    <li><span>And it shall not be the office of the Levites to
    carry any more the tabernacle, and all the vessels for the
    service thereof.</span></li>

    <li><span>So according to the last precepts of David, the sons
    of Levi are to be numbered from twenty years old and
    upward.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they are to be under the hand of the sons of
    Aaron for the service of the house of the Lord, in the porches,
    and in the chambers, and in the place of purification, and in
    the sanctuary, and in all the works of the ministry of the
    temple of the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the priests have the charge of the leaves of
    proposition, and of the sacrifice of fine flour, and of the
    unleavened cakes, and of the fryingpan, and of the roasting,
    and of every weight and measure.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Levites are to stand in the morning to give
    thanks, and to sing praises to the Lord: and in like manner in
    the evening,</span></li>

    <li><span>As well in the oblation of the holocausts of the
    Lord, as in the sabbaths and in the new moons, and the rest of
    the solemnities, according to the number and ceremonies
    prescribed for every thing, continually before the
    Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>And let them keep the observances of the tabernacle
    of the covenant, and the ceremonies of the sanctuary, and the
    charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, that they may

    <li><span>But Nadab and Abiu died before their father, and had
    no children: so Eleazar, and Ithamar did the office of the
    priesthood.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David distributed them, that is, Sadoc of the
    sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar,
    according to their courses and ministry.</span></li>

    <li><span>And there were found many more of the sons of Eleazar

    divided them so, that there were of the sons of Eleazar,
    sixteen chief men by their families: and of the sons of Ithamar
    eight by their families and houses.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he divided both the families one with the other
    by lot: for there were princes of the sanctuary, and princes of
    God, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of
    Ithamar.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Semeias the son of Nathanael the scribe a Levite,

    over the rest, of Eleazar: and another house, which had the
    rest under it, of Ithamar.</span></li>

    my brethren and my people: I had a thought to have built a
    house, in which the ark of the Lord, and the footstool of our
    God might rest: and I prepared all things for the
    building.</span></li>

    <li><span>And God said to me: Thou shalt not build a house to
    my name: because thou art a man of war, and hast shed
    blood.</span></li>

    <li><span>But the Lord God of Israel chose me of all the house
    of my father, to be king over Israel for ever: for of Juda he
    chose the princes: and of the house of Juda, my father's house:
    and among the sons of my father, it pleased him to choose me
    king over all Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And among my sons (for the Lord hath given me many
    sons) he hath chosen Solomon my son, to sit upon the throne of
    the kingdom of the Lord over Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he said to me: Solomon thy son shall build my
    house, and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I
    will be a father to him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he
    continue to keep my commandments, and my judgments, as at this
    day.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now then before all the assembly of Israel, in the
    hearing of our God, keep ye, and seek all the commandments of
    the Lord our God: that you may possess the good land, and may
    leave it to your children after you for ever.</span></li>

    <li><span>And thou my son Solomon, know the God of thy father,
    and serve him with a perfect heart, and a willing mind: "for
    the Lord searcheth all hearts, and under- standeth all the
    thoughts of minds. If thou seek him, thou shalt find him: but
    if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for
    ever.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now therefore seeing the Lord hath chosen thee to
    build the house of the sanctuary, take courage, and do
    it.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David gave to Solomon his son a description of
    the porch, and of the temple, and of the treasures, and of the
    upper floor, and of the inner chambers, and of the house for
    the mercy seat,</span></li>

    <li><span>As also of all the courts, which he had in his

    things,</span></li>

    <li><span>And of the divisions of the priests and of the

    <li><span>Gold by weight for every vessel for the ministry. And
    silver by weight ac- cording to the diversity of the vessels
    and uses.</span></li>

    <li><span>He gave also gold for the golden candlesticks, and
    their lamps, according to the dimensions of every candlestick,
    and the lamps thereof. In like manner also he gave silver by
    weight for the silver candlesticks, and for their lamps
    according to the diversity of the dimensions of
    them.</span></li>

    <li><span>He gave also gold for the tables of proposition,
    according to the diversity of the tables: in like manner also
    silver for other tables of silver.</span></li>

    <li><span>For fleshhooks also, and bowls, and censers of fine
    gold, and for little lions of gold, according to the measure he
    gave by weight, for every lion. In like manner also for lions
    of silver he set aside a different weight of
    silver.</span></li>

    <li><span>And for the altar of incense, he gave the purest
    gold: and to make the likeness of the chariot of the cherubims
    spreading their wings, and covering the ark of the covenant of
    the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>All these things, said he, came to me written by the
    hand of the Lord that I might understand all the works of the
    pattern.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David said to Solomon his son: Act like a man,
    and take courage, and do: fear not, and be not dismayed: for
    the Lord my God will be with thee, and will not leave thee, nor
    forsake thee, till thou hast finished all the work for the
    service of the house of the Lord.</span></li>

    <li><span>Behold the courses of the priests and the Levites,

    and the work is great, for a house is prepared not for man, but
    for God.</span></li>

    <li><span>And I with all my ability have prepared the expenses
    for the house of my God. Gold for vessels of gold, and silver
    for vessels of silver, brass for things of brass, iron for
    things of iron, wood for things of wood: and onyx stones, and
    stones like alabaster, and of divers colours, and all manner of
    precious stones, and marble of Paros in great
    abundance.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now over and above the things which I have offered
    into the house of my God I give of my own proper goods, gold

    prepared for the holy house.</span></li>

    <li><span>Three thousand talents of gold of the gold of Ophir:

    <li><span>Thine, O Lord, is magnificence, and power, and glory,
    and victory: and to thee is praise: for all that is in heaven,
    and in earth, is thine: thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou
    art above all princes.</span></li>

    <li><span>Thine are riches, and thine is glory, thou hast
    dominion over all, in thy hand is power and might: in thy hand
    greatness, and the empire of all things.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now therefore our God we give thanks to thee, and we
    praise thy glorious name.</span></li>

    <li><span>Who am I, and what is my people, that we should be
    able to promise thee all these things? all things are thine:
    and we have given thee what we received of thy
    hand.</span></li>

    <li><span>For we are sojourners before thee, and strangers, as
    were all our fathers. Our days upon earth are as a shadow, and
    there is no stay.</span></li>

    <li><span>O Lord our God, all this store that we have prepared
    to build thee a house for thy holy name, is from thy hand, and
    all things are thine.</span></li>

    <li><span>I know my God that thou provest hearts, and lovest
    simplicity, wherefore I also in the simplicity of my heart,
    have joyfully offered all these things: and I have seen with
    great joy thy people, which are here present, offer thee their
    offerings.</span></li>

    <li><span>O Lord God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Israel
    our fathers, keep for ever this will of their heart, and let
    this mind remain always for the worship of thee.</span></li>

    <li><span>And give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, that he
    may keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy ceremonies,
    and do all things: and build the house, for which I have
    provided the charges.</span></li>

    <li><span>And David commanded all the assembly: Bless ye the
    Lord our God. And all the assembly blessed the Lord the God of
    their fathers: and they bowed themselves and worshipped God,
    and then the king.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they sacrificed victims to the Lord: and they
    offered holocausts the next day, a thousand bullocks, a
    thousand rams, a thousand lambs, with their libations, and with
    every thing prescribed most abundantly for all
    Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And they ate, and drank before the Lord that day with
    great joy. And they anointed the second time Solomon the son of
    David. And they anointed him to the Lord to be prince, end
    Sadoc to be high priest.</span></li>

    <li><span>And Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king
    instead of David his father, and he pleased all: and all Israel
    obeyed him.</span></li>

    <li><span>And all the princes, and men of power, and all the
    sons of king David gave their hand, and were subject to Solomon
    the king.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the Lord magnified Solomon over all Israel: and
    gave him the glory of a reign, such as no king of Israel had
    before him.</span></li>

    <li><span>So David the son of Isai reigned over all
    Israel.</span></li>

    <li><span>And the days that he reigned over Israel, were forty
    years: in Hebron he reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem three
    and thirty years.</span></li>

    <li><span>And he died in a good age, full of days, and riches,
    and glory. And Solomon his son reigned in his
    stead.</span></li>

    <li><span>Now the acts of king David first and last are written
    in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the
    prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer:</span></li>

    <li><span>And of all his reign, and his valour, and of the
    times that passed under him, either in Israel, or in all the
    kingdoms of the countries.</span></li>
