<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="1">Job 1</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>There was a man in the land of Hus, whose name was Job,
and that man was simple and upright, and fearing God, and avoiding
evil.</span></li>
<li><span>And there were born to him seven sons and three
daughters.</span></li>
<li><span>And his possession was seven thousand sheep, and three
thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred
she asses, and a family exceeding great: and this man was great
among all the people of the east.</span></li>
<li><span>And his sons went, and made a feast by houses every one
in his day. And sending they called their three sisters to eat and
drink with them.</span></li>
<li><span>And when the days of their feasting were gone about, Job
sent to them, and sanctified them: and rising up early offered
holocausts for every one of them. For he said: Lest perhaps my sons
have sinned, and have blessed God in their hearts. So did Job all
days.</span></li>
<li><span>Now on a certain day when the sons of God came to stand
before the Lord, Satan also was present among them.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to him: Whence comest thou ? And he
answered and said: I have gone round about the earth, and walked
through it.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to him: Hast thou considered my servant
Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a simple and upright
man, and fearing God, and avoiding evil?</span></li>
<li><span>And Satan answering, said: Doth Job fear God in vain
?</span></li>
<li><span>Hast not thou made a fence for him, and his house, and
all his substance round about, blessed the works of his hands, and
his possession hath increased on the earth ?</span></li>
<li><span>But stretch forth thy hand a little, and touch all that
he hath, and see if he blesseth thee not to thy face.</span></li>
<li><span>Then the Lord said to Satan: Behold, all that he hath is
in thy hand: only put not forth thy hand upon his person. And Satan
went forth from the presence of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Now upon a certain day when his sons and daughters were
eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest
brother,</span></li>
<li><span>There came a messenger to Job, and said: The oxen were
ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them,</span></li>
<li><span>And the Sabeans rushed in, and took all away, and slew
the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And while he was yet speaking, another came, and said:
The fire of God fell from heaven, and striking the sheep and the
servants, hath consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And while he also was yet speaking, there came another,
and said: The Chaldeans made three troops, and have fallen upon the
camels, and taken them, moreover they have slain the servants with
the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell thee.</span></li>
<li><span>He was yet speaking, and behold another came in, and
said: Thy sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the
house of their elder brother:</span></li>
<li><span>A violent wind came on a sudden from the side of the
desert, and shook the four corners of the house, and it fell upon
thy children and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to fell
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Job rose up, and rent his garments, and having
shaven his head fell down upon the ground and
worshipped,</span></li>
<li><span>And said: Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked
shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken
away: as it hath pleased the Lord so is it done: blessed be the
name of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>In all these things Job sinned not by his lips, nor spoke
he any foolish thing against God.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="2">Job 2</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And it came to pass, when on a certain day the sons of
God came, and stood before the Lord, and Satan came among them, and
stood in his sight,</span></li>
<li><span>That the Lord said to Satan: Whence comest thou ? And he
answered and said: I have gone round about the earth, and walked
through it.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Satan: Hast thou considered my
servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a man
simple, and upright, and fearing Cod, and avoiding evil, and still
keeping his innocence ? But thou hast moved me against him, that I
sho uld afflict him without cause.</span></li>
<li><span>And Satan answered, and said: Skin for skin, and all that
a man hath he will give for his life:</span></li>
<li><span>gut put forth thy hand, and touch his bone and his flesh,
and then thou shalt gee that he will bless thee to thy
face.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Satan: Behold be is in thy hand, but
yet save his life.</span></li>
<li><span>So Satan went forth from the presence Of the Lord, and
struck Job with a very grievous ulcer, from the sole of the foot
even to the top of his head:</span></li>
<li><span>And he took a potsherd and scraped the corrupt matter,
sitting on a dunghill.</span></li>
<li><span>And his wife said to him: Dost thou still continue in thy
simplicity? bless God and die.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to her: Thou hast; spoken like one of the
foolish women: if we have received good things at the hand of God,
why should we not receive evil? In all these things Job did not sin
with his lips.</span></li>
<li><span>Now when Job's three friends heard all the evil that had
befallen him, they came every one from his own place, Alphas the
Themanite, and Baldad the Suhite, and Sophar the Naamathite. For
they had made an appointment to come together and visit him, a nd
comfort him.</span></li>
<li><span>And when they had lifted up their eyes afar off, they
knew him not, and crying out they wept, and rending their garments
they sprinkled dust upon their heads towards heaven.</span></li>
<li><span>And they sat with him on the ground seven days and seven
nights, and no man spoke to him a word: for they saw that his grief
was very great.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="3">Job 3</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed his
day,</span></li>
<li><span>and he said:</span></li>
<li><span>Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in
which it was said: A man child is conceived.</span></li>
<li><span>Let that day be turned into darkness, let not God regard
it from above, and let not the light shine upon it.</span></li>
<li><span>Let darkness, and the shadow of death cover it, let a
mist overspread it, and let it be wrapped up in
bitterness.</span></li>
<li><span>Let a darksome whirlwind seize upon that night, let it
not be counted in the days of the year, nor numbered in the
months.</span></li>
<li><span>Let that night be solitary, and not worthy of
praise.</span></li>
<li><span>Let them curse it who curse the day. who are ready to
raise up a leviathan:</span></li>
<li><span>Let the stars be darkened with the mist thereof: let it
expect light and not see it, nor the rising of the dawning of the
day:</span></li>
<li><span>Because it shut not up the doors of the womb that bore
me, nor took away evils from my eyes.</span></li>
<li><span>Why did I not die in the womb, why did I not perish when
I came out of the belly?</span></li>
<li><span>Why received upon the knees? why suckled at the breasts
?</span></li>
<li><span>For now I should have been asleep and still, and should
have rest in my sleep.</span></li>
<li><span>With kings and consuls of the earth, who build themselves
solitudes:</span></li>
<li><span>Or with princes, that possess gold, and All their houses
with silver:</span></li>
<li><span>Or as a hidden untimely birth I should not be, or as they
that being conceived have not seen the light.</span></li>
<li><span>There the wicked cease from tumult, and there the wearied
in strength are at rest.</span></li>
<li><span>And they sometime bound together without disquiet, have
not heard the voice of the oppressor.</span></li>
<li><span>The small and great are there, and the servant is free
from his master.</span></li>
<li><span>Why is light given to him that is in misery, and life to
them that are in bitterness of soul?</span></li>
<li><span>That look for death, and it cometh not, as they that dig
for a treasure:</span></li>
<li><span>And they rejoice exceedingly when they have found the
grave.</span></li>
<li><span>To a man whose way is hidden, and God hath surrounded him
with darkness?</span></li>
<li><span>Before I eat I sigh: and as overflowing waters, so is my
roaring:</span></li>
<li><span>For the fear which I feared hath come upon me: and that
which I was afraid of, hath befallen me.</span></li>
<li><span>Have I not dissembled ? have I not kept silence ? have I
not been quiet? and indignation is come upon me.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="4">Job 4</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Then Eliphaz the Themanite answered, and
said:</span></li>
<li><span>If we begin to speak to thee, perhaps thou wilt take it
ill, but who can withhold the words he hath conceived?</span></li>
<li><span>Behold thou hast taught many, and thou hast strengthened
the weary hands:</span></li>
<li><span>Thy words have confirmed them that were staggering, and
thou hast strengthened the trembling knees:</span></li>
<li><span>But now the scourge is come upon thee, and thou faintest:
it hath touched thee, and thou art troubled.</span></li>
<li><span>Where is thy fear, thy fortitude, thy patience, and the
perfection of thy ways?</span></li>
<li><span>Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished being innocent?
or when were the just destroyed?</span></li>
<li><span>On the contrary I have seen those who work iniquity, and
sow sorrows, and reap them,</span></li>
<li><span>Perishing by the blast of God, and consumed by the spirit
of his wrath.</span></li>
<li><span>The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the lioness,
and the teeth of the whelps of lions are broken:</span></li>
<li><span>The tiger hath perished for want of prey, and the young
lions are scattered abroad.</span></li>
<li><span>Now there was a word spoken to me in private, and my ears
by stealth as it were received the veins of its
whisper.</span></li>
<li><span>In the horror of a vision by night, when deep sleep is
wont to hold men,</span></li>
<li><span>Fear seized upon me, and trembling, and all my bones were
affrighted:</span></li>
<li><span>And when a spirit passed before me, the hair of my flesh
stood up.</span></li>
<li><span>There stood one whose countenance I knew not, an image
before my eyes, and I heard the voice as it were of a gentle
wind:</span></li>
<li><span>Shall man be justified in comparison of God, or shall a
man be more pure than his maker?</span></li>
<li><span>Behold they that serve him are not steadfast, and in his
angels he found wickedness:</span></li>
<li><span>How much more shall they that dwell in houses of clay,
who have an earthly foundation, be consumed as with the
moth?</span></li>
<li><span>From morning till evening they shall be cut down: and
because no one understandeth, they shall perish for
ever.</span></li>
<li><span>And they that shall be left, shall be taken away from
them: they shall die, and not in wisdom.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="5">Job 5</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Call now if there be any that will answer thee, and turn
to some of the saints.</span></li>
<li><span>Anger indeed killeth the foolish, and envy slayeth the
little one.</span></li>
<li><span>I have seen a fool with a strong root, and I cursed his
beauty immediately.</span></li>
<li><span>His children shall be far from safety, and shall be
destroyed in the gate, and there shall be none to deliver
them.</span></li>
<li><span>Whose harvest the hungry shall eat, and the armed man
shall take him by violence, and the thirsty shall drink up his
riches.</span></li>
<li><span>Nothing upon earth is done without a voice cause, and
sorrow doth not spring out of the ground.</span></li>
<li><span>Man is born to labour and the bird to fly.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore I will pray to the Lord, and address my speech
to God:</span></li>
<li><span>Who doth great things and unsearchable and wonderful
things without number:</span></li>
<li><span>Who giveth rain upon the face of the earth, and watereth
all things with waters:</span></li>
<li><span>Who setteth up the humble on high, and comforteth with
health those that mourn.</span></li>
<li><span>Who bringeth to nought the designs of the malignant, so
that their hands cannot accomplish what they had begun:</span></li>
<li><span>Who catcheth the wise in their craftiness, and
disappointeth the counsel of the wicked:</span></li>
<li><span>They shall meet with darkness in the day, and grope at
noonday as in the night.</span></li>
<li><span>But he shall save the needy from the sword of their
mouth, and the poor from the hand of the violent.</span></li>
<li><span>And to the needy there shall he hope, but iniquity shall
draw in her mouth.</span></li>
<li><span>Blessed is the mall whom God correcteth: refuse not
therefore the chastising of the lord:</span></li>
<li><span>For he woundeth, and cureth: he striketh, and his hands
shall heal.</span></li>
<li><span>In six troubles he shall deliver thee, and in the
seventh, evil shall not touch thee.</span></li>
<li><span>In famine he shall deliver thee from death: and in
battle, from the hand of the sword.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt he hidden from the scourge of the tongue: and
thou shalt not fear calamity when it cometh.</span></li>
<li><span>In destruction and famine then shalt laugh: and thou
shalt not be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>But thou shalt have a covenant with the stones of the
lands, and the beasts of the earth shall be at pence with
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle is in peace, and
visiting thy beauty thou shalt not sin.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be multiplied,
and thy offspring like the grass of the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou shalt enter into the grave in abundance, as a heap
of wheat is brought in its season.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold, this is even so, as we have searched oat: which
thou having heard, consider it thoroughly in thy mind.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="6">Job 6</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>But Job answered, and said:</span></li>
<li><span>O that my sins, whereby I have deserved wrath, and the
calamity that I suffer, were weighed in a balance.</span></li>
<li><span>As the sand of the sea this would appear heavier:
therefore my words are full of sorrow :</span></li>
<li><span>For the arrows of the Lord are in me, the rage whereof
drinketh up my spirit, and the terrors of the Lord war against
me.</span></li>
<li><span>Will the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or will the ox
low when he standeth before a full manger?</span></li>
<li><span>Or can an unsavoury thing be eaten, that is not seasoned
with salt? or can a man taste that which when tasted bringeth
death?</span></li>
<li><span>The things which before my soul would not touch, now,
through anguish are my meats.</span></li>
<li><span>Who will grant that my request may come: and that God may
give me what I look for?</span></li>
<li><span>And that he that hath begun may destroy me, that he may
let loose his hand, and cut me off?</span></li>
<li><span>And that this may be my comfort, that afflicting me with
sorrow, he spare not, nor I contradict the words of the Holy
One.</span></li>
<li><span>For what is my strength, that I can hold out? or what is
my end that I should keep patience?</span></li>
<li><span>My strength is not the strength of stones, nor is my
flesh of brass.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold there is no help for me in myself, and my familiar
friends also are departed from me.</span></li>
<li><span>He that taketh away mercy from his friend, forsaketh the
fear of the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>My brethren have passed by me, as the torrent that
passeth swiftly in the valleys.</span></li>
<li><span>They that fear the hoary frost, the snow shall fall upon
them.</span></li>
<li><span>At the time when they shall be scattered they shall
perish: and after it groweth hot they shall be melted out of their
place.</span></li>
<li><span>The paths of their steps are entangled: they shall walk
in vain, and shall perish.</span></li>
<li><span>Consider the paths of Thema, the ways of Saba, and wait a
little while.</span></li>
<li><span>They are confounded, because I have hoped: they are come
also even unto me, and are covered with shame.</span></li>
<li><span>Now you are come: and now seeing my affliction you are
afraid.</span></li>
<li><span>Did I say: Bring to me, and give me of your
substance?</span></li>
<li><span>Or deliver me from the hand of the enemy, and rescue me
out of the hand of the mighty?</span></li>
<li><span>Teach me, and I will hold my peace: and if I have been
ignorant in any thing, instruct me.</span></li>
<li><span>Why have you detracted the words of truth, whereas there
is none of you that can reprove me?</span></li>
<li><span>You dress up speeches only to rebuke, and you utter words
to the wind.</span></li>
<li><span>You rush in upon the fatherless, and you endeavour to
overthrow your friend.</span></li>
<li><span>However finish what you have begun, give ear, and see
whether I lie.</span></li>
<li><span>Answer, I beseech you, without contention: and speaking
that which is just, judge ye.</span></li>
<li><span>And you shall not And iniquity in my tongue, neither
shall folly sound in my mouth.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="7">Job 7</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>The life of man upon earth is a warfare, and his days are
like the days of a hireling.</span></li>
<li><span>As a servant longeth for the shade, as the hireling
looketh for the end of his work;</span></li>
<li><span>So I also have had empty months, and have numbered to
myself wearisome nights.</span></li>
<li><span>If I lie down to sleep, I shall say: When shall arise?
and again I shall look for the evening, and shall be filled with
sorrows even till darkness.</span></li>
<li><span>My flesh is clothed with rottenness and the filth of
dust, my skin is withered and drawn together.</span></li>
<li><span>My days have passed more swiftly than the web is cut by
the weaver, and are consumed without any hope.</span></li>
<li><span>Remember that my life is but wind, and my eyes shall not
return to see good things.</span></li>
<li><span>Nor shall the sight of man behold me: thy eyes are upon
me, and I shall be no more.</span></li>
<li><span>As a cloud is consumed, and passeth away: so he that
shall go down to hell shall not come up.</span></li>
<li><span>Nor shall he return my more into his house, neither shall
his place know him any more.</span></li>
<li><span>Wherefore I will not spare my month, I will speak in the
affliction of my spirit: I will talk with the bitterness of my
soul.</span></li>
<li><span>Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou hast enclosed me in a
prison?</span></li>
<li><span>If I say: My bed shall comfort me, and I shall be
relieved speaking with myself on my couch:</span></li>
<li><span>Thou wilt frighten me with dreams and terrify me with
visions.</span></li>
<li><span>So that my soul rather chooseth hanging, and my bones
death.</span></li>
<li><span>I have done with hope, I shall now live no longer: spare
me, for my days are nothing.</span></li>
<li><span>What is a man that thou shouldst magnify him? or why dost
thou set thy heart upon him?</span></li>
<li><span>Thou visitest him early in the morning, and thou provest
him suddenly.</span></li>
<li><span>How long wilt thou not spare me, nor suffer me to swallow
down my spittle?</span></li>
<li><span>I have sinned: what shall I do to thee, O keeper of men?
why hast thou set me opposite to thee, and I am become burdensome
to myself?</span></li>
<li><span>Why dost thou not remove my sin, and why dost thou not
take away my iniquity? Behold now I shall sleep in the dust: and if
thou seek me in the morning, I shall not be.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="8">Job 8</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>The Baldad the Suhite answered, and said:</span></li>
<li><span>How long wilt thou speak these things, and how long shall
the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?</span></li>
<li><span>Doth God pervert judgment, or doth the Almighty overthrow
that which is just?</span></li>
<li><span>Although thy children have sinned against him, and he
hath left them in the hand of their iniquity:</span></li>
<li><span>Yet if thou wilt arise early to God, and wilt beseech the
Almighty:</span></li>
<li><span>If thou wilt walk clean and upright, he will presently
awake onto thee, and will make the dwelling of thy justice
peaceable:</span></li>
<li><span>Insomuch, that if thy former things were small, thy
latter things would be multiplied exceedingly.</span></li>
<li><span>For inquire of the former generation, and search
diligently into the memory of the fathers:</span></li>
<li><span>(For we are but of yesterday, and are ignorant that our
days upon earth are but a shadow:)</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall teach thee: they shall speak to thee, and
utter words out of their hearts.</span></li>
<li><span>Can the rush be green without moisture? or a sedge-bush
grow without water?</span></li>
<li><span>When it is yet in flower, and is not plucked up with the
hand, it withereth before all herbs.</span></li>
<li><span>Even so are the ways of all that forget God, and the hope
of the hypocrite shall perish:</span></li>
<li><span>His folly shall not please him, and his trust shall be
like the spider's web.</span></li>
<li><span>He shall lean upon his house, and it shall not stand: he
shall prop it up, and it shall not rise:</span></li>
<li><span>He seemeth to have moisture before the sun cometh, and at
his rising his blossom shall shoot forth.</span></li>
<li><span>His roots shall be thick upon a heap of stones, and among
the stones he shall abide.</span></li>
<li><span>If one swallow him up out of his place, he shall deny
him, and shall say: I know thee not.</span></li>
<li><span>For this is the joy of his way, that others may spring
again out of the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>God will not cast away the simple, nor reach out his hand
to the evildoer:</span></li>
<li><span>Until thy mouth be filled with laughter, and thy lips
with rejoicing.</span></li>
<li><span>They that hate thee, shall be clothed with confusion: and
the dwelling of the wicked shall not stand.</span></li>

<li><span>Who commandeth tile sun and it riseth not: and shutteth
up the stars as it were under a seal:</span></li>
<li><span>Who alone spreadeth out the heavens, and walketh upon the
waves of the sea.</span></li>
<li><span>Who maketh Arcturus, and Orion, and Hyades, and the inner
parts of the south.</span></li>
<li><span>Who doth things great and incomprehensible, and
wonderful, of which there is no number.</span></li>
<li><span>If he come to me, I shall not see him: if he depart I
shall not understand.</span></li>
<li><span>If he examine on a sudden, who shall answer him? or who
can say: Why dost thou so?</span></li>
<li><span>God, whose wrath no mall can resist, and under whom they
stoop that bear up the world.</span></li>
<li><span>What am I then, that I should answer him, and have words
with him?</span></li>
<li><span>I, who although I should have any just thing, would not
answer, but would make supplication to my judge.</span></li>
<li><span>And if he should hear me when I call, I should not
believe that he had heard my voice.</span></li>
<li><span>For he shall crush me in a whirlwind, and multiply my
wounds even without cause.</span></li>
<li><span>He alloweth not my spirit to rest, and he filleth me with
bitterness.</span></li>
<li><span>If strength be demanded, he is most strong: if equity of
judgment, no man dare bear witness for me.</span></li>
<li><span>If I would justify myself, my own mouth shall condemn me:
if I would shew myself innocent, he shall prove me
wicked.</span></li>
<li><span>Although I should be simple, even this my soul shall be
ignorant of, and I shall be weary of my life.</span></li>
<li><span>One thing there is that I have spoken, both the innocent
and the wicked he consumeth.</span></li>
<li><span>If he scourge, let him kill at once, and not laugh at the
pains of the innocent.</span></li>
<li><span>The earth is given into the hand of the wicked, he
covereth the face of the judges thereof: and if it be not he, who
is it then?</span></li>
<li><span>My days have been swifter than a post: they have fled
away and have not seen good.</span></li>
<li><span>They have passed by as ships carrying fruits, as an eagle
flying to the prey.</span></li>
<li><span>If I say: I will not speak so: I change my face, and am
tormented with sorrow.</span></li>
<li><span>I feared all my works, knowing that thou didst not spare
the offender.</span></li>
<li><span>But if so also I am wicked, why have I laboured in
vain?</span></li>
<li><span>If I be washed as it were with snow waters, and my hands
shall shine ever so clean :</span></li>
<li><span>Yet thou shalt plunge me in filth, and my garments shall
abhor me,</span></li>
<li><span>For I shall not answer a man that is like myself: nor one
that may be heard with me equally in judgment.</span></li>
<li><span>There is none that may be able to reprove both, and to
put his hand between both.</span></li>
<li><span>Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear
terrify me.</span></li>
<li><span>I will speak, and will not fear him: for I cannot answer
while I am in fear.</span></li>

against myself, I will speak in the bitterness of my

<li><span>I will say to God: Do not condemn me: tell me why thou
judgest me so.</span></li>
<li><span>Doth it seem good to thee that thou shouldst calumniate
me, and oppress me, the work of thy own hands, and help the counsel
of the wicked?</span></li>
<li><span>Hast thou eyes of flesh: or, shalt thou see as man
seeth?</span></li>
<li><span>Are thy days as the days of man, and are thy years as the
times of men:</span></li>
<li><span>That thou shouldst inquire after my iniquity, and search
after my sin?</span></li>
<li><span>And shouldst know that I have done no wicked thing,
whereas there is no man that can deliver out of thy
hand.</span></li>
<li><span>Thy hands have made me, and fashioned me wholly round
about, and dost thou thus cast me down headlong on a
sudden?</span></li>
<li><span>Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the
clay, and thou wilt bring me into dust again.</span></li>
<li><span>Hast thou not milked me as milk, and curdled me like
cheese?</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh: thou hast put
me together with bones and sinews:</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast granted me life and mercy, and thy visitation
hath preserved my spirit.</span></li>
<li><span>Although thou conceal these things in thy heart, yet I
know that thou rememberest all things.</span></li>
<li><span>If I have sinned and thou hast spared me for an hour: why
dost thou not suffer me to be clean from my iniquity?</span></li>
<li><span>And if I be wicked, woe unto me: and if just, I shall not
lift up my head, being filled with affliction and
misery.</span></li>
<li><span>And for pride thou wilt take me as a lioness, and
returning thou tormentest me wonderfully.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and multipliest
thy wrath upon me, and pains war against me.</span></li>
<li><span>Why didst thou bring me forth out of the womb: O that I
had been consumed that eye might not see me!</span></li>
<li><span>I should have been as if I had not been, carried from the
womb to the grave.</span></li>
<li><span>Shall not the fewness of my days be ended shortly? suffer
me, therefore, that I may lament my sorrow a little:</span></li>
<li><span>Before I go, and return no more, to a land that is dark
and covered with the mist of death:</span></li>

ashamed to oppress me.</span></li>
<li><span>For if I have been ignorant, my ignorance shall be with
me.</span></li>
<li><span>But you have set yourselves up against me, and reprove me
with my reproaches.</span></li>
<li><span>At least now understand, that God hath not afflicted me
with an equal judgment, and compassed me with his
scourges.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I cry suffering violence, and no one will hear: I
shall cry aloud, and there is none to judge.</span></li>
<li><span>He hath hedged in my path round about, and I cannot pass,
and in my way he hath set darkness.</span></li>
<li><span>He hath stripped me of my glory, and hath taken the crown
from my head.</span></li>
<li><span>He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am lost, and he
hath taken away my hope, as from a tree that is plucked
up.</span></li>
<li><span>His wrath is kindled against me, and he hath counted me
as his enemy.</span></li>
<li><span>His troops have come together, and have made themselves a
way by me, and have besieged my tabernacle round about.</span></li>
<li><span>He hath put my brethren far from me, and my acquaintance
like strangers have departed from me.</span></li>
<li><span>My kinsmen have forsaken me, and they that knew me, have
forgotten me.</span></li>
<li><span>They that dwelt in my house, and my maidservants have
counted me a stranger, and I have been like an alien in their
eyes.</span></li>
<li><span>I called my servant, and he gave me no answer, I
entreated him with my own mouth.</span></li>
<li><span>My wife hath abhorred my breath, and I entreated the
children of my womb.</span></li>
<li><span>Even fools despise me; and when I gone from them, they
spoke against me.</span></li>

<li><span>Have pity on me, have pity on me, at least you my

<li><span>Why do you persecute me as God, and glut yourselves with
my flesh?</span></li>
<li><span>Who will grant me that my words may be written? Who will
grant me that they may be marked down in a book?</span></li>
<li><span>With an iron pen and in a plate of lead, or else be

and the spirit of my understanding shall answer for me.</span></li>
<li><span>This I know from the beginning, since man was placed upon
the earth,</span></li>
<li><span>that the praise of the wicked is short, and the joy of
the hypocrite but for a moment.</span></li>
<li><span>If his pride mount up even to heaven, and his head touch
the clouds:</span></li>
<li><span>In the end he shall be destroyed like a dunghill, and
they that has seen him shall say: Where is he?</span></li>
<li><span>As a dream that fleeth away he shall not be found, he
shall pass as a vision of the night:</span></li>
<li><span>The eyes that had seen him, shall see him no more,
neither shall his place any more behold him.</span></li>
<li><span>His children shall be oppressed with want, and his hands
shall render him his sorrow.</span></li>
<li><span>His bones shall be filled with the vices of his youth,
and they shall sleep with him in the dust.</span></li>
<li><span>For when evil shall be sweet in his mouth, he will hide
it under his tongue.</span></li>
<li><span>He will spare it, and not leave it, and will hide it in
his throat.</span></li>
<li><span>His bread in his belly shall be turned into the gall of
asps within him.</span></li>

and God shall draw them out of his belly.</span></li>
<li><span>He shall suck the head of asps, and the viper's tongue
shall kill him.</span></li>
<li><span>(Let him not see the streams of the river, the brooks of
honey and of butter.)</span></li>
<li><span>He shall be punished for all that he did, and yet shall
not be consumed: according to the multitude of his devices so also
shall he suffer.</span></li>
<li><span>Because he broke in and stripped the poor: he hath
violently taken away a house which he did not build.</span></li>
<li><span>And yet his belly was not filled: and when he hath the
things he coveted, he shall not be able to possess
them.</span></li>
<li><span>There was nothing left of his meat, and therefore nothing
shall continue of his goods:</span></li>
<li><span>When he shall be filled, he shall be straitened, he shall
burn, and every sorrow shall fall upon him.</span></li>
<li><span>May his belly be filled, that God may send forth the
wrath of his indignation upon him, and rain down his war upon
him.</span></li>
<li><span>He shall flee from weapons of iron, and shall fall upon a
bow of brass.</span></li>
<li><span>The sword is drawn out, and cometh forth from its
scabbard, and glittereth in his bitterness: the terrible ones shall
go and come upon him.</span></li>
<li><span>All darkness is hid in his secret places: a fire that is
not kindled shall devour him, he shall be afflicted when left in
his tabernacle.</span></li>
<li><span>The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, and the earth
shall rise up against him.</span></li>
<li><span>The offspring of his house shall be exposed, he shall be
pulled down in the day of God's wrath.</span></li>

<li><span>Hearken to me and be astonished, and lay your finger on

<li><span>As for me, when I remember, I am afraid, and trembling

strengthened with riches?</span></li>
<li><span>Their seed continueth before them, a multitude of
kinsmen, and of children's children in their sight.</span></li>

dance and play.</span></li>
<li><span>They take the timbrel, and the harp, and rejoice at the

<li><span>Yet because their good things are not in their hand, may
the counsel of the wicked be far from me.</span></li>
<li><span>How often shall the lamp of the wicked be put out, and a
deluge come upon them, and he shall distribute the sorrows of his
wrath?</span></li>
<li><span>They shall be as chaff before the face of the wind, and
as ashes which the whirlwind scattereth.</span></li>
<li><span>God shall lay up the sorrow of the father for his

<li><span>His eyes shall see his own destruction, and he shall
drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</span></li>
<li><span>For what is it to him what befalleth his house after him:
and if the number of his months be diminished by one
half?</span></li>
<li><span>Shall any one teach God knowledge, who judgeth those that
are high?</span></li>
<li><span>One man dieth strong, and hale, rich and
happy.</span></li>
<li><span>His bowels are full of fat, and his bones are moistened
with marrow.</span></li>
<li><span>But another dieth in bitterness of soul without any
riches:</span></li>
<li><span>And yet they shall sleep together in the dust, and worms
shall cover them.</span></li>
<li><span>Surely I know your thoughts, and your unjust judgments
against me.</span></li>

are the dwelling places of the wicked?</span></li>

destruction, and he shall be brought to the day of
wrath.</span></li>
<li><span>Who shall reprove his way to his face? and who shall
repay him what he hath done?</span></li>
<li><span>He shall be brought to the graves, and shall watch in the
heap of the dead.</span></li>
<li><span>He hath been acceptable to the gravel of Cocytus, and he
shall draw every man after him, and there are innumerable before

iniquities?</span></li>
<li><span>For thou hast taken away the pledge of thy brethren
without cause, and stripped the naked of their
clothing.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast not given water to the weary, thou hast
withdrawn bread from the hungry.</span></li>
<li><span>In the strength of thy arm thou didst possess the land,

come even to his throne?</span></li>
<li><span>I would set judgment before him, and would fill my mouth
with complaints.</span></li>

understand what he would say to me.</span></li>

strength, nor overwhelm me with the weight of his

<li><span>Let him propose equity against me, and let my judgment
come to victory.</span></li>
<li><span>But if I go to the east, he appeareth not; if to the
west, I shall not understand him.</span></li>
<li><span>If to the left hand, what shall I do? I shall not take

force, and fed them.</span></li>
<li><span>They have driven away the ass of the fatherless, and have
taken away the widow's ox for a pledge.</span></li>
<li><span>They have overturned the way of the poor, and have
oppressed together the meek of the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>Others like wild asses in the desert go forth to their
work: by watching for a prey they get bread for their
children.</span></li>
<li><span>They reap the field that is not their own, and gather the
vintage of his vineyard whom by violence they have
oppressed.</span></li>
<li><span>They send men away naked, taking away their clothes who
have no covering in the cold:</span></li>
<li><span>Who are wet, with the showers of the mountains, and

thirst.</span></li>
<li><span>Out of the cities they have made men to groan, and the

<li><span>In the rocks he hath cut out rivers, and his eye hath
seen every precious thing.</span></li>
<li><span>The depths also of rivers he hath searched, and hidden
things he hath brought forth to light.</span></li>
<li><span>But where is wisdom to be found, and where is the place
of understanding?</span></li>
<li><span>Man knoweth not the price thereof, neither is it found in
the land of them that live in delights.</span></li>
<li><span>The depth saith: It is not in me: and the sea saith: It
is not with me.</span></li>
<li><span>The finest gold shall not purchase it, neither shall
silver be weighed in exchange for it</span></li>
<li><span>It shall not be compared with the dyed colours of India,
or with the most precious stone sardonyx, or the
sapphire.</span></li>
<li><span>Gold or crystal cannot equal it, neither shall any
vessels of gold be changed for it.</span></li>
<li><span>High and eminent things shall not be mentioned in
comparison of it: but wisdom is drawn out of secret
places.</span></li>
<li><span>The topaz of Ethiopia shall not be equal to it, neither
shall it be compared to the cleanest dyeing.</span></li>
<li><span>Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of
understanding?</span></li>
<li><span>It is hid from the eyes of all living. and the fowls of
the air know it not.</span></li>
<li><span>Destruction and death have said: With our ears we have
heard the fame thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>God understandeth the way of it, and he knoweth the place
thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>For he beholdeth the ends of the world: and looketh on
all things that are under heaven.</span></li>
<li><span>Who made a weight for the winds and weighed the waters by
measure.</span></li>
<li><span>When he gave a law for the rain, and a way for the
sounding storms.</span></li>
<li><span>Then he saw it, and declared, and prepared, and searched
it.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to man: Behold the fear of the Lord, that is
wisdom: and to depart from evil, is understanding.</span></li>

<li><span>Job also added, taking up his parable, and
said:</span></li>
<li><span>Who will grant me, that I might be according to the
months past, according to the days in which God kept
me?</span></li>
<li><span>When his lamp shined over my head, and I walked by his
light in darkness?</span></li>
<li><span>As I was in the days of my youth, when God was secretly
in my tabernacle?</span></li>
<li><span>When the Almighty was with me: and my servants round
about me?</span></li>
<li><span>When I washed my feet with butter, and the rock poured me
out rivers of oil?</span></li>
<li><span>When I went out to the gate of the city, and in the
street they prepared me a chair?</span></li>
<li><span>The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the old men
rose up and stood.</span></li>
<li><span>The princes ceased to speak, and laid the finger on their
mouth.</span></li>
<li><span>The rulers held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to
their throat.</span></li>
<li><span>The ear that heard me blessed me, and the eye that saw me
gave witness to me:</span></li>
<li><span>Because I had delivered the poor man that cried out; and
the fatherless that had no helper.</span></li>
<li><span>The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon
me, and I comforted the heart of the widow.</span></li>
<li><span>I was clad with justice: and I clothed myself with my
judgment, as with a robe and a diadem.</span></li>
<li><span>I was an eye to the blind, and a foot to the
lame.</span></li>
<li><span>I was the father of the poor: and the cause which I knew
not, I searched out most diligently.</span></li>
<li><span>I broke the jaws of the wicked man, and out of his teeth
I took away the prey.</span></li>
<li><span>And I said: I shall die in my nest, and as a palm tree
shall multiply my days.</span></li>
<li><span>My root is opened beside the waters, and dew shall
continue in my harvest.</span></li>
<li><span>My glory shall always be renewed, and my bow in my hand
shall be repaired.</span></li>
<li><span>They that heard me, waited for my sentence, and being
attentive held their peace at my counsel.</span></li>
<li><span>To my words they durst add nothing, and my speech dropped
upon them.</span></li>
<li><span>They waited for me as for rain, and they opened their
mouth as for a latter shower.</span></li>
<li><span>If at any time I laughed on them, they believed not, and
the light of my countenance fell not on earth.</span></li>
<li><span>If I had a mind to go to them, I sat first, and when I
sat as a king, with his army standing about him, yet I was a
comforter of them that mourned.</span></li>

<li><span>But now the younger in time scorn me, whose fathers I
would not have set with the dogs of my flock:</span></li>
<li><span>The strength of whose hands was to me as nothing, and
they were thought unworthy of life itself.</span></li>
<li><span>Barren with want and hunger, who gnawed in the
wilderness, disfigured with calamity and misery.</span></li>
<li><span>And they ate grass, and barks of trees, and the root of
junipers was their food.</span></li>
<li><span>Who snatched up these things out of the valleys, and when
they had found any of them, they ran to them with a
cry.</span></li>
<li><span>They dwelt in the desert places of torrents, and in caves
of earth, or upon the gravel.</span></li>
<li><span>They pleased themselves among these kind of things, and
counted it delightful to be under the briers.</span></li>
<li><span>The children of foolish and base men, and not appearing
at all upon the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>Now I am turned into their song, and am become their

<li><span>They abhor me, and flee far from me, and are not afraid
to spit in my face.</span></li>
<li><span>For he hath opened his quiver, and hath afflicted me, and
hath put a bridle into my mouth.</span></li>
<li><span>At the right hand of my rising, my calamities forthwith
arose: they have overthrown my feet, and have overwhelmed me with
their paths as with waves.</span></li>
<li><span>They have destroyed my ways, they have lain in wait
against me, and they have prevailed, and there was none to
help.</span></li>
<li><span>They have rushed in upon me, as when a wall is broken,
and a gate opened, and have rolled themselves down to my
miseries.</span></li>
<li><span>I am brought to nothing: as a wind thou hast taken away
my desire: and my prosperity hath passed away like a
cloud.</span></li>
<li><span>And now my soul fadeth within myself, and the days of
affliction possess me.</span></li>
<li><span>In the night my bone is pierced with sorrows: and they
that feed upon me, do not sleep.</span></li>
<li><span>With the multitude of them my garment is consumed, and
they have girded me about, as with the collar of my
coat.</span></li>
<li><span>I am compared to dirt, and am likened to embers and
ashes.</span></li>
<li><span>I cry to thee, and thou hearest me not: I stand up, and
thou dost not regard me.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou art changed to be cruel toward me, and in the
hardness of thy hand thou art against me.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou hast lifted me up, and set me as it were upon the
wind, and thou hast mightily dashed me.</span></li>
<li><span>I know that thou wilt deliver me to death, where a house
is appointed for every one that liveth.</span></li>
<li><span>But yet thou stretchest not forth thy hand to their
consumption: and if they shall fall down thou wilt
save.</span></li>
<li><span>I wept heretofore for him that was afflicted, and my soul
had compassion on the poor.</span></li>
<li><span>I expected good things, and evils are come upon me: I
waited for light, and darkness broke out.</span></li>
<li><span>My inner parts have boiled without any rest, the days of
affliction have prevented me.</span></li>
<li><span>I went mourning without indignation; I rose up, and cried
in the crowd.</span></li>
<li><span>I was the brother of dragons, and companion of
ostriches.</span></li>
<li><span>My skin is become black upon me, and my bones are dried
up with heat.</span></li>

<li><span>I made a covenant with my eyes, that I would not so much
as think upon a virgin.</span></li>
<li><span>For what part should God from above have in me, and what
inheritance the Almighty from on high?</span></li>
<li><span>Is not destruction to the wicked, and aversion to them
that work iniquity?</span></li>
<li><span>Doth not he consider my ways, and number all my
steps?</span></li>
<li><span>If I have walked in vanity, and my foot hath made haste
to deceit:</span></li>
<li><span>Let him weigh me in a just balance, and let God know my
simplicity.</span></li>
<li><span>If my step hath turned out of the way, and if my heart
hath followed my eyes, and if a spot hath cleaved to my
hands:</span></li>
<li><span>Then let me sow and let another eat: and let my offspring
be rooted out.</span></li>
<li><span>If my heart hath been deceived upon a woman, and if I
have laid wait at my friend's door:</span></li>
<li><span>Let my wife be the harlot of another, and let other men
lie with her.</span></li>
<li><span>For this is a heinous crime, and a most grievous
iniquity.</span></li>
<li><span>It is a fire that devoureth even to destruction, and
rooteth up all things that spring.</span></li>
<li><span>If I have despised to abide judgment with my manservant,
or my maidservant, when they had any controversy against
me:</span></li>
<li><span>For what shall I do when God shall rise to judge? and
when he shall examine, what shall I answer him?</span></li>
<li><span>Did not he that made me in the womb make him also: and
did not one and the same form me in the womb?</span></li>
<li><span>If I have denied to the poor what they desired, and have
made the eyes of the widow wait:</span></li>
<li><span>If I have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless hath
not eaten thereof:</span></li>
<li><span>(For from my infancy mercy grew up with me: and it came
out with me from my mother's womb :)</span></li>
<li><span>If I have despised him that was perishing for want of
clothing, and the poor man that had no covering:</span></li>
<li><span>If his sides have not blessed me, and if he were not
warmed with the fleece of my sheep:</span></li>
<li><span>If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, even
when I saw myself superior in the gate:</span></li>
<li><span>Let my shoulder fall from its joint, and let my arm with
its bones be broken.</span></li>
<li><span>For I have always feared God as waves swelling over me,
and his weight I was not able to bear.</span></li>
<li><span>If I have thought gold my strength, and have said to fine
gold: My confidence:</span></li>
<li><span>If I have rejoiced over my great riches, and because my
hand had gotten much.</span></li>
<li><span>If I beheld the sun when it shined, and the moon going in
brightness:</span></li>
<li><span>And my heart in secret hath rejoiced, and I have kissed
my hand with my mouth:</span></li>
<li><span>Which is a very great iniquity, and a denial against the
most high God.</span></li>
<li><span>If I have been glad at the downfall of him that hated me,
and have rejoiced that evil had found him.</span></li>
<li><span>For I have not given my mouth to sin, by wishing a curse
to his soul.</span></li>
<li><span>If the men of my tabernacle have not said: Who will give
us of his flesh that we may be filled?</span></li>
<li><span>The stranger did not stay without, my door was open to
the traveller.</span></li>
<li><span>If as a man I have hid my sin, and have concealed my
iniquity in my bosom.</span></li>
<li><span>If I have been afraid at a very great multitude, and the
contempt of kinsmen hath terrified me: and I have not rather held
my peace, and not gone out of the door.</span></li>
<li><span>Who would grant me a hearer, that the Almighty may hear
my desire; and that he himself that judgeth would write a
book,</span></li>
<li><span>That I may carry it on my shoulder, and put it about me
as a crown?</span></li>
<li><span>At every step of mine I would pronounce it, and offer it
as to a prince.</span></li>
<li><span>If my land cry against me, and with it the furrows
thereof mourn:</span></li>
<li><span>If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, and
have afflicted the soul of the tillers thereof:</span></li>
<li><span>Let thistles grow up to me instead of wheat, and thorns
instead of barley.</span></li>

<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="32">Job 32</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he
seemed just to himself.</span></li>
<li><span>And Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred
of Ram, was angry and was moved to indignation : now he was angry
against Job, because he said he was just before God.</span></li>
<li><span>And he was angry with his friends because they had not
found a reasonable answer, but only had condemned Job.</span></li>
<li><span>So Eliu waited while Job was speaking, because they were
his elders that were speaking.</span></li>
<li><span>But when he saw that the three were not able to answer,
he was exceedingly angry.</span></li>
<li><span>Then Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and
said : I am younger in days, and you are more ancient; therefore
hanging down my head, I was afraid to shew you my
opinion.</span></li>
<li><span>For I hoped that greater age would speak, and that a
multitude of years would teach wisdom.</span></li>
<li><span>But, as I see, there is a spirit in men, and the
inspiration of the Almighty giveth understanding.</span></li>
<li><span>They that are aged are not the wise men, neither do the
ancients understand judgment.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore I will speak : Hearken to me, I also will shew
you my wisdom.</span></li>
<li><span>For I have waited for your words, I have given ear to
your wisdom, as long as you were disputing in words.</span></li>
<li><span>And as long as I thought you said some thing, I
considered : but, as I see, there is none of you that can convince
Job, and answer his words.</span></li>
<li><span>Lest you should say : We have found wisdom, God hath cast
him down, not man.</span></li>
<li><span>He hath spoken nothing to me, and I will not answer him
according to your words.</span></li>
<li><span>They were afraid, and answered no more, and they left off
speaking.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore because I have waited, and they have not spoken
: they stood, and answered no more :</span></li>
<li><span>I also will answer my part, and will shew my
knowledge.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold, my belly is as new wine which wanteth vent, which
bursteth the new vessels.</span></li>
<li><span>I will speak and take breath a little : I will open my
lips, and will answer.</span></li>
<li><span>I will not accept the person of man, and I will not level
God with man.</span></li>
<li><span>For I know not how long I shall continue, and whether
after a while my Maker may take me away.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="33">Job 33</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Hear therefore, O Job, my speeches, and hearken to all my
words.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold now I have opened my mouth, let my tongue speak
within my jaws.</span></li>
<li><span>My words are from my upright heart, and my lips shall
speak a pure sentence.</span></li>
<li><span>The spirit of God made me, and the breath of the Almighty
gave me life.</span></li>
<li><span>If thou canst, answer me, and stand up against my
face.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold God hath made me as well as thee, and of the same
clay I also was formed.</span></li>
<li><span>But yet let not my wonder terrify thee, and let not my
eloquence be burdensome to thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Now thou has said in my hearing, and I have heard the
voice of thy words :</span></li>
<li><span>I am clean, and without sin : I am unspotted, and there
is no iniquity in me.</span></li>
<li><span>Because he hath found complaints against me, therefore he
hath counted me for his enemy.</span></li>
<li><span>He hath put my feet in the stocks, he hath observed all
my paths.</span></li>
<li><span>Now this is the thing in which thou art not justified : I
will answer thee, that God is greater than man.</span></li>
<li><span>Dost thou strive against him, because he hath not
answered thee to all words?</span></li>
<li><span>God speaketh once, and repeateth not the selfsame thing
the second time.</span></li>
<li><span>By a dream in a vision by night, when deep sleep falleth
upon men, and they are sleeping in their beds :</span></li>
<li><span>Then he openeth the ears of men, and teaching instructeth
them in what they are to learn.</span></li>
<li><span>That he may withdraw a man from the things he is doing,
and may deliver him from pride.</span></li>
<li><span>Rescuing his soul from corruption : and his life from
passing to the sword.</span></li>
<li><span>He rebuketh also by sorrow in the bed, and he maketh all
his bones to wither.</span></li>
<li><span>Bread becometh abominable to him in his life, and to his
soul the meat which before he desired.</span></li>
<li><span>His flesh shall be consumed away, and his bones that were
covered shall be made bare.</span></li>
<li><span>His soul hath drawn near to corruption, and his life to
the destroyers.</span></li>
<li><span>If there shall be an angel speaking for him, one among
thousands, to declare man's uprightness,</span></li>
<li><span>He shall have mercy on him, and shall say : Deliver him,
that he may not go down to corruption : I have found wherein I may
be merciful to him.</span></li>
<li><span>His flesh is consumed with punishment, let him return to
the days of his youth.</span></li>
<li><span>He shall pray to God, and he will be gracious to him :
and he shall see his face with joy, and he will render to man his
justice.</span></li>
<li><span>He shall look upon men, and shall say : I have sinned,
and indeed I have offended, and I have not received what I have
deserved.</span></li>
<li><span>He hath delivered his soul from going into destruction,
that it may live and see the light.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold, all these things God worketh three times within
every one.</span></li>
<li><span>That he may withdraw their souls from corruption, and
enlighten them with the light of the living.</span></li>
<li><span>Attend, Job, and hearken to me : and hold thy peace,
whilst I speak.</span></li>
<li><span>But if thou hast any thing to say, answer me, speak : for
I would have thee to appear just.</span></li>

will teach thee wisdom.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="34">Job 34</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And Eliu continued his discourse, and said :</span></li>
<li><span>Hear ye, wise men, my words, and ye learned, hearken to
me :</span></li>
<li><span>For the ear trieth words, and the mouth discerneth meats
by the taste.</span></li>
<li><span>Let us choose to us judgment, and let us see among
ourselves what is the best.</span></li>
<li><span>For Job hath said : I am just, and God hath overthrown my
judgment.</span></li>
<li><span>For in judging me there is a lie : my arrow is violent
without any sin.</span></li>
<li><span>What man is there like Job, who drinketh up scorning like
water?</span></li>
<li><span>Who goeth in company with them that work iniquity, and
walketh with wicked men?</span></li>
<li><span>For he hath said : Man shall not please God, although he
run with him.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore, ye men of understanding, hear me : far from
god be wickedness, and iniquity from the Almighty.</span></li>
<li><span>For he will render to a man his work, and according to
the ways of every one he will reward them.</span></li>
<li><span>For in very deed God will not condemn without cause,
neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</span></li>
<li><span>What other hath he appointed over the earth? or whom hath
he set over the world which he made?</span></li>
<li><span>If he turn his heart to him, he shall draw his spirit and
breath unto himself.</span></li>
<li><span>All flesh shall perish together, and man shall return
into ashes.</span></li>
<li><span>If then thou hast understanding, hear what is said, and
hearken to the voice of my words.</span></li>
<li><span>Can he be healed that loveth not judgment? and how dost
thou so far condemn him that is just?</span></li>
<li><span>Who saith to the king : Thou art an apostate : who
calleth rulers ungodly?</span></li>
<li><span>Who accepteth not the persons of princes : nor hath
regarded the tyrant, when he contended against the poor man : for
all are the work of his hands.</span></li>
<li><span>They shall suddenly die, and the people shall be troubled
at midnight, and they shall pass, and take away the violent without
hand.</span></li>
<li><span>For his eyes are upon the ways of men, and he considereth
all their steps.</span></li>
<li><span>There is no darkness, and there is no shadow of death,
where they may be hid who work iniquity.</span></li>
<li><span>For it is no longer in the power of man to enter into
judgment with God.</span></li>
<li><span>He shall break in pieces many and innumerable, and shall
make others to stand in their stead.</span></li>
<li><span>For he knoweth their works : and therefore he shall bring
night on them, and they shall be destroyed.</span></li>
<li><span>He hath struck them, as being wicked, in open
sight.</span></li>
<li><span>Who as it were on purpose have revolted from him, and
would not understand all his ways :</span></li>
<li><span>So that they caused the cry of the needy to come to him,
and he heard the voice of the poor.</span></li>
<li><span>For when he granteth peace, who is there that can
condemn? When he hideth his countenance, who is there that can
behold him, whether it regard nations, or all men?</span></li>
<li><span>Who maketh a man that is a hypocrite to reign for the
sins of the people?</span></li>
<li><span>Seeing then I have spoken of God, I will not hinder thee
in thy turn.</span></li>
<li><span>If I have erred, teach thou me : if I have spoken
iniquity, I will add no more.</span></li>
<li><span>Doth God require it of thee, because it hath displeased
thee? for thou begannest to speak, and not I. : but if thou know
any thing better, speak.</span></li>
<li><span>Let men of understanding speak to me, and let a wise man
hearken to me.</span></li>
<li><span>But Job hath spoken foolishly, and his words sound not
discipline.</span></li>
<li><span>My father, let Job be tried even to the end : cease not
from the man of iniquity.</span></li>
<li><span>Because he addeth blasphemy upon his sins, let him be
tied fast in the mean time amongst us : and then let him provoke
God to judgment with his speeches.</span></li>

<li><span>Moreover Eliu spoke these words :</span></li>
<li><span>Doth thy thought seem right to thee, that thou shouldst
say : I am more just than God?</span></li>
<li><span>For thou saidst : That which is right doth not please
thee : or what will it profit thee if I sin?</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore I will answer thy words, and thy friends with
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Look up to heaven and see, and behold the sky, that it is
higher than thee.</span></li>
<li><span>If thou sin, what shalt thou hurt him? and if thy
iniquities be multiplied, what shalt thou do against
him?</span></li>
<li><span>And if thou do justly, what shalt thou give him, or what
shall he receive of thy hand?</span></li>
<li><span>Thy wickedness may hurt a man that is like thee : and thy
justice may help the son of man.</span></li>
<li><span>By reason of the multitude of oppressions they shall cry
out : and shall wail for the violence of the arm of
tyrants.</span></li>
<li><span>And he hath not said : Where is God, who made me, who
hath given songs in the night?</span></li>
<li><span>Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and
instructeth us more than the fowls of the air.</span></li>
<li><span>There shall they cry, and he will not hear, because of
the pride of evil men.</span></li>
<li><span>God therefore will not hear in vain, and the Almighty
will look into the causes of every one.</span></li>
<li><span>Yea when thou shalt say : He considereth not : be judged
before him, and expect him.</span></li>
<li><span>For he doth not now bring on his fury, neither doth he
revenge wickedness exceedingly.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore Job openeth his mouth in vain, and multiplieth
words without knowledge.</span></li>

placeth kings on the throne for ever, and they are
exalted.</span></li>
<li><span>And if they shall be in chains, and be bound with the
cords of poverty :</span></li>

their days in good, and their years in glory.</span></li>
<li><span>But if they hear not, they shall pass by the sword, and
shall be consumed in folly.</span></li>
<li><span>Dissemblers and crafty men prove the wrath of God,
neither shall they cry when they are bound.</span></li>
<li><span>Their soul shall die in a storm, and their life among the
effeminate.</span></li>
<li><span>He shall deliver the poor out of his distress, and shall
open his ear in affliction.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore he shall set thee at large out of the narrow
mouth, and which hath no foundation under it : and the rest of thy
table shall be full of fatness.</span></li>
<li><span>Thy cause hath been judged as that of the wicked, cause
and judgment thou shalt recover.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore let not anger overcome thee to oppress any man
: neither let multitude of gifts turn thee aside.</span></li>
<li><span>Lay down thy greatness without tribulation, and all the
mighty of strength.</span></li>
<li><span>Prolong not the night that people may come up for
them.</span></li>
<li><span>Beware thou turn not aside to iniquity : for this thou
hast begun to follow after misery.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold, God is high in his strength, and none is like him
among the lawgivers.</span></li>
<li><span>Who can search out his ways? or who can say to him : Thou
has wrought iniquity?</span></li>
<li><span>Remember that thou knowest not his work, concerning which
men have sung.</span></li>
<li><span>All men see him, every one beholdeth afar
off.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold, God is great, exceeding our knowledge : the
number of his years is inestimable.</span></li>
<li><span>He lifteth up the drops of rain, and poureth out showers
like floods :</span></li>
<li><span>Which flow from the clouds that cover all
above.</span></li>
<li><span>If he will spread out clouds as his tent,</span></li>
<li><span>And lighten with his light from above, he shall cover
also the ends of the sea.</span></li>
<li><span>For by these he judgeth people, and giveth food to many
mortals.</span></li>
<li><span>In his hands he hideth the light, and commandeth it to
come again.</span></li>
<li><span>He sheweth his friend concerning it, that it is his
possession, and that he may come up to it.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span>At this my heart trembleth, and is moved out of its
place.</span></li>
<li><span>Hear ye attentively the terror of his voice, and the
sound that cometh out of his mouth.</span></li>
<li><span>He beholdeth under all the heavens, and his light is upon
the ends of the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>After it a noise shall roar, he shall thunder with the
voice of his majesty, and shall not be found out, when his voice
shall be heard.</span></li>
<li><span>God shall thunder wonderfully with his voice, he that
doth great and unsearchable things.</span></li>
<li><span>He commandeth the snow to go down upon the earth, and the
winter rain, and the shower of his strength.</span></li>
<li><span>He sealeth up the hand of all men, that every one may
know his works.</span></li>
<li><span>Then the beast shall go into his covert, and shall abide
in his den.</span></li>
<li><span>Out of the inner parts shall a tempest come, and cold out
of the north.</span></li>
<li><span>When God bloweth there cometh frost, and again the waters
are poured out abundantly.</span></li>
<li><span>Corn desireth clouds, and the clouds spread their light
:</span></li>
<li><span>Which go round about, whithersoever the will of him that
governeth them shall lead them, to whatsoever he shall command them
upon the face of the whole earth :</span></li>
<li><span>Whether in one tribe, or in his own land, or in what
place soever of his mercy he shall command them to be
found.</span></li>
<li><span>Hearken to these things, Job : Stand, and consider the
wondrous works of God.</span></li>
<li><span>Dost thou know when God commanded the rains, to shew his
light of his clouds?</span></li>
<li><span>Knowest thou the great paths of the clouds, and the
perfect knowledges?</span></li>
<li><span>Are not thy garments hot, when the south wind blows upon
the earth?</span></li>
<li><span>Thou perhaps hast made the heavens with him, which are
most strong, as if they were of molten brass.</span></li>
<li><span>Shew us what we may say to him : for we are wrapped up in
darkness.</span></li>
<li><span>Who shall tell him the things I speak? even if a man
shall speak, he shall be swallowed up.</span></li>
<li><span>But now they see not the light : the air on a sudden
shall be thickened into clouds, and the wind shall pass and drive
them away.</span></li>
<li><span>Cold cometh out of the north, and to God praise with
fear.</span></li>
<li><span>We cannot find him worthily : he is great in strength,
and in judgment, and in justice, and he is ineffable.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore men shall fear him, and all that seem to
themselves to be wise, shall not dare to behold him.</span></li>

<li><span>Then the Lord answered Job out of a whirlwind, and said
:</span></li>
<li><span>Who is this that wrappeth up sentences in unskillful
words?</span></li>
<li><span>Gird up thy loins like a man : I will ask thee, and
answer thou me.</span></li>
<li><span>Where wast thou when I laid up the foundations of the
earth ? tell me if thou hast understanding.</span></li>
<li><span>Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or
who hath stretched the line upon it?</span></li>
<li><span>Upon what are its bases grounded? or who laid the corner
stone thereof,</span></li>
<li><span>When the morning stars praised me together, and all the
sons of God made a joyful melody?</span></li>
<li><span>Who shut up the sea with doors, when it broke forth as
issuing out of the womb :</span></li>
<li><span>when I made a cloud the garment thereof, and wrapped it
in a mist as in swaddling bands?</span></li>
<li><span>I set my bounds around it, and made it bars and doors
:</span></li>
<li><span>And I said : Hitherto thou shalt come, and shalt go no
further, and here thou shalt break thy swelling waves.</span></li>
<li><span>Didst thou since thy birth command the morning, and shew
the dawning of the day its place?</span></li>
<li><span>And didst thou hold the extremities of the earth shaking
them, and hast thou shaken the ungodly out of it?</span></li>
<li><span>The seal shall be restored as clay, and shall stand as a
garment :</span></li>
<li><span>From the wicked their light shall be taken away, and the
high arm shall be broken.</span></li>
<li><span>Hast thou entered into the depths of the sea, and walked
in the lowest parts of the deep?</span></li>
<li><span>Have the gates of death been opened to thee, and hast
thou seen the darksome doors?</span></li>
<li><span>Hast thou considered the breadth of the earth? tell me,
if thou knowest all things?</span></li>
<li><span>Where is the way where light dwelleth, and where is the
place of darkness :</span></li>
<li><span>That thou mayst bring every thing to its own bounds, and
understand the paths of the house thereof.</span></li>

didst thou know the number of thy days?</span></li>
<li><span>Hast thou entered into the storehouses of the snow, or
has thou beheld the treasures of the hail :</span></li>

the day of battle and war?</span></li>
<li><span>By what way is the light spread, and heat divided upon
the earth?</span></li>
<li><span>Who gave a course to violent showers, or a way for noisy
thunder :</span></li>
<li><span>That it should rain on the earth without man in the
wilderness, where no mortal dwelleth :</span></li>
<li><span>That it should fill the desert and desolate land, and
should bring forth green grass?</span></li>
<li><span>Who is the father of rain ? or who begot the drops of
dew?</span></li>
<li><span>Out of whose womb came the ice; and the frost from heaven
who hath gendered it?</span></li>
<li><span>The waters are hardened like a stone, and the surface of
the deep is congealed.</span></li>
<li><span>Shalt thou be able to join together the shining stars the
Pleiades, or canst thou stop the turning about of
Arcturus?</span></li>
<li><span>Canst thou bring forth the day star in its time, and make
the evening star to rise upon the children of the
earth?</span></li>
<li><span>Dost thou know the order of heaven, and canst thou set
down the reason thereof on the earth?</span></li>
<li><span>Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that an
abundance of waters may cover thee?</span></li>
<li><span>Canst thou send lightnings, and will they go, and will
they return and say to thee : Here we are?</span></li>
<li><span>Who hath put wisdom in the heart of man? or who gave the
cock understanding?</span></li>
<li><span>Who can declare the order of the heavens, or who can make
the harmony of heaven to sleep?</span></li>
<li><span>When was the dust poured on the earth, and the clods
fastened together?</span></li>
<li><span>Wilt thou take the prey for the lioness, and satisfy the
appetite of her whelps,</span></li>
<li><span>When they couch in the dens and lie in wait in
holes?</span></li>

<li><span>They bow themselves to bring forth young, and they cast
them, and send forth roarings.</span></li>

and return not to them.</span></li>
<li><span>Who hath sent out the wild ass free, and who hath loosed
his bonds?</span></li>
<li><span>To whom I have given a house in the wilderness, and his
dwellings in the barren land.</span></li>
<li><span>He scorneth the multitude of the city, he heareth not the

warm them in the dust.</span></li>

the beasts of the field may break them.</span></li>
<li><span>She is hardened against her young ones, as though they
were not hers, she hath laboured in vain, no fear constraining
her.</span></li>
<li><span>For God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he
given her understanding.</span></li>
<li><span>When time shall be, she setteth up her wings on high :
she scorneth the horse and his rider.</span></li>
<li><span>Wilt thou give strength to the horse, or clothe his neck
with neighing?</span></li>
<li><span>Wilt thou lift him up like the locusts? the glory of his
nostrils is terror.</span></li>
<li><span>He breaketh up the earth with his hoof, he pranceth
boldly, he goeth forward to meet armed men.</span></li>
<li><span>He despiseth fear, he turneth not his back to the
sword,</span></li>
<li><span>Above him shall the quiver rattle, the spear and shield
shall glitter.</span></li>
<li><span>Chasing and raging he swalloweth the ground, neither doth
he make account when the noise of the trumpet soundeth.</span></li>
<li><span>When he heareth the trumpet he saith : Ha, ha : he
smelleth the battle afar off, the encouraging of the captains, and
the shouting of the army.</span></li>
<li><span>Doth the hawk wax feathered by thy wisdom, spreading her
wings to the south?</span></li>
<li><span>Will the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest
in high places?</span></li>
<li><span>She abideth among the rocks, and dwelleth among cragged
flints, and stony hills, where there is no access.</span></li>
<li><span>From thence she looketh for the prey, and her eyes behold
afar off.</span></li>
<li><span>Her young ones shall suck up blood : and wheresoever the
carcass shall be, she is immediately there.</span></li>

thou mayst be justified?</span></li>
<li><span>And hast thou an arm like God, and canst thou thunder
with a voice like him?</span></li>
<li><span>Clothe thyself with beauty, and set thyself up on high
and be glorious, and put on goodly garments.</span></li>
<li><span>Scatter the proud in thy indignation, and behold every
arrogant man, and humble him.</span></li>

the wicked in their place.</span></li>
<li><span>Hide them in the dust together, and plunge their faces

<li><span>Then I will confess that thy right hand is able to save
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold behemoth whom I made with thee, he eateth grass
like an ox.</span></li>
<li><span>His strength is in his loins, and his force in the navel
of his belly.</span></li>
<li><span>He setteth up his tail like a cedar, the sinews of his
testicles are wrapped together.</span></li>
<li><span>His bones are like pipes of brass, his gristle like
plates of iron.</span></li>
<li><span>He is the beginning of the ways of God, who made him, he

<li><span>To him the mountains bring forth grass : there all the
beasts of the field shall play.</span></li>

and in moist places.</span></li>
<li><span>The shades cover his shadow, the willows of the brook
shall compass him about.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold, he will drink up a river, and not wonder : and he
trusteth that the Jordan may run into his mouth.</span></li>
<li><span>In his eyes as with a hook he shall take him, and bore
through his nostrils with stakes.</span></li>
<li><span>Canst thou draw out the leviathan with a hook, or canst
thou tie his tongue with a cord?</span></li>
<li><span>Canst thou put a ring in his nose, or bore through his
jaw with a buckle?</span></li>
<li><span>Will he make many supplications to thee, or speak soft
words to thee?</span></li>
<li><span>Will he make a covenant with thee, and wilt thou take him
to be a servant for ever?</span></li>
<li><span>Shalt thou play with him as with a bird, or tie him up
for thy handmaids?</span></li>

him?</span></li>
<li><span>Wilt thou fill nets with his skin, and the cabins of
fishes with his head?</span></li>

<li><span>Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge?
Therefore I have spoken unwisely, and things that above measure
exceeded my knowledge.</span></li>
<li><span>Hear, and I will speak : I will ask thee, and do thou
tell me.</span></li>
<li><span>With the hearing of the ear, I have heard thee, but now
my eye seeth thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore I reprehend myself, and do penance in dust and
ashes.</span></li>
<li><span>And after the Lord had spoken these words to Job, he said
to Eliphaz the Themanite : My wrath is kindled against thee, and
against thy two friends, because you have not spoken the thing that
is right before my, as my servant Job hath.</span></li>
<li><span>Take unto you therefore seven oxen, and seven rams, and
go to my servant Job, and offer for yourselves a holocaust : and my
servant Job shall pray for you : his face I will accept, that folly
be not imputed to you : for you have not spoken right things before
me, as my servant Job hath.</span></li>
<li><span>So Eliphaz the Themanite, and Baldad the Suhite, and
Sophar the Naamathite went, and did as the Lord had spoken to them,
and the Lord accepted the face of Job.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord also was turned at the penance of Job, when he
prayed for his friends. And the Lord gave Job twice as much as he
had before.</span></li>
<li><span>And all his brethren came to him, and all his sisters,
and all that knew him before, and they ate bread with him in his
house : and bemoaned him, and comforted him upon all the evil that
God had brought upon him. And every man gave him one ewe, and one
earring of fold.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his
beginning. And he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand
camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she
asses.</span></li>
<li><span>And he had seven sons, and three daughters.</span></li>
<li><span>And he called the names of one Dies, and the name of the
second Cassia, and the name of the third Cornustibil.</span></li>
<li><span>And there were not found in all the earth women so
beautiful as the daughters of Job : and their father gave them
inheritance among their brethren.</span></li>
<li><span>And Job lived after these things, a hundred and forty
years, and he saw his children, and his children's children, unto
the fourth generation, and he died an old man, and full of
days.</span></li>
