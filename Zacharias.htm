<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="1">Zacharias 1</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>In the eighth month, in the second year of king Darius,
the word of the Lord came to Zacharias the son of Barachias, the
son of Addo, the prophet, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord hath been exceeding angry with your
fathers.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord of hosts:
Turn ye to me, saith the Lord of hosts: and I will turn to you,
saith the Lord of hosts.</span></li>
<li><span>Be not as your fathers, to whom the former prophets have
cried, saying: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Turn ye from your evil
ways, and from your wicked thoughts: but they did not give ear,
neither did they hearken to me, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, shall
they live always?</span></li>
<li><span>But yet my words, and my ordinances, which I gave in
charge to my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your
fathers, and they returned, and said: As the Lord of hosts thought
to do to us according to our ways, and according to our devices, so
he hath done to us.</span></li>
<li><span>In the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month which
is called Sabath, in the second year of Darius, the word of the
Lord came to Zacharias the son of Barachias, the son of Addo, the
prophet, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse,
and he stood among the myrtle trees, that were in the bottom: and
behind him were horses, red, speckled, and white.</span></li>
<li><span>And I said: What are these, my Lord ? and the angel that
spoke in me, said to me: I will shew thee what these
are:</span></li>
<li><span>And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered,
and said: These are they, whom the Lord hath sent to walk through
the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And they answered the angel of the Lord, that stood among
the myrtle trees, and said: We have walked through the earth, and
behold all the earth is inhabited, and is at rest.</span></li>
<li><span>And the angel of the Lord answered, and said: O Lord of
hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem, and on the
cities of Juda, with which thou hast been angry? this is now the
seventieth year.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord answered the angel, that spoke in me, good
words, comfortable words.</span></li>
<li><span>And the angel that spoke in me, said to me: Cry thou,
saying: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I am zealous for Jerusalem,
and Sion with a great zeal.</span></li>
<li><span>And I am angry with a great anger with the wealthy
nations: for I was angry a little, but they helped forward the
evil.</span></li>
<li><span>Therefore thus saith the Lord: I will return to Jerusalem
in mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the Lord of hosts:
and the building line shall be stretched forth upon
Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>Cry yet, saying: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: My cities
shall yet flow with good things : and the Lord will yet comfort
Sion, and he will yet choose Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And I lifted up my eyes, and saw: and behold four
horns.</span></li>
<li><span>And I said to the angel that spoke to me: What are these?
And he said to me: These are the horns that have scattered Juda,
and Israel, and Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord shewed me four smiths.</span></li>
<li><span>And I said: What come these to do? and he spoke, saying:
These are the horns which have scattered Juda every man apart, and
none of them lifted up his head: and these are come to fray them,
to cast down the horns of the nations, that have lifted up the horn
upon the land of Juda to scatter it.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="2">Zacharias 2</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold a man, with
a measuring line in his hand.</span></li>
<li><span>And I said: Whither goest thou? and he said to me: To
measure Jerusalem, and to see how great is the breadth thereof, and
how great the length thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>And behold the angel that spoke in me went forth, and
another angel went out to meet him.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to him: Run, speak to this young man, saying:
Jerusalem shall be inhabited without walls, by reason of the
multitude of men, and of the beasts in the midst
thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will be to it, saith the Lord, a wall of fire round
about: and I will be in glory in the midst thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>O, O flee ye out of the land of the north, saith the
Lord, for I have scattered you into the four winds of heaven, saith
the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>O Sion, flee, thou that dwellest with the daughter of
Babylon:</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord of hosts: After the glory he hath
sent me to the nations that have robbed you: for he that toucheth
you, toucheth the apple of my eye:</span></li>
<li><span>For behold I lift up my hand upon them, and they shall be
a prey to those that served them: and you shall know that the Lord
of hosts sent me.</span></li>
<li><span>Sing praise, and rejoice, O daughter of Sion: for behold
I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee: saith the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And many nations shall be joined to the Lord in that day,
and they shall be my people, and I will dwell in the midst of thee:
and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me to
thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord shall possess Juda his portion in the
sanctified land: and he shall yet choose Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>Let all flesh be silent at the presence of the Lord: for
he is risen up out of his .holy habitation.</span></li>
</ol>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="3">Zacharias 3</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And the Lord shewed me Jesus the high priest standing
before the angel of the Lord: and Satan stood on his right hand to
be his adversary.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to Satan: The Lord rebuke thee, O
Satan: and the Lord that chose Jerusalem rebuke thee: Is not this a
brand plucked out of the fire?</span></li>
<li><span>And Jesus was clothed with filthy garments: and he stood
before the face of the angel.</span></li>
<li><span>Who answered, and said to them that stood before him,
saying: Take away the filthy garments from him. And he said to him:
Behold I have taken away thy iniquity, and have clothed thee with
change of garments.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said: Put a clean mitre upon his head: and they
put a clean mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments, and
the angel of the Lord stood.</span></li>
<li><span>And the angel of the Lord protested to Jesus,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: If thou wilt walk in my
ways, and Beep my charge, thou also shalt judge my house, and shalt
keep my courts, and I will give thee some of them that are now
present here to walk with thee.</span></li>
<li><span>Hear, O Jesus thou high priest, then and thy friends that
dwell before thee, for they are portending men: for behold I WILL
BRING MY SERVANT THE ORIENT.</span></li>
<li><span>For behold the stone that I have laid before Jesus: upon
one stone there are seven eyes: behold I will grave the graving
thereof, saith the Lord of hosts: and I will take away the iniquity
of that land in one day.</span></li>
<li><span>In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, every man shell
call his friend under the vine and under the fig tree.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="4">Zacharias 4</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And the angel that spoke in me came again: and he waked
me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to me: What seest thou? And I said: I have
looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, and its lamp upon the
top of it: and the seven lights thereof upon it: and seven funnels
for the lights that were upon the top thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>And two olive trees over it: one upon the right side of
the lamp, and the other upon the left side thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>And I answered, and said to the angel that spoke in me,
saying: What are these things, my lord?</span></li>
<li><span>And the angel that spoke in me answered, and said to me:
Knowest thou not what these things are? And I said: No, my
lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And he answered, and spoke to me, saying: This is the
word of the Lord to Zorobabel, saying: Not with an army, nor by
might, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.</span></li>
<li><span>Who art thou, O great mountain, before Zorobabel? thou
shalt become a plain: and he shall bring out the chief stone, and
shall give equal grace to the grace thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</span></li>
<li><span>The hands of Zorobabel have laid the foundations of this
house, and his hands shall finish it: and you shall know that the
Lord of hosts hath sent me to you.</span></li>
<li><span>For who hath despised little days? and they shall
rejoice, and shall see the tin plummet in the hand of Zorobabel.
These are the seven eyes of the Lord, that run to and fro through
the whole earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And I answered, and said to him: What are these two olive
trees upon the right side of the candlestick, and upon the left
side thereof?</span></li>
<li><span>And I answered again, and said to him: What are the two
olive branches, that are by the two golden beaks, in which are the
funnels of gold?</span></li>
<li><span>And he spoke to me, saying: Knowest thou not what these
are? And I said: No, my lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said: These are two sons of oil who stand before
the Lord of the whole earth.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="5">Zacharias 5</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And I turned and lifted up my eyes: and I saw, and behold
a volume flying.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to me: What seest thou? And I said: I see a
volume flying: the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth
thereof ten cubits.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to me: This is the curse that goeth forth
over the face of the earth: for every thief shall be judged as is
there written: and every one that sweareth in like manner shall be
judged by it.</span></li>
<li><span>I will bring it forth, saith the Lord of hosts: and it
shall come to the house of the thief, and to the house of him that
sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of
his house, and shall consume it, with the timber thereof, and the
stones thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>And the angel went forth that spoke in me, and he said to
me: Lift up thy eyes, and see what this is, that goeth
forth.</span></li>
<li><span>And I said: What is it? And he said: This is a vessel
going forth. And he said: This is their eye in all the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And behold a talent of lead was carried, and behold a
woman sitting in the midst of the vessel.</span></li>
<li><span>And he said: This is wickedness. And he cast her into the
midst of the vessel, and cast the weight of lead upon the mouth
thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>And I lifted up my eyes and looked: and behold there came
out two women, and wind was in their wings, and they had wings like
the wings of a kite: and they lifted up the vessel between the
earth and the heaven.</span></li>
<li><span>And I said to the angel that spoke in me: Whither do
these carry the vessel?</span></li>
<li><span>And he said to me: That a house may be built for it in
the land of Sennaar, and that it may be established, and set there
upon its own basis.</span></li>

<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="6">Zacharias 6</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and saw: and behold
four chariots came out from the midst of two mountains: and the
mountains were mountains of brass.</span></li>
<li><span>In the first chariot were red horses, and in the second
chariot black horses.</span></li>
<li><span>And in the third chariot white horses, and in the fourth
chariot grisled horses, and strong ones.</span></li>
<li><span>And I answered, and said to the an- gel that spoke in me:
What are these, my lord?</span></li>
<li><span>And the angel answered, and said to me: These are the
four winds of the heaven, which go forth to stand before the Lord
of all the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>That in which were the black horses went forth into the
land of the north, and the white went forth after them: and the
grisled went forth to the land of the south.</span></li>
<li><span>And they that were most strong, went out, and sought to
go, and to run to and fro through all the earth. And he said: Go,
walk throughout the earth : and they walked throughout the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And he called me, and spoke to me, saying: Behold they
that go forth into the land of the north, have quieted my spirit in
the land of the north.</span></li>
<li><span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying :</span></li>
<li><span>Take of them of the captivity, of Holdai, and of Tobias,
and of Idaias; thou shalt come in that day, and shalt go into the
house of Josias, the son of Sophonias, who came out of
Babylon.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt take gold and silver: and shalt make
crowns, and thou shalt set them on the head of Jesus the son of
Josedec, the high priest.</span></li>
<li><span>And thou shalt speak to him, saying: Thus saith the Lord
of hosts, saying: BEHOLD A MAN, THE ORIENT IS HIS NAME: and under
him shall he spring up, and shall build a temple to the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Yea, he shall build a temple to the Lord: and he shall
bear the glory, and shall sit, and rule upon his throne: and he
shall be a priest upon his throne, and the counsel of peace shall
be between them both.</span></li>
<li><span>And the crowns shall be to Helem, and Tobias, and Idaias,
and to Hem, the son of Sophonias, a memorial in the temple of the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And they that are far off, shall come and shall build in
the temple of the Lord: and you shall know that the Lord of hosts
sent me to you. But this shall come to pass, if hearing you will
hear the voice of the Lord your God.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="7">Zacharias 7</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius,
that the word of the Lord came to Zacharias, in the fourth day of
the ninth month, which is Casleu.</span></li>
<li><span>When Sarasar, and Rogommelech, and the men that were with
him, sent to the house of God, to entreat the face of the
Lord:</span></li>
<li><span>To speak to the priests of the house of the Lord of
hosts, and to the prophets, saying: Must I weep in the fifth month,
or must I sanctify myself as I have now done for many
years?</span></li>
<li><span>And the word of the Lord of hosts came to me,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests,
saying: When you fasted, and mourned in the fifth and the seventh
month for these seventy years: did you keep a fast unto
me?</span></li>
<li><span>And when you did eat and drink, did you not eat for
yourselves, and drink for yourselves?</span></li>
<li><span>Are not these the words which the Lord spoke by the hand
of the former prophets, when Jerusalem as yet was inhabited, and
was wealthy, both itself and the cities round about it, and there
were inhabitants towards the south, and in the plain?</span></li>
<li><span>And the word of the Lord came to Zacharias,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts, saying: Judge ye true
judgment, and shew ye mercy and compassion every man to his
brother.</span></li>
<li><span>And oppress not the widow, and the fatherless, and the
stranger, and the poor: and let not a man devise evil in his heart
against his brother.</span></li>
<li><span>But they would not hearken, and they turned away the
shoulder to depart: and they stopped their ears, not to
hear.</span></li>
<li><span>And they made their heart as the adamant stone, lest they
should hear the law, and the words which the Lord of hosts sent in
his spirit by the hand of the former prophets: so a great
indignation came from the Lord of hosts.</span></li>
<li><span>And it came to pass that as he spoke, and they heard not:
so shall they cry, and I will not hear, saith the Lord of
hosts.</span></li>
<li><span>And I dispersed them throughout all kingdoms, which they
know not: and the land was left desolate behind them, so that no
man passed through or returned: and they changed the delightful
land into a wilderness.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
<div class="chaptertitle"><a name="8">Zacharias 8</a></div>
<ol>
<li><span>And the word of the Lord of hosts came to me,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I have been jealous for
Sion with a great jealousy, and with a great indignation have I
been jealous for her.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I am returned to Sion, and
I will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be
called The city of truth, and the mountain of the Lord of hosts,
The sanctified mountain.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: There shall yet old men and
old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem: and every man with his
staff in his hand through multitude of days.</span></li>
<li><span>And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and
girls, playing in the streets thereof.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: If it seem hard in the eyes
of the remnant of this people in those days: shall it be hard in my
eyes, saith the Lord of hosts?</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts : Behold I will save my
people from the land of the east, and from the land of the going
down of the sun.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst
of Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God
in truth and in justice.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Let your hands be
strengthened, you that hear in these days these words by the mouth
of the prophets, in the day that the house of the Lord of hosts was
founded, that the temple might be built.</span></li>
<li><span>For before those days there was no hire for men, neither
was there hire for beasts, neither was there peace to him that came
in, nor to him that went out, because of the tribulation: and I let
all men go every one against his neighbour.</span></li>
<li><span>But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people
according to the former days, saith the Lord of hosts.</span></li>
<li><span>But there shall be the seed of peace: the vine shall
yield her fruit, and the earth shall give her increase, and the
heavens shall give their dew: and I will cause the remnant of this
people to possess all these things.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall come to pass, that as you were a curse among
the Gentiles, O house of Juda, and house of Israel: so will I save
you, and you shall be a blessing: fear not, let your hands be
strengthened.</span></li>
<li><span>For thus saith the Lord of hosts: As I purposed to
afflict you, when your fathers had provoked me to wrath, saith the
Lord,</span></li>
<li><span>And I had no mercy: so turning again I have thought in
these days to do good to the house of Juda, and Jerusalem: fear
not.</span></li>
<li><span>These then are the things, which you shall do: Speak ye
truth every one to his neighbour: judge ye truth and judgment of
peace in your gates.</span></li>
<li><span>And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against
his friend: and love not a false oath: for all these are the things
that I hate, saith the Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And the word of the Lord of hosts came to me,
saying:</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts: The fast of the fourth
month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and
the fast of the tenth shall be to the house of Juda, joy, and
gladness, and great solemnities: only love ye truth and
peace.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts, until people come, and
dwell in many cities,</span></li>
<li><span>And the inhabitants go one to another, saying: Let us go,
and entreat the face of the Lord, and let us seek the Lord of
hosts: I also will go.</span></li>
<li><span>And many peoples, and strong nations shall come to seek
the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the face of the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts : In those days, wherein ten
men of all languages of the Gentiles shall take hold, and shall
hold fast the shirt of one that is a Jew, saying: We will go with
you: for we have heard that God is with you.</span></li>

Hadrach, and of Damascus the rest thereof: for the eye of man, and
of all the tribes of Israel is the Lord's.</span></li>
<li><span>Emath also in the borders thereof, and Tyre, and Sidon:
for they have taken to themselves to be exceeding wise.</span></li>
<li><span>And Tyre hath built herself a strong hold, and heaped
together silver as earth, and gold as the mire of the
streets.</span></li>
<li><span>Behold the Lord shall possess her, and shall strike her
strength in the sea, and she shall be devoured with
fire.</span></li>
<li><span>Ascalon shall see, and shall fear, and Gaza, and shall be
very sorrowful: and Accaron, because her hope is confounded : and
the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ascalon shall not be
inhabited.</span></li>
<li><span>And the divider shall sit in Azotus, and I will destroy
the pride of the Philistines.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his
abominations from between his teeth: and even he shall be left to
our God, and he shall be as a governor in Juda, and Accaron as a
Jebusite.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will encompass my house with them that serve me in
war, going and returning, and the oppressor shall no more pass
through them: for now I have seen with my eyes.</span></li>
<li><span>Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Sion, shout for joy, O
daughter of Jerusalem: BEHOLD THY KING will come to thee, the just
and saviour: he is poor, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt
the foal of an ass.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will destroy the chariot out of Ephraim, and the
horse out of Jerusalem, and the bow for war shall be broken: and he
shall speak peace to the Gentiles, and his power shall be from sea
to sea, and from the rivers even to the end of the
earth.</span></li>
<li><span>Thou also by the blood of thy testament hast sent forth
thy prisoners out of the pit, wherein is no water.</span></li>
<li><span>Return to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope, I will
render thee double at, I declare to day.</span></li>
<li><span>Because I have bent Juda for me as a bow, I have filled
Ephraim: and I will raise up thy sons, O Sion, above thy sons, O
Greece, and I will make thee as the sword of the
mighty.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord God shall be seen over them, and his dart
shall go forth as lightning: and the Lord God will sound the
trumpet, and go in the whirlwind of the south.</span></li>
<li><span>The Lord of hosts will protect them: and they shall
devour, and subdue with the stones of the sling: and drinking they
shall be inebriated as it were with wine, and they shall be filled
as bowls, and as the horns of the altar.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord their God will save them in that day, as the
dock of his people: for holy stones shall be lifted up over his
land.</span></li>
<li><span>For what is the good thing of him, and what is his
beautiful thing, but the corn of the elect, and wine springing
forth virgins?</span></li>

<li><span>Ask ye of the Lord rain in the latter season, and the
Lord will make snows, and will give them showers of rain, to every
one grass in the field.</span></li>
<li><span>For the idols have spoken what was unprofitable, and the
diviners have seen a lie, and the dreamers have spoken vanity: they
comforted in vain: therefore they were led away as a dock: they
shall be afflicted, because they have no shepherd.</span></li>
<li><span>My wrath is kindled against the shepherds, and I will
visit upon the buck goats: for the Lord of hosts hath visited his
flock, the house of Juda, and hath made them as the horse of his
glory in the battle.</span></li>
<li><span>Out of him shall come forth the corner, out of him the
pin, out of him the bow of battle, out of him every exacter
together.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall be as mighty men, treading under foot the
mire of the ways in battle: and they shall fight, because the Lord
is with them, and the riders of horses shall be
confounded.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will strengthen the house of Juda, and save the
house of Joseph: and I will bring them back again, because I will
have mercy on them: and they shall be as they were when I had cast
them off, for I am the Lord their God, and will hear
them.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall be as the valiant men of Ephraim, and
their heart shall rejoice as through wine: and their children shall
see, and shall rejoice, and their heart shall be joyful in the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>I will whistle for them, and I will gather them together,
because I have redeemed them: and I will multiply them as they were
multiplied before.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will sow them among peoples: and from afar they
shall remember me: and they shall live with their children, and
shall return.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will bring them back out of the land of Egypt, and
will gather them from among the Assyrians: and will bring them to
the land of Galaad, and Libanus, and place shall not be found for
them.</span></li>
<li><span>And he shall pass over the strait of the sea, and shall
strike the waves in the sea, and all the depths of the river shall
be confounded, and the pride of Assyria shall be humbled, and the
sceptre of Egypt shall depart.</span></li>
<li><span>I will strengthen them in the Lord, and they shall walk
in his name, saith the Lord.</span></li>

<li><span>Open thy gates, 0 Libanus, and let fire devour thy
cedars.</span></li>
<li><span>Howl, thou fir tree, for the cedar is fallen, for the
mighty are laid waste: howl, ye oaks of Basan, because the fenced
forest is cut down.</span></li>
<li><span>The voice of the howling of the shepherds, because their
glory is laid waste: the voice of the roaring of the lions, because
the pride of the Jordan is spoiled.</span></li>
<li><span>Thus saith the Lord my God: Feed the flock of the
slaughter,</span></li>
<li><span>Which they that possessed, slew, and repented not, and
they sold them, saying: Blessed be the Lord, we are become rich:
and their shepherds spared them not.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will no more spare the inhabitants of the land,
saith the Lord: behold I will deliver the men, every one into his
neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall
destroy the land, and I will not deliver it out of their
hand.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will feed the hock of slaughter for this, O ye poor
of the dock. And I took unto me two rods, one I called Beauty, and
the other I called a Cord, and I fed the flock.</span></li>
<li><span>And I cut off three shepherds in one month, and my soul
was straitened in their regard: for their soul also varied in my
regard.</span></li>
<li><span>And I said: I will not feed you: that which dieth, let it
die: and that which is cut off, let it be cut off: and let the rest
devour every one the flesh of his neighbour.</span></li>
<li><span>And I took my rod that was called Beauty, and I cut it
asunder to make void my covenant, which I had made with all
people.</span></li>
<li><span>And it was made void in that day: and so the poor of the
flock that keep for me, understood that it is the word of the
Lord.</span></li>
<li><span>And I said to them: If it be good in your eyes, bring
hither my wages: and if not, be quiet. And they weighed for my
wages thirty pieces of silver.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to me: Cast it to the statuary, a
handsome price, that I was prized at by them. And I took the thirty
pieces of silver, and I cast them into the house of the Lord to the
statuary.</span></li>
<li><span>And I cut off my second rod that was called a Cord, that
I might break the brotherhood between Juda and Israel.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord said to me: Take to thee yet the instruments
of a foolish shepherd.</span></li>
<li><span>For behold I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who
shall not visit what is forsaken, nor seek what is scattered, nor
heal what is broken, nor nourish that which standeth, and he shall
eat the flesh of the fat ones, and break their hoofs.</span></li>
<li><span>O shepherd, and idol, that forsaketh the flock: the sword
upon his arm and upon his right eye: his arm shall quite wither
away, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.</span></li>

<li><span>The burden of the word of the Lord upon Israel. Thus
saith the Lord, who stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the
foundations of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man in him
:</span></li>
<li><span>Behold I will make Jerusalem a lintel of surfeiting to
all the people round about: and Juda also shall be in the siege
against Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will make
Jerusalem a burdensome stone to all people: all that shall lift it
up shall be rent and torn, and all the kingdoms of the earth shall
be gathered together against her.</span></li>
<li><span>In that day, saith the Lord, I will strike every horse
with astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open my
eyes upon the house of Juda, and will strike every horse of the
nations with blindness.</span></li>
<li><span>And the governors of Juda shall say in their heart: Let
the inhabitants of Jerusalem be strengthened for me in the Lord of
hosts, their God.</span></li>
<li><span>In that day I will make the governors of Juda like a
furnace of fire amongst wood, and as a firebrand amongst hay: and
they shall devour all the people round about, to the right hand,
and to the left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own
place in Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord shall save the tabernacles of Juda, as in
the beginning: that the house of David, and the glory of the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, may not boast and magnify themselves
against Juda.</span></li>
<li><span>In that day shall the Lord protect the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, and he that hath offended among them in that day shall
be as David: and the house of David, as that of God, as an angel of
the Lord in their sight.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek
to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will pour out upon the house of David, and upon the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace, and of prayers: and
they shall look upon me, whom they have pierced: and they shall
mourn for him as one mourneth for an only son, and they shall
grieve over him, as the manner is to grieve for the death of the
firstborn.</span></li>
<li><span>In that day there shall be a great lamentation in
Jerusalem like the lamentation of Adadremmon in the plain of
Mageddon.</span></li>
<li><span>And the land shall mourn: families and families apart:
the families of the house of David apart, and their women
apart:</span></li>
<li><span>The families of the house of Nathan apart, and their
women apart: the families of the house of Levi apart, and their
women apart: the families of Semei apart, and their women
apart.</span></li>

<li><span>In that day there shall be a fountain open to the house
of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: for the washing of
the sinner, and of the unclean woman.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord of
hosts, that I will destroy the names of idols out of the earth, and
they shall be remembered no more: and I will take away the false
prophets, and the unclean spirit out of the earth.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall come to pass, that when any man shall
prophesy any more, his father and his mother that brought him into
the world, shall say to him: Thou shalt not live: because thou best
spoken a lie in the name of the Lord. And his father, and his
mother, his parents, shall thrust him through, when he shall
prophesy.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets
shall be confounded, every one by his own vision, when he shall
prophesy, neither shall they be clad with a garment of sackcloth,
to deceive :</span></li>
<li><span>But he shall say: I am no prophet, I am a husbandman: for
Adam is my ex- ample from my youth.</span></li>
<li><span>And they shall say to him: What are these wounds in the
midst of thy hands? And he shall say: With these I was wounded in
the house of them that loved me.</span></li>
<li><span>Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man
that cleaveth to me, saith the Lord of hosts: strike the shepherd,
and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn my hand to the
little ones.</span></li>
<li><span>And there shall be in all the earth, saith the Lord, two
parts in it shall be scattered, and shall perish: but the third
part shall be left therein.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will bring the third part through the fire, and
will refine them as silver is refined: and I will try them as gold
is tried. They shall call on my name, and I will hear them. I will
say: Thou art my people: and they shall say: The Lord is my
God.</span></li>

<li><span>Behold the days of the Lord shall come, and thy spoils
shall be divided in the midst of thee.</span></li>
<li><span>And I will gather all nations to Jerusalem to battle, and
the city shall be taken, and the houses shall be rifled, and the
women shall be defiled: and half of the city shall go forth into
captivity, and the rest of the people shall not be taken away out
of the city.</span></li>
<li><span>Then the Lord shall go forth, and shall fight against
those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.</span></li>
<li><span>And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of
Olives, which is over against Jerusalem toward the east: and the
mount of Olives shall be divided in the midst thereof to the east,
and to the west with a very great opening, and half of the mountain
shall be separated to the north, and half thereof to the
south.</span></li>
<li><span>And you shall flee to the valley of those mountains, for
the valley of the mountains shall be joined even to the next, and
you shall flee r as you fled from the face of the earthquake in the
days of Ozias king of Juda: and the Lord my God shall come, and all
the saints with him.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall come to pass in that day, that there shall
be no light, but cold and frost.</span></li>
<li><span>And there shall be one day, which is known to the Lord,
not day nor night : and in the time of the evening there shall be
light.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall come to pass in that day, that living waters
shall go out from Jerusalem: half of them to the east sea, and half
of them to the last sea: they shall be in summer and in
winter.</span></li>
<li><span>And the Lord shall be king over all the earth: in that
day there shall be one Lord, and his name shall be one.</span></li>
<li><span>And all the land shall return even to the desert, from
the hill to Remmon to the south of Jerusalem: and she shall be
exalted, and shall dwell in her own place, from the gate of
Benjamin even to the place of the former gate, and even to the gate
of the corners: and from the tower of Hananeel even to the king's
wine- presses.</span></li>
<li><span>And people shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more
an anathema: but Jerusalem shall sit secure.</span></li>
<li><span>And this shall be the plague where with the Lord shall
strike all nations that have fought against Jerusalem: the flesh of
every one shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and
their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue
shall consume away in their mouth.</span></li>
<li><span>In that day there shall be a great tumult from the Lord
among them: and a man shall take the hand of his neighbour, and his
hand shall be clasped upon his neighbour's hand.</span></li>
<li><span>And even Juda shall fight against Jerusalem: and the
riches of all nations round about shall be gathered together, gold,
and silver, and garments in great abundance.</span></li>
<li><span>And the destruction of the horse, and of the mule, and of
the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts, that shall be in
those tents, shall be like this destruction.</span></li>
<li><span>And all they that shall be left of all nations that came
against Jerusalem, shall go up from year to year, to adore the
King, the Lord of hosts, and to keep the feast of
tabernacles.</span></li>
<li><span>And it shall come to pass, that he that shall not go up
of the families of the land to Jerusalem, to adore the King, the
Lord of hosts, there shall be no rain upon them.</span></li>
<li><span>And if the family of Egypt go not up nor come: neither
shall it be upon them, but there shall be destruction wherewith the
Lord will strike all nations that will not go up to keep the feast
of tabernacles.</span></li>
<li><span>This shall be the sin of Egypt, and this the sin of all
nations, that will not go up to keep the feast of
tabernacles.</span></li>
<li><span>In that day that which is upon the bridle of the horse
shall be holy to the Lord: and the caldrons in the house of the
Lord shall be as the phials before the altar.</span></li>
<li><span>And every caldron in Jerusalem and Juda shall be
sanctified to the Lord of hosts: and all that sacrifice shall come,
and take of them, and shall seethe in them: and the merchant shall
be no more in the house of the Lord of hosts in that
day.</span></li>
